            <bold>Distribution of Aggregate Buy/Sell Counts (575 stocks)</bold>       
          
          <ul>
            <li>
                Since stock prices of the 575 stocks under consideration may not be independent random variables,
                one cannot use a trinomial distribution of independent trials for calculating percentiles of counts
            </li>
            <li>
                To address the correlation among stock prices, a multi-variate normal distribution was utilized to
                study the interaction between 'buy' and 'sell' counts
            </li>
            <li>
                Using the stock prices in the data set a multi-variate normal distiribution was modelled, from which
                10,000 simulated values of buy-sell pairs were generated.
            </li>
            <li>
                This simulated data set was used to observe the conditional distribution of buy/sell counts while
                fixing the value of sell/buy respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 90th percentile of sell/buy counts so obtained were used to assign "Buy", "Sell" or "Hold" for
                a given date.
