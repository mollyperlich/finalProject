Once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter, tech is now accused of inflaming, radicalizing, dumbing down and squeezing the masses. Tech company stocks have been pummeled from their highs. Regulation looms. Even tech executives are calling for it.In the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash \u2014 Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank \u2014 to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny.That is not the path the companies are taking.\u201cThe tech companies are not flinching,\u201d said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. \u201cNothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They\u2019re going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.\u201dThere is so much of life that remains undisrupted. The companies are competing to own the cloud \u2014 to become, in essence, the internet\u2019s landlord. They have designs on cities: Google made a deal in 2017 to reimagine a chunk of waterfront Toronto from the ground up. Amazon is reworking the definition of community from the inside, as warehouses in rural areas provide the urban middle class with everything they want to stay home all weekend.These changes are only beginning to redefine society. When every home has an Amazon Echo, Google Home, an Apple HomePod or some other smart speaker, the companies are already signaling, all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled. For those who insist on venturing out, there will be driverless cars operated by Big Tech. And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence, with consequences unclear even to them.To accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees, which means it needs somewhere to put them. This isn\u2019t a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters. It means building new campuses around the country.Big Tech\u2019s push into New York City and the Washington area has been well documented in recent months, with Google bulking up in the first and Amazon planning satellite offices in both. But even in its backyard of Silicon Valley, which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even well-paid engineers can scarcely afford, there is a boom that, if anything, is accelerating.Anyone who wants to believe Big Tech is chastened should visit a section of San Jose just west of downtown, a jumble of carwashes and auto-body shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments. On a short street there is a house nearly a century old, a tiny thing with only one bath. Google bought it and another house last month in a package deal for $4 million, according to county documents reviewed by The Mercury News.ImageA broken window reflecting construction in San Jose, where Google is putting together a campus that will total eight million square feet.CreditJames Tensuan for The New York TimesImageThe Google campus will provide offices for 20,000 employees \u2014 more than the company\u2019s total work force a decade ago.CreditJames Tensuan for The New York TimesMultiply that real estate transaction by dozens, big parcels and small, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to date. Google is planning very long term here. The buses, light rail, Caltrain and Amtrak trains that converge on the Diridon Station transit center will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth. The eventual result will be a new Google campus of eight million square feet with offices for 20,000 workers, a figure that is more than the company\u2019s total employment in 2009.But Diridon Station is just a part of Google\u2019s Silicon Valley expansion. A week before the company got the two houses, it bought a 100,000-square-foot building in Palo Alto, Calif., for $70 million.Facebook keeps growing, too. In the spring, it leased one million square feet in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale for its fast-growing community operations team, which deals with safety and security issues confronting Facebook users. And it will soon move this year into 750,000 square feet in a San Francisco tower, making it the third-biggest tech tenant in the city, after Salesforce and Uber.In total, Google\u2019s employment increased 21 percent in the last year. Facebook\u2019s work force rose by 45 percent in that time, to 34,000, and it is advertising 2,700 additional jobs.Amazon\u2019s head count tripled over the last three years, thanks to its warehouses and the acquisition of Whole Foods. It is only the second company in the United States to employ more than 500,000 people \u2014 and that is not counting its contractors.The expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech: It is barely getting started.\u201cFor all intents and purposes, we\u2019re only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. \u201cThe image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for them.\u201dThat\u2019s evident in how robust Big Tech\u2019s businesses remain. Last March, the research firm eMarketer said Facebook, including its less controversial photo-sharing site, Instagram, would earn $21 billion this year from digital ads in the United States. In September, it raised that forecast to $22.87 billion.EMarketer also revised up its forecasts of Google\u2019s digital ad revenues in the United States for 2018, 2019 and 2020. The third big digital advertising recipient is Amazon, which is far behind the leaders but gaining ground fast.The contradiction is becoming increasingly obvious. One important way Big Tech serves its customers is by tracking their movements and purchases, which is beginning to unnerve at least some of us. In a Pew Research Center survey in June, 42 percent of adult Facebook users said they had taken a break of several weeks from the site. But even as we say we trust tech less, we invite it deeper into our lives.ImageApple\u2019s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., during construction in early 2017. Combined third-quarter revenue for Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent company was up 24 percent in 2018.CreditNoah Berger/ReutersApple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, together generated $166.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018 alone \u2014 up 24 percent from a year earlier, when the four companies hauled in $134.4 billion.\u201cMuch as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide,\u201d said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Big Tech needs to be regulated, many are beginning to argue, and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government.\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have a good clue,\u201d said Mr. Bajarin, the consultant. \u201cThey\u2019re not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation.\u201dWhich leaves regulation up to the companies themselves, always a dubious proposition.\u201cFor Facebook to have a better year in 2019, it needs to be more upfront and transparent,\u201d said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer. This was also the advice Facebook got for 2018, to little avail.All this could change if the anti-tech mood continues to swell or the economy hits a really rough patch. On the other hand, the last recession tended to work in Big Tech\u2019s favor by giving smaller competitors even more to worry about.During the 2008 financial crisis, Amazon\u2019s North American media sales increased 20 percent. Borders, one of its biggest book-selling competitors, saw revenue drop 9 percent, reported a record loss and was soon defunct.With so little to really worry about, Big Tech is planning for a future far beyond any present-day turmoil. Google, which has 3,500 job openings, says it is too early to say what the thousands of Diridon employees will do. But Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California, has a good idea: everything.\u201cThey\u2019re in the transportation business, the medical business, every business,\u201d said Mr. Taplin, a frequent critic of how Big Tech took over a decentralized, independent internet. \u201cThere is no aspect of your life that they will not be involved in.\u201d"}, {"title": "On Politics: Elizabeth Warren Is Running for President", "category": "Politics", "id": "6b50062b-e205-4c0f-8542-50a34fc006b8", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-president.html", "publishdate": 20190101, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Tuesday morning and Happy New Year. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today._____________________\u2022 Senator Elizabeth Warren, a sharp critic of big banks and unregulated capitalism, is running for president in 2020. Ms. Warren said she was forming a presidential exploratory committee, which allows her to raise money and hire staff before a formal kickoff.\u2022 Ms. Warren\u2019s announcement marks the beginning of a new year and new campaign that will feature an unusually large number of Democrats seeking the presidency. The question is: Who, if anyone, matches the political moment?\u2022 With the next presidential election almost two years away, Ms. Warren and other candidates may seem to be starting their campaigns early. But they\u2019re actually right on schedule.\u2022 House Democrats have agreed on a proposal to end the partial government shutdown that would extend current levels of funding for the Department of Homeland Security, but that doesn\u2019t include money for President Trump\u2019s border wall.\u2022 John F. Kelly, the departing White House chief of staff, said the Trump administration had long since abandoned the idea of a concrete border wall.\u2022 Mr. Trump has agreed to give the military about four months to withdraw the 2,000 United States troops in Syria, a backtrack from his abrupt order two weeks ago that the military pull out within 30 days.\u2022 Letitia James, New York\u2019s new attorney general, has been forthright in her desire to use her office to pursue Mr. Trump. But her strident attacks on the president could threaten the legal standing of cases that her office brings against him and his business interests.\u2022 A year after the retirement of a prominent appeals court judge accused of sexual harassment, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the federal judicial system must do more to protect law clerks and other employees from abusive conduct.\u2022 The Democratic sweep in Orange County is the latest sign of a huge political and cultural shift in a former Republican stronghold.\u2022 Just a few weeks after a Russian operative was convicted of conspiracy in the United States, an American citizen has been detained in Moscow on espionage charges._____________________Today\u2019s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grull\u00f3n Paz in New York.Were you forwarded this newsletter?

Four cases in December show that reality.William T. Walters, one of America\u2019s most famous gamblers, had his convictions for insider trading affirmed on Dec. 4 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan. He is serving a five-year prison term for trading shares of Dean Foods based on information he received from the former chairman of the company\u2019s board, Thomas Davis.His case was less about insider trading law and more about whether the investigation was tainted by what Mr. Walters\u2019s lawyer labeled \u201cextraordinary government misconduct.\u201d The government admitted before trial that David Chaves, an F.B.I. special agent, leaked information about the investigation to reporters at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. The defense argued that Mr. Chaves made the disclosures to revive a dormant investigation, which led to Mr. Davis\u2019s cooperation with the government and testimony against Mr. Walters.The appeals court called the agent\u2019s conduct \u201chighly improper\u201d and said that the leaks \u201cviolated the grand jury secrecy provision\u201d of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). Still, the court found that the leaks did not taint Mr. Walters\u2019s conviction because the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict was not influenced by the news media reports. Thus, the convictions stand despite the misconduct of Mr. Chaves.In a second criminal insider trading case, prosecutors asked the Federal District Court in Manhattan on Dec. 4 to schedule a retrial of Sean Stewart, a former investment banker whose convictions were overturned in November. The appeals court found that the trial judge improperly excluded evidence that could be used to undermine a statement made by Mr. Stewart\u2019s father that was the linchpin of the government\u2019s case that Mr. Stewart improperly tipped his father to the impending deals.Mr. Stewart\u2019s father said his son once berated him for not trading on information that he provided on a \u201csilver platter.\u201d Although the statement is problematic, the defense will have a better opportunity at the retrial to show the father might have just made it up. After his arrest, the father told agents that his son did not know about the trading or tipping of confidential information.In insider trading prosecutions, it is up to the jury to decide whom to believe when a defendant denies having any improper motive. The problem for a defendant like Mr. Stewart is that the widely held perception that Wall Street bankers trade on inside information is difficult to overcome.Also in December, the Federal District Court in Atlanta rejected an effort by Jun Ying, the former chief information officer at Equifax, to dismiss insider trading charges. Mr. Ying exercised all of his vested stock options and sold nearly $1 million in shares a little more than a week before the company disclosed the hack of its database in September 2017, according to the S.E.C. He argued that the government had not shown that he had \u201cused\u201d confidential information about the hack when he sold the shares.The question of how the government can show a defendant used inside information, even if it can prove the person knew it, can be difficult. In this case, prosecutors are relying on internet searches Mr. Ying conducted into the effect of hacks on other credit reporting companies, like Experian, and the timing of the trades to show that he must have based the trading decision on the inside information he gathered about the hacking at Equifax and not a more benign reason. By selling the shares when he did, the defendant gained $480,000. That\u2019s something a jury is likely to view suspiciously. The stock dropped over 15 percent after news of the data breach was made public.The government often portrays insider trading as motivated by greed, and the opportunity to make money can prove irresistible when the only real victim of the violation is the faceless securities market.The lure of easy profits is apparent in civil charges filed by the S.E.C. against Rajeshwar R. Gannamaneni and his wife and father for trading ahead of 40 deals over four years. Mr. Gannamaneni was an information technology contractor for an investment bank in Singapore, and the three defendants are accused of making almost $600,000 from their trading.Hiding insider trading can be difficult if a person makes outsize profits, which will quickly draw the attention of the stock and options exchanges. But if one can keep the trading profits small, there is a chance that it might fly under the radar, at least for a time. The problem with this approach is that making a little bit of money is not nearly as satisfying as making a lot, so greed starts to take over.The charges against Mr. Gannamaneni and the other two defendants show that they started small, usually making a profit of less than $10,000, and once only $78. But by 2015 and 2016, their profit on trades was as high as $55,000. That is sure to draw the interest of the S.E.C.\u2019s market surveillance office, which looks for patterns of successful trading.The lesson from Mr. Gannamaneni\u2019s case is that confidential information exerts a powerful pull to make more and more easy money, which means that one is much more likely to get caught. So if you think the government will not notice your well-timed trades, increasing your profit means there is a much higher chance that you will be discovered."}, {"title": "Netflix Blocks Show in Saudi Arabia Critical of Saudi Prince", "category": "Business", "id": "d4a6eba1-e5d7-4300-9c5e-8d3ff1ea7dbf", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/business/media/netflix-hasan-minhaj-saudi-arabia.html", "publishdate": 20190101, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/02/business/02NETFLIX-01/02NETFLIX-01-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Netflix has blocked an episode of its show \u201cPatriot Act With Hasan Minhaj\u201d from streaming in Saudi Arabia after the Saudi government complained that the episode \u2014 which is critical of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman \u2014 violated its cybercrime laws.In the episode, first shown in October, Mr. Minhaj critiques the United States\u2019 longstanding relationship with Saudi Arabia after the murder of the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\u201cNow would be a good time to reassess our relationship with Saudi Arabia,\u201d Mr. Minhaj said, \u201cand I mean that as a Muslim and an American.\u201dAfter receiving a takedown request last month from the Saudi government\u2019s Communications and Information Technology Commission, Netflix removed the episode from viewing in Saudi Arabia last week. The news was first reported by  The Financial Times.In a statement, Netflix defended its decision: \u201cWe strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request \u2014 and to comply with local law.\u201dThe episode remains available to Netflix customers elsewhere in the world, and it can also be seen by viewers in Saudi Arabia through the show\u2019s YouTube channel, according to The Financial Times. YouTube did not immediately respond on Tuesday to an email asking whether it had received a complaint from the Saudi government.The \u201cPatriot Act\u201d episode appears to be the only program that the Saudi government has asked Netflix to block there.Mr. Minhaj has not commented publicly on the removal of the episode. But in an interview published in The Atlantic last month, Mr. Minhaj spoke of the fear he felt after creating it.\u201cThere was a lot of discussion in my family about not doing it,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cI\u2019ve just come to personal and spiritual terms with what the repercussions are.\u201dArticle 6 of the Saudi anti-cyber crime law, which was cited by the Saudi commission in its request to Netflix, prohibits the \u201cproduction, preparation, transmission or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals and privacy\u201d on the internet. Journalism advocates call it a powerful and all-encompassing instrument for the Saudi government to censor virtually any speech online.The Committee to Protect Journalists, which rates Saudi Arabia the third most censored country in the world, has documented the growing crackdown on journalists since the appointment last year of Prince Mohammed, who was first promoted as an agent of modernization and reform.Under Prince Mohammed\u2019s rule, \u201cauthorities have wielded state mechanisms ostensibly focused on terrorism to silence journalists,\u201d according to a blog post published in September by the Committee to Protect Journalists.The Communications and Information Technology Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.It is not unheard of for Western news organizations to have critical reports censored in authoritarian countries. But that action is often taken by local partners, and sometimes without notice.In 2014, for example, a report about Pakistan\u2019s relationship to Al Qaeda was deleted from thousands of print copies of the International New York Times in Pakistan \u2014 resulting in a blank spot on the front page \u2014 \u201cwithout our knowledge or agreement,\u201d a representative of The Times said at the time."}, {"title": "Curbs on A.I.

And they found it within earshot, in radio shows like \u201cThe Lone Ranger,\u201d \u201cOur Miss Brooks\u201d and \u201cDragnet,\u201d which were among the first TV hits.With the rise of streaming, the entertainment industry is going through a similar transformation. Executives at Netflix, Amazon and Apple are spending wildly for content, which has created a sense of urgency among their rivals at broadcast networks and cable channels. And like their midcentury predecessors, they have been aggressive about buying up ready-made programming to fill their expanding slates. These days, that means podcasts.\u201cHomecoming,\u201d the Amazon series starring Julia Roberts, is based on a fictional podcast from Gimlet Media. Bravo\u2019s \u201cDirty John,\u201d with Eric Bana in the role of the con man John Meehan, is based on a true crime series from The Los Angeles Times and the podcast network Wondery.Hernan Lopez, a former Fox executive who founded Wondery, has blurred distinctions between the podcasting world and Hollywood by giving his shows tag lines, trailers and advertising billboards. \u201cI set out to create a company that could build on bringing to podcasting the skill set of television and movies, both in storytelling and production, as well as marketing,\u201d he said.Amazon\u2019s \u201cLore,\u201d which was recently renewed for a second season, is another one that made the transition, having started as an anthology podcast of scary, real-life tales hosted by the writer Aaron Mahnke. \u201cUp and Vanished,\u201d a special that aired in November on Oxygen, was based on a podcast hosted by the documentary filmmaker Payne Lindsey about the disappearance of Tara Grinstead, a Georgia beauty pageant queen and high school teacher. The independent production company Propagate helped bring it to the screen.Ben Silverman, the co-chief executive of Propagate, said podcasts make for good source material partly because their fans are not passive. \u201cIt\u2019s a very active process to download a podcast,\u201d said Mr. Silverman, whose company is also working on an adaptation of \u201cSword and Scale,\u201d a true crime podcast from Wondery. \u201cAnd so we hope that fans of the podcasts are likely to be active enough to come and watch the show, once it gets produced.\u201dBefore the spate of narrative fare, talk and variety shows made the jump from audio to TV. \u201cComedy Bang! Bang!,\u201d which started as a radio show before it became a much-downloaded podcast, had a five-year run on IFC. Following its leap from podcast to TV were \u201c2 Dope Queens,\u201d a series of live specials on HBO starring Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson, and \u201cPod Save America,\u201d the political show, also on HBO, hosted by the writer and producer Jon Lovett and three men who worked under President Barack Obama, Jon Favreau, Dan Pfeiffer and Tommy Vietor.ImageThe documentary filmmaker Payne Lindsey, whose true-crime podcast \u201cUp and Vanished\u201d was adapted into a special by the cable channel Oxygen.CreditPropagateAs podcasts have become more elaborate, with complex stories complete with cliffhangers, narrative reversals and subplots, the main action in adaptations has shifted toward scripted series.Mindful of the trend, Gimlet hired Jenny Wall, a former Hulu and Netflix executive, as chief marketing officer, to help the company better navigate Hollywood. \u201cWe created an I.P. factory,\u201d Matt Lieber, the president of Gimlet, said. \u201cWe generate a lot of stories.\u201dAmong other shows it has in the works, Gimlet has teamed with Blumhouse Television, an arm of the company that made the film \u201cGet Out,\u201d to create a TV version of its limited-run horror podcast, \u201cThe Horror of Dolores Roach.\u201d\u201cGladiator,\u201d a podcast made by Wondery and The Boston Globe\u2019s Spotlight investigative team focused on the NFL player Aaron Hernandez, who committed suicide after being convicted of murder, is in development at FX.

But the knotty building material is making a comeback.Seeking greener projects, which many consumers continue to embrace despite an anti-environmental mood in Washington, builders are choosing timber for offices, apartments and campus buildings, rather than the concrete and steel that dominated construction for decades.Not everybody is on board with the trend, which is playing out from coast to coast. Concerns persist about wood\u2019s flame resistance and strength, as well as its cost, which can be 30 percent more than traditional materials.But proponents scored a huge win last month when the International Code Council, an influential advisory group in Washington, concluded that some wooden buildings could climb as high as 18 stories, more than twice the current permissible height, without compromising safety.Consumers have already shown interest.\u201cThe connections people have with wood cannot be underestimated,\u201d said Tim Gokhman, the director of New Land Enterprises, which is behind two projects in Milwaukee that are mostly made of wood. One is a seven-story office building. The other is Ascent, a 201-unit luxury rental tower that, at 21 stories, would be the tallest timber building in the Western Hemisphere. Both await approvals \u2014 including permission to exceed height restrictions, which developers say will not pose any danger \u2014 but expect to break ground this year.Unlike the production of concrete and steel, which generates huge amounts of carbon dioxide, the creation of lumber is a relatively low-pollution process, Mr. Gokhman said.Trees are also an easily renewable resource, achieving nearly their full size in a decade, according to Jason Korb, an architect and a designer of both New Land projects. He added that the United States had some catching up to do, as wooden towers exist or are underway in Australia, Austria, Canada and Norway, among other places.\u201cIt\u2019s really starting to come into its own around the world right now,\u201d Mr. Korb said.For those who expect wooden buildings to resemble log cabins, the current crop may come as a surprise.ImageAn office building made with nailed wood in Brooklyn. City codes limit timber buildings to seven stories.CreditJohn Muggenborg for The New York TimesMost have metal or brick facades, a stipulation of building codes focused on fire restrictions, which means the buildings often do not stand out from the outside. Inside, though, gently striated lumber surfaces are on full display, as they are at Carbon12, an eight-story, 14-unit condominium in Portland, Ore., currently the country\u2019s tallest wood structure.In fact, there is so much exposed and unpainted wood, in columns, beams and ceilings, it gives the condos the appearance of a construction zone. Half the condos, which range from $800,000 to $1.3 million, have sold since the building opened last spring, said Ben Kaiser, the developer.Mr. Kaiser faced challenges getting Carbon12 built. The permitting process took almost two years to wind through city and state agencies, largely because wood buildings in Oregon could top out at no more than six stories, he said.In the end, officials concluded that wooden high-rises could help revive Oregon\u2019s stagnant timber industry, Mr. Kaiser said. In August, the state increased the height limit to 18 stories.Carbon12\u2019s timber, however, did not come cheap, according to Mr. Kaiser, whose  offices were also built with timber. Indeed, at $11 million, Carbon12 was about 20 percent more expensive to construct than a concrete version would have been, which in some ways dictated that it be a luxury condo.\u201cIt\u2019s like anything \u2014 the first iPhone, the first flat-screen TV,\u201d Mr. Kaiser said. \u201cCosts are high because not enough people are doing it.\u201dNevertheless, he plans to use wood from now on. In addition to their green benefits, he said, wood buildings perform well in earthquakes because of their lighter weight and flexibility.Proponents of wood must still overcome a longstanding bias. In the 1800s, fires were a scourge, prompting restrictions on wood. But steel is not infallible and can buckle in extreme heat, said John Peronto, a principal at the engineering firm Thornton Tomasetti who is involved in the two Milwaukee projects.\u201cBut we\u2019ve gotten comfortable using steel and concrete products, so the question\u2019s been, \u2018Why would we change?\u2019\u201d he said.Still, wood is not what it used to be. The decline in old-growth forests means developers can no longer count on huge single trunks to support floors. Instead, they rely on mass timber, an engineered product made of layers of spruce or fir pressed together in a way that is similar to plywood but with a more elegant look.Nail-laminated timber fortifies T3, a three-year-old, seven-story office building in Minneapolis\u2019s North Loop neighborhood. Eighty-two percent of the steel-clad building, whose name is shorthand for \u201ctimber, technology and transit,\u201d is leased to tenants like Amazon, which occupies three floors. Asking rents are about $23 a square foot, said David Schreiber, a managing director at LaSalle Investment Management, the landlord.Also leasing space there is Industrious, a co-working provider, which had to spend about 15 percent more than usual to add conference rooms and private offices to its floor, said Jamie Hodari, a company co-founder. Industrious had to route cables to avoid damaging the wood, he said.But the investment appears worthwhile. T3 is far more popular among workers than Industrious\u2019s other Minneapolis outpost, in a glassy modern high-rise, Mr. Hodari said.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like walking into a Swedish sauna,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly beautiful.\u201dHines, the real estate investment firm that developed T3, took inspiration from a nearby office building it owns, which began life as a 19th-century warehouse. Despite robust demand, the brick-and-timber edifice had high turnover because it lacked contemporary finishes like soundproofing, said Steve Luthman, a Hines senior managing director. T3 kept its natural aesthetic, but Hines added touches like airtight windows and a modern heating system.Hines is taking T3 nationwide to cities like Atlanta, where a seven-story, 250,000-square-foot offering, developed with Invesco Real Estate, will open in West Midtown this summer.Denver and Chicago will get similar towers, which may be less expensive to construct than their predecessors. Wood remains expensive, but the assembly-line aspect of mass-timber production, in which factories make large panels, then assemble them on-site, saves time and labor costs.ImageFlank used nailed wood instead of cross-laminated timber out of worries that its buildings might not be approved.CreditJohn Muggenborg for The New York Times\u201cI think it works out to about the same,\u201d Mr. Luthman said.For all the recent headway, there have been stumbles.In March, a 1,000-pound section of floor gave way at a mass-timber building under construction at Oregon State University. The floor was made of a relatively new product, cross-laminated timber, in which layers of wood are glued at right angles to each other. And two of the seven layers broke loose, said Steven Clark, a university spokesman.\u201cI think it had a quieting effect on the market,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople began to ask questions.\u201dBut after a four-month hiatus, construction of the $80 million building, Peavy Hall, resumed and is expected to be completed this year.Winning acceptance for mass timber seems especially challenging in New York, which appears to have lagged other cities in proposals. But a handful of projects are underway in Brooklyn, including a pair of office buildings in Williamsburg from the firm Flank.Those buildings, at three and five stories, conform to city codes, which limit timber buildings to seven stories. But the developer shied from cross-laminated timber because of worries that the buildings might not be approved. Flank went with nailed wood instead.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to try new things here,\u201d said Mick Walsdorf, a Flank managing partner.Because land is so expensive in New York, a short building can be unrealistic, developers say. Indeed, the height limit frustrated Jeff Spiritos, a developer who sought to build a 10-story timber condo near Manhattan\u2019s High Line but withdrew the plan after two years of discussions.A former Hines executive, Mr. Spiritos is looking to put up wooden multifamily structures outside the city, like in New Haven. But New York may soon be more appealing, because of that December vote by the International Code Council.Any change to New York\u2019s building code, which the City Council would need to ratify, could take years. But Mr. Spiritos called it \u201chumongous\u201d news all the same.\u201cI feel so strongly about the environmental imperative of changing the way we build,\u201d he added, \u201cfor the health of the planet.\u201d"}, {"title": "Chinese Companies Flocked to U.S. Markets in 2018.

In fact, it might have brought more Chinese companies to Wall Street.Tencent Music\u2019s trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange in December capped a wave of Chinese companies going public in the United States. In total, 33 Chinese firms raised $9.2 billion through initial public offerings on American exchanges \u2014 up 140 percent from 2017 and the highest level since 2014, according to Dealogic.Of course, 2014 comes with an asterisk of sorts. Alibaba went public in September that year, raising $25 billion. Subtract the value of Alibaba\u2019s offering and Chinese firms raised just $3 billion that year.Last year, however, offerings from Chinese firms dominated the United States market for initial public offerings. The three largest I.P.O.s by market value were Chinese companies. And Chinese firms accounted for four of the 10 largest such offerings in 2018 ranked by amount raised on American exchanges, the most of any country, including the United States, according to Dealogic.Why list in America?American exchanges offer prestige and a broader investor base that Chinese entrepreneurs can find attractive. The United States also offers a quicker route to the public markets. While Chinese regulators have taken steps to reduce the long wait, it still takes 18 months or longer for shares to begin trading from the time a company files to go public. That compares with just 42 days to list in the United States, according to Dealogic.But the trade war may also have been a factor.A slowing Chinese economy and escalating trade tensions dragged down markets in Hong Kong and China before stocks in the United States turned seriously wobbly. At their lows in late October, the Hang Seng stock index and the benchmark stock indexes in Shenzhen and Shanghai were down 15 percent to 35 percent for the year. By comparison, the S & P 500 was still up 2.5 percent at that point, making it far more attractive for offerings."}, {"title": "Hurricanes. Shootings. Fires.

Julie Bloom, a deputy editor for national coverage for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.As a deputy editor on the national desk, you oversee a lot of breaking news. What tech tools do you use to help? Hurricanes. Shootings. Wildfires. Elections and earthquakes. I didn\u2019t think anything could be as crazy as the fall of 2017 in this country, but 2018 came pretty close.I primarily oversee California and parts of the West, but also handle a lot of our coverage of major breaking news. With my colleagues on the desk and our boss, Marc Lacey, the national editor, we\u2019ve developed a tool kit of sorts to handle these stories that are fast-moving and intense.I feel like each day is a little like being caught in a batter\u2019s box without knowing when or where the balls are coming from, and that can be both exhilarating and exhausting. Technology certainly helps.My phone is pretty much everything. It\u2019s kind of its own command center, and I can do almost everything on it except edit. For stories, I still need my laptop. Most of the reporters know that if they get a call from me at an odd hour, it usually means they\u2019re on their way to something awful, but the reason we can do what we do is that they are total pros. Nobody ever just hangs up and goes back to sleep.In these cases, our job is to help them produce the best journalism possible in difficult situations and make sure they stay safe, too. I\u2019m in awe of the reporters on National who are relentless and often put themselves in danger while covering tough stories with compassion. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve done enough of them now that we kind of know what to do.Recently, we had a ton of breaking news out of California, where the majority of my reporters are based. The combination of the shooting in Thousand Oaks and the wildfires was a good example of having to be really nimble. One of our California reporters, Jenny Medina, called me in what was the middle of her night to say she and a bunch of F.B.I. agents who were in Thousand Oaks after the shooting had been forced to evacuate their hotel because of the fires. You can never predict what\u2019s next, so you just have to be ready to switch gears and work with what you have.In breaking news, I rely on Twitter and Dataminr, which monitors Twitter for newsworthy patterns, to keep track of developments. We\u2019re also paying attention to police scanners, local television and all forms of social media and trying to break and confirm our own scoops, too. The trick is being careful and fast at the same time. A lot of bad information gets out in the immediate aftermath, and you never want to get it wrong.In the middle of any given story, reporters and I communicate using text messages, Slack, Signal, Gchat and phone calls. We often spin off a Slack channel just for one event and have an email set up for breaking news that teams of reporters feed to. Those are split up into a bunch of different Google docs that we keep building out simultaneously for, say, a profile or a piece just on weapons or victims. Stories are updated dozens of times. We\u2019re also watching search trends and adjusting headlines to make sure we\u2019re showing up first. On a big, big story we\u2019ll also send out multiple alerts with new developments.Image\"My phone is pretty much everything,\" Ms. Bloom said. \"It\u2019s kind of its own command center.\"CreditIdris Solomon for The New York TimesMany of your reporters are based on the West Coast, while you are stationed in New York. How do you keep in touch with them and work with them on stories? Even though it\u2019s a different time zone, we\u2019re still covering the news no matter when and where it happens. My reporters are all early risers, or they\u2019re becoming ones. We have regular calls where we brainstorm ideas, but most editing is a constant back and forth over email, Gchat and text, and that seems to work well. We\u2019re fortunate because The Times has bureaus all over the place, so sometimes we hand off to Hong Kong or London and the editors there can help keep stories going.Your contributors sometimes report stories from odd situations, like natural disasters. What tools do they use, and how do they get stories to you expediently? For stories like wildfires or hurricanes, reporters often take satellite phones with them to make sure they can keep in contact when cell communication is down. But it doesn\u2019t always work. During the recent wildfires, one reporter, Julie Turkewitz, was one of the first to enter the fire zone in Paradise, Calif., with a team of forensic experts searching for remains, and we lost contact with her for a few hours right on deadline. Thankfully, she surfaced just in time.Sometimes good old dictation is the best means of getting scenes and reporting in real time. Reporters are also well versed in filing from their cars, Waffle Houses or the side of the road. We\u2019ve had a few instances in hurricanes when reporters have had to abandon their rental cars because they were flooding and get to safety and they still managed to file.You are a Los Angeles native. In your view, how has tech changed California? I grew up in the Los Angeles area and went to school at Berkeley and keep close ties to both parts of the state, and I go back a lot to see family. California is an endlessly exciting place for The Times to cover: It\u2019s the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, at the forefront of all sorts of change, extremely complex and a hotbed of contradictions. I like to think of it more as its own country. Technology is obviously a big part of all of that, and we\u2019re a long way from when I was a teenager on AOL Messenger.When you\u2019re not at work, what tech product do you use a lot?I\u2019m pretty low-tech in my nonwork life \u2014 or I try to be. When you\u2019re responsible for news, it\u2019s hard to let go. I\u2019ve tried everything from burying my phone under my kitchen sink to deleting certain apps on the weekend, but at a certain point you just relent and accept. I think social media is a mostly necessary evil and try to avoid it when I\u2019m not working, but I still haven\u2019t quit Instagram. Besides friends and family, I follow a lot of dancers and ballet companies \u2014 remnants from a former life \u2014 and museums, chefs and fashion designers. It\u2019s good to be reminded that there are people out there creating beautiful things, too.

One day after publishing a biting critique in The Washington Post that Mr. Trump \u201chas not risen to the mantle of the office,\u201d Mr. Romney declined to endorse the president\u2019s re-election, saying he wanted to consider \u201calternatives\u201d in 2020.But Mr. Romney also made clear that, while he is willing to confront the president like few other Republican lawmakers, he had little appetite to spend his first months as Utah\u2019s junior senator acting the part of Mr. Trump\u2019s critic in chief.\u201cI don\u2019t intend to be a daily commentator,\u201d he said in an interview on CNN, repeatedly declining to escalate his attacks on the president and explaining that he would speak out against Mr. Trump only on issues of \u201cgreat significance.\u201dMr. Romney\u2019s restraint in the interview was notably different from the tone he struck in his essay in The Post, in which he wrote that Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency \u201cmade a deep descent in December\u201d after his abrupt announcement that he would withdraw American troops from Syria, and the departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.Mr. Romney got a taste of how lonely it can be in Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican Party to speak out against the president, as few lawmakers sided with their new colleague Wednesday and one senator even set up a conference call with reporters to criticize him. It was a revealing illustration of the loyalty Mr. Trump still commands even as he enters a perilous stretch of his presidency.But if Mr. Romney later seemed as if he wanted to ease away from his essay\u2019s condemnation, Mr. Trump was, at least by his standards, somewhat muted in his counterattack against the man he once belittled for walking \u201clike a penguin.\u201dEarly on Wednesday, Mr. Trump noted that the former Massachusetts governor lost his 2012 presidential bid. \u201cI won big, and he didn\u2019t,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cHe should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!\u201dAnd when addressing reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon, the president said that if Mr. Romney had been as harsh on former President Barack Obama in their campaign, \u201che would have won the election.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s loyalists responded more ferociously, and out in front was Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, who is also Mr. Romney\u2019s niece.\u201cFor an incoming Republican freshman senator to attack @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the Democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive,\u201d Ms. McDaniel wrote about her uncle on Twitter.Her attack stunned other members of Mr. Romney\u2019s family, with one suggesting she would regret putting her political loyalties over her family.But Mr. Romney declined to respond in kind to her, and the matter only illustrated how awkward this moment is for all parties.This week\u2019s contretemps were just the latest turn in an on-and-off political relationship dating back to Mr. Trump\u2019s 2012 endorsement of Mr. Romney at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.Mr. Romney, then a candidate for the presidency, and his wife, Ann, were not thrilled about having to submit to Mr. Trump, who relished the attention but plainly did not have a natural connection with Mr. Romney.Four years later it was Mr. Trump on the ballot, and Mr. Romney unleashed a blistering attack on his character, calling him \u201ca fraud,\u201d prompting Mr. Trump to call him \u201ca choker.\u201dBut after Mr. Trump won, the two appeared to reach a d\u00e9tente and even discussed Mr. Romney\u2019s taking the secretary of state job over a dinner of frog legs  at the Jean-Georges restaurant in Manhattan.ImageRonna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee who is also Mr. Romney\u2019s niece, has defended Mr. Trump against her uncle\u2019s critiques.CreditJeff Roberson/Associated PressSince then, the two have maintained a relative peace, with Mr. Trump endorsing Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign for the Senate last year and Mr. Romney only intermittently confronting the president.But at a moment when a series of investigations have engulfed the White House and Democrats are about to take control of the House, Mr. Romney\u2019s broadside this week was a reminder to Mr. Trump that one of his earliest and loudest Republican critics will soon have a high-profile platform in Washington.Sensing the makings of a primary threat to the president, some of his most ardent backers on the Republican National Committee began making the case that the party\u2019s rules be changed to ensure Mr. Trump\u2019s renomination in 2020.Calling Mr. Romney\u2019s attack \u201ccalculated political treachery,\u201d Jevon Williams, the national committeeman from the Virgin Islands, wrote in an email to other members of the R.N.C. that the party should move to protect Mr. Trump by amending party rules to make it harder for a challenger to have his name placed in nomination at the Republicans\u2019 2020 convention.And, Mr. Williams wrote, the party should use its winter meeting this month to pass a resolution endorsing Mr. Trump and declaring him \u201cthe presumptive nominee in 2020.\u201dIn the CNN interview, Mr. Romney said, \u201cI\u2019m not running again.\u201dBut even if he just acts as an occasional critic of the president, Mr. Romney will run into resistance.Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, viewing Mr. Romney\u2019s offensive as an opening to nurture his ties with the media-obsessed Mr. Trump, scheduled an afternoon conference call with reporters to target his soon-to-be colleague.\u201cI just don\u2019t think the president deserves to have a new senator coming in attacking his character,\u201d said Mr. Paul, accusing Mr. Romney of acting \u201cholier than thou.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s senior aides were less exercised about Mr. Romney\u2019s attack, with one of them noting with pleasure that the president was relatively restrained \u2014 and that an overreaction would only reinforce Mr. Romney\u2019s criticism.But White House officials were still irritated with Mr. Romney, pointedly noting that they only got a brief heads-up that the essay was coming. It was Ms. McDaniel who informed them about the column, according to a senior White House aide.Mr. Romney\u2019s allies said part of the purpose of the column was to give him a document that he can point back to, as an evergreen statement of his general thinking about Mr. Trump, rather than offering critiques in response to every presidential tweet.For his part, though, Mr. Trump has been warily eyeing the arrival of Mr. Romney since well before the essay in The Post.Last fall, Mr. Trump, mindful that Mr. Romney would move quickly to assert himself, asked Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, not to give Mr. Romney a leadership platform. A Republican familiar with the discussion said that Mr. Trump specifically wanted to keep Mr. Romney away from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the party\u2019s campaign arm in Senate races.But even if Mr. Romney gets no formal title with Senate Republicans, Trump aides worry that Mr. Romney\u2019s extensive fund-raising network will make it hard for the Republican campaign committee to resist making use of him in the 2020 election cycle.The notion of installing Mr. Romney at the campaign committee was a pet project of his longtime family friend and adviser Spencer Zwick, who raised the idea with donors as a way of carving out a leadership role as an unusually prominent freshman lawmaker.The idea drew at least mild interest from Mrs. Romney, but Mr. Romney was less intrigued and viewed it as a nonstarter for practical reasons, two people briefed on the conversations said. The position is effectively a fund-raising assignment, and another senator, Todd Young of Indiana, got the job.But operating in a formal capacity as a partisan functionary would most likely have required Mr. Romney to stay silent about his disagreements with Mr. Trump, lest he put Republican candidates in the position of having to pick sides between the two men \u2014 the sitting president and the best-known Republican senator \u2014 on a routine basis.Republican leaders believe that scenario may come to pass even without giving Mr. Romney an official leadership role, as he discovers the enormous megaphone available to him in the halls of CongressBut Mr. Romney said Wednesday that he would not seek to torment Mr. Trump.\u201cJust doing things symbolically that hurt somebody that you\u2019re opposed to doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "Sexism Claims From Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 Run: Paid Less, Treated Worse", "category": "Politics", "id": "be61815d-c384-477f-b9c4-86da737fcf94", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-sexism.html", "publishdate": 20190102, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/02/us/politics/02berniesanders1/merlin_147434064_7ac4b167-43c6-4c3d-b83b-3cf3841182e3-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "In February 2016, Giulianna Di Lauro, a Latino outreach strategist for Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential operation, complained to her supervisor that she had been harassed by a campaign surrogate whom she drove to events ahead of the Democratic primary in Nevada.She said the surrogate told her she had \u201cbeautiful curly hair\u201d and asked if he could touch it, Ms. Di Lauro said in an interview. Thinking he would just touch a strand, she consented. But she said that he ran his hand through her hair in a \u201csexual way\u201d and continued to grab, touch and \u201cpush my boundaries\u201d for the rest of the day.\u201cI just wanted to be done with it so badly,\u201d she said.When she reported the incident to Bill Velazquez, a manager on the Latino outreach team, he told her, \u201cI bet you would have liked it if he were younger,\u201d according to her account and another woman who witnessed the exchange. Then he laughed.Accounts like Ms. Di Lauro\u2019s \u2014 describing episodes of sexual harassment and demeaning treatment as well as pay disparity in Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign \u2014 have circulated in recent weeks in emails, online comments and private discussions among former supporters. Now, as the Vermont senator tries to build support for a second run at the White House, his perceived failure to address this issue has damaged his progressive bona fides, delegates and nearly a dozen former state and national staff members said in interviews over the last month.And it has raised questions among them about whether he can adequately fight for the interests of women, who have increasingly defined the Democratic Party in the Trump era, if he runs again for the presidential nomination in 2020.The former staff members said complaints about mistreatment and pay disparity during and just after the campaign reached some senior leaders of the operation.In an interview Wednesday night on CNN, Mr. Sanders said he was proud of his 2016 campaign and attributed any missteps with staff members to the explosive growth that was sometimes overwhelming. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you that we did everything right, in terms of human resources,\u201d he told Anderson Cooper.\u201cI certainly apologize to any woman who felt she was not treated appropriately, and of course if I run we will do better the next time,\u201d he said.Asked if he knew about the staff complaints, he said, \u201cI was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case.\u201dSome women said the fledgling 2016 campaign was disorganized and decentralized, which made it hard to know whom to turn to in the case of mistreatment.\u201cI did experience sexual harassment during the campaign, and there was no one who would or could help,\u201d said Samantha Davis, the former director of operations in Texas and New York, who also worked on the campaign\u2019s advance team. She said that her supervisor marginalized her after she declined an invitation to his hotel room.In interviews, women told of makeshift living accommodations on the road, where they were asked to sleep in rooms along with male co-workers they didn\u2019t know. Women who had access to salary records were taken aback to learn that some female staff members made thousands of dollars less than their male counterparts.Two delegates who supported Mr. Sanders two years ago recently told his staff that he can\u2019t run for president again without addressing the sexism they believe surfaced in his last campaign.\u201cThere was an entire wave of rotten sexual harassment that seemingly was never dealt with,\u201d one of the delegates wrote in a December email, obtained by The New York Times, to a Sanders political strategist.Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign manager and currently a top adviser, said in an email that \u201canybody who committed harassment on the campaign would not be asked back\u201d and expressed regret for the operation\u2019s shortcomings.\u201cWas it too male? Yes. Was it too white? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cWould this be a priority to remedy on any future campaign? Definitely, and we share deeply in the urgency for all of us to make change. In 2016, as the size of our campaign exploded, we made efforts to make it a positive experience for people. That there was a failure pains me very much.\u201dFriends of Bernie Sanders, the senator\u2019s campaign committee, said in a response to questions from The Times that there were a number of actions taken during the 2016 campaign regarding harassment and sexism, including employee counseling and a campaign-wide review to standardize pay, and that there was a set of procedures and guidelines for workplace conduct that staff members were required to read. It also said it had developed a new harassment policy for Mr. Sanders\u2019s Senate campaign last year.Disenchanted supportersAllegations of sexism surfaced during Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign in 2016, when many of his male fans were derogatorily dubbed \u201cBernie Bros\u201d for their aggressive online attacks against female reporters and supporters of Hillary Clinton. But they did not overshadow the electrifying nature of his insurgent challenge.Circumstances have changed since then. Mr. Sanders is no longer an outsider, but an established leader who will be held to a higher standard. And regarding the treatment of women, he must now grapple with the effects of the #MeToo movement.Political campaigns can be grueling experiences for both the women and men involved. But some involved said they considered the treatment of women on the Sanders campaign especially upsetting because the senator positioned himself as a champion of progressive ideals and equality, according to interviews and messages shared on Facebook.\u201cI don\u2019t think he has to be the vehicle or the platform for the movement that emerged from his campaign,\u201d said Sarah Slamen, who worked for the campaign in Texas, was the state coordinator in Louisiana and helped build out Our Revolution, a progressive organization born from Mr. Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign.\u201cDo you know how hard that is for me to say after working so hard for him?\u201d she said.Ms. Slamen quit the organization at the end of 2016 after she said she was berated by a male member of the Our Revolution steering committee for suggesting an organizing plan. In emails reviewed by The Times, she raised issues about sexist behavior with committee members who saw the incident and Our Revolution\u2019s national board of directors. She said she received no reassurance that anything would change.In recent weeks, a Facebook group for campaign alumni has become a sounding board for complaints about harassment, lewd comments and gender discrimination. Some alumni have requested a meeting with the senator and his campaign leadership team to address the \u201coverall toxic atmosphere of the 2016 campaign,\u201d according to a screenshot of a post viewed by The Times. Politico first reported on the request.ImageMr. Sanders\u2019s circumstances have changed since his insurgent 2016 campaign. He is no longer the outsider, but an established leader held to a higher standard.CreditKathryn Gamble for The New York TimesMs. Di Lauro, the former strategist in Nevada, was emphatic in her own Facebook posts. \u201cI have to speak up about this now because I hope it will be of service to the next Sanders campaign,\u201d she wrote on Dec. 7.In her interview with The Times, Ms. Di Lauro said she told several people who were high up in the campaign, including Rich Pelletier, who served as national field director, about her encounter in Nevada with the surrogate, a Mexican game show host named Marco Antonio Regil. But she felt she was not taken seriously by the campaign.\u201cIt was as if nothing happened,\u201d she said.Masha Mendieta, who was also on the Latino outreach team and who was with Ms. Di Lauro when she spoke with Mr. Velazquez about the incident, confirmed his comments.Mr. Velazquez said he does not recall making the flippant remark to Ms. Di Lauro and that he took her complaint seriously. He said he assigned two women to accompany the surrogate, and he checked in with them to make sure there were no problems.Mr. Regil said through his agent that he was honored to be a campaign surrogate for Mr. Sanders. \u201cI sincerely apologize for any interactions or behavior on my part that could\u2019ve made anyone feel uncomfortable,\u201d he said.Mr. Velasquez said he also told his boss, Arturo Carmona, another manager on the Latino outreach team and deputy national political director, about what had happened and followed up with a memo to Mr. Carmona two weeks later, detailing the incident in an email and saying that he believed Ms. Di Lauro.Mr. Carmona said in an email to The Times that, after Mr. Velazquez notified him about the incident, he reported it to Mr. Pelletier.The senator\u2019s campaign committee, in its responses to The Times, said no member of the leadership above Mr. Pelletier was aware of the incident until after the campaign.The committee said managers in some cases had not received appropriate training. \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, the surprise explosion of the campaign resulted in there being less-than-ideal training infrastructure,\u201d it said.Mr. Pelletier did not respond to phone messages and emails seeking comment.Pay disparity became another source of frustration among some women, according to former staff members, especially given that labor was one of the senator\u2019s signature issues. During his campaign, Mr. Sanders earned kudos for paying his interns, a relatively unheard-of practice.Some former staff members said there was little pay transparency, and employees often negotiated their own salaries \u2014 practices that tend to favor men, who often feel more comfortable requesting higher compensation packages.Ms. Davis, the former state director, said that she was originally paid about $2,400 a month as a senior staff member and saw in the campaign\u2019s records that a younger man who was originally supposed to report to her made $5,000 a month. She said that she brought the issue to the campaign\u2019s chief operating officer, who adjusted her salary to achieve parity.\u201cI helped at least a dozen women request raises so that they would be paid on par with their male peers,\u201d Ms. Davis said.The senator\u2019s campaign committee acknowledged that there were pay disparities but said salaries were based on experience or the nature of the job and \u201cnever determined based on any consideration of an individual\u2019s gender or of any other personal characteristic.\u2019\u2019During the campaign, the committee said, it conducted a review to try to standardize pay across the states and within headquarters.Treated like \u2018personal assistants\u2019Frustration among campaign alumni boiled over in recent weeks when Mr. Carmona, the deputy national political director and a divisive figure on the 2016 campaign, appeared smiling in a photograph in early December with Mr. Sanders\u2019s wife, Jane, at a symposium hosted by her organization, the Sanders Institute.In 2017, when Mr. Carmona was running for Congress, Ms. Mendieta, the woman who worked with Ms. Di Lauro, came forward with allegations that Mr. Carmona had demeaned women during the 2016 campaign. Ms. Mendieta said in a March 2017 post on Medium that Mr. Carmona treated female staffers \u201clike his personal assistants fetching things for him and doing his errands.\u201dOther women backed up Ms. Mendieta\u2019s allegations, and a letter signed by dozens of former campaign staffers and surrogates was circulated urging progressives to withdraw their endorsements of Mr. Carmona. (He lost his special election primary bid in 2017.)In an interview, Ms. Mendieta said that she complained multiple times to Mr. Velazquez and Mr. Pelletier about Mr. Carmona and was repeatedly ignored, at one point being told by Mr. Velazquez that she should forgive Mr. Carmona\u2019s behavior because he was \u201cmacho.\u201dMr. Velazquez said that he did not remember making that remark or anything like it.Ms. Mendieta was among the Latino outreach team members who she said were expected to stay in a run-down house in Chicago in March 2016. When she arrived, she said she was told she was supposed to sleep in a room with three men she did not know.\u201cI was shaking with fear,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cLiterally, I remember thinking to myself, \u2018What am I going to do?\u2019\u201d She said she reported the incident to Mr. Pelletier.The campaign committee said that \u201cthe challenge of finding staffer housing is one that plagues every large campaign.\u201d It said it knew of one instance that was brought to the attention of senior leaders, including Mr. Weaver, the campaign manager, and that both Mr. Weaver and the chief operating officer \u201cordered that staff never be housed in coed hotel rooms again.\u201dSome weeks later, Ms. Mendieta and other members of the Latino outreach team shared their concerns about Mr. Carmona and Mr. Velazquez during a conference call with Mr. Pelletier, Ms. Mendieta said.  The Times has reviewed an email scheduling the call, and another staff member who participated confirmed the substance of the discussion.Mr. Carmona was promoted out of the Latino outreach group during the campaign and named a deputy national political director.Mr. Carmona, in an email, denied the allegations that he was demeaning and said, \u201cAll sexual harassment and issues of discrimination should be taken seriously and investigated thoroughly.\u201d"}, {"title": "E.C.B.

Among policymakers and economists looking for signs of the next crisis, Italy and its heavily indebted banks have been a source of concern for years. And the policies and statements of the populist government in Rome have recently added to the woes of Italy\u2019s banks, and by extension, the whole economy.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bank large enough to cause systemic crisis,\u201d said Lorenzo Codogno, a former chief economist at Italy\u2019s treasury who operates LC Macro Advisors, a consultancy in London. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cwe have seen that even small banks can cause huge problems.\u201d\u201cThe current government is not prepared for a full-fledged banking crisis,\u201d Mr. Codogno said.The action by Europe\u2019s central bank on Wednesday reassured investors so far that the vulnerabilities of Banca Carige, the 10th-largest lender in Italy, would not provoke a broader crisis.The central bank appointed a six-person team to manage Banca Carige, which serves the region around Genoa, after most of the bank\u2019s board of directors resigned following the collapse of efforts to raise fresh capital. It was the first time the European Central Bank has appointed new leadership for a commercial bank since it acquired expanded powers in 2014 to supervise lenders.The central bank\u2019s intervention was absorbed with relative calm by financial markets. The Euro Stoxx Banks index fell about 2 percent on a day when most stocks were down.But the question of who will buy Banca Carige \u2014 and whether shareholders will be responsible for some of its debt \u2014 is likely to heighten tensions between the central bank and Italy\u2019s coalition government.Finding a buyer will be difficult. If the bank\u2019s troubles deepen, the central bank, under European rules, would be obliged to make shareholders and creditors bear some of the losses.That could put the central bank at odds with the government in Rome. The coalition of the far-right League and the populist Five Star Movement has so far tried to defend the interests of shareholders and bondholders, who are often middle-class Italians.Banca Carige could also create political conflict in Brussels. Sven Giegold, a member of the European Parliament who speaks for the Green faction on financial issues, called for an investigation of whether earlier attempts to rescue Banca Carige violated European Union rules on state aid.Mr. Giegold said in a statement Wednesday that other Italian banks last year were strong-armed into providing Banca Carige with fresh capital, which proved to be inadequate.\u201cThe coordinated rescue now looks like a waste of money by the already weakened Italian banking system,\u201d Mr. Giegold said.Almost all Italian banks have been struggling since the 2008 financial crisis. Monte dei Paschi di Siena, considered the world\u2019s oldest bank, required an 8.3 billion euro, or $9.4 billion, rescue in 2017 after years of mismanagement, a surge in bad loans and allegations that top managers conspired to hide the bank\u2019s financial straits.The challenges facing the banks \u2014 and Italy\u2019s economy \u2014 have increased since the populist government took power in June.Plans in Rome to reverse cuts in pensions and give cash to poor people undercut investors\u2019 confidence in the government\u2019s ability to repay the national debt. As a result, investors have demanded higher interest rates on Italian government bonds.The instability has been poison for Italian banks because the rates on government bonds act as a benchmark for all types of credit. Banks have had to borrow at far higher rates than banks in other European countries.Banca Carige, which has roots going back to the time of Christopher Columbus, is paying an astronomical 16 percent annual interest on recently issued bonds.The yields on Italian bonds have tempered since last month when the government backed down in a confrontation with the European Commission over its spending plan, which would have broken European Union rules on debt limits. That has eased the pressure on banks.But the Italian economy has never fully recovered from 2008. Businesses went bankrupt then, and many borrowers lost their jobs or are earning far less.For Banca Carige, that meant borrowers were behind in payments or not making payments at all. More than a quarter of Banca Carige\u2019s outstanding loans are considered nonperforming.Economists and business managers expect the economy to worsen in 2019, increasing stress on banks. A survey of purchasing managers at Italian manufacturing companies published Wednesday by IHS Markit, a research firm, showed that business conditions deteriorated in December, and \u201cthere appears little sense of optimism that the current soft patch will come to an end in the near future.\u201dConfidence about the future was at its lowest in six years, the survey found. \u201cThe outlook for 2019 is not encouraging,\u201d Rosie Colthorpe, an analyst at Oxford Economics, said in a note to clients Wednesday.At Banca Carige, temporary managers installed by the European Central Bank are expected to try to sell the institution. The bank is not considered insolvent, although it lost \u20ac189 million, or $215 million, during the first nine months of 2018 on revenue of \u20ac373 million.The central bank\u2019s intervention was prompted by the resignation Wednesday of a majority of Banca Carige\u2019s board of directors. They quit after the bank\u2019s largest shareholders, members of the wealthy Malacalza family, declined last month to support plans to raise more capital.The temporary administrators appointed by the central bank Wednesday include the existing chief executive, Fabio Innocenzi, and the chairman, Pietro Modiano. Both had joined the bank recently. They will have more powers as central bank appointees than they would as regular managers, including the right to set the agenda for shareholders\u2019 meetings.\u201cThe decision to impose temporary administration is an early intervention measure aimed at ensuring continuity and pursuing the objectives of a strategic plan,\u201d the European Central Bank said in a statement."}, {"title": "Apple Cuts Revenue Forecast Because of Slow iPhone Sales in China", "category": "Business", "id": "67ead72b-4b7e-4b03-883f-8019f4950d2d", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/technology/apple-revenue-decline-china.html", "publishdate": 20190102, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/business/03APPLE-promo2/03APPLE-promo2-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years on Wednesday because of poor iPhone sales in China, an unexpected development that underscored the slowing of China\u2019s economy and raised fears of further turmoil in global markets.Apple\u2019s surprise announcement was the clearest confirmation yet that the Chinese economy is in serious trouble. Beijing\u2019s effort last spring to clamp down on credit, which sparked a slowdown, and an intensifying trade war with the United States have unnerved consumers and businesspeople alike.\u201cApple is a bellwether,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe iPhone is something that everyone knows and buys, and if people aren\u2019t buying it, then that\u2019s a pretty good sign they\u2019re having a hard time.\u201dIt is not clear whether this is a problem particular to Apple or whether China\u2019s slowing economy will affect other American companies, especially the tech giants and Detroit automakers. Either way, investors are bound to grow nervous, especially after the stock market\u2019s recent gyrations. Tech stocks, which drove much of the bull market of the past few years, have become a drag on it.With more than 40 stores and hundreds of millions of iPhones sold in the country, few American companies have been as successful as Apple in China \u2014 or have as much to lose. China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market, with nearly $52 billion in sales in the company\u2019s most recent fiscal year, mostly from iPhone sales.The company said it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Saturday, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion. That would be a nearly 5 percent decline from the same quarter a year ago.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said the sales decline in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan would exceed the $4.3 billion overall drop in revenue.\u201cWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China,\u201d Mr. Cook said in a letter to investors. \u201cWe believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.\u201dApple\u2019s revenue warnings sent its shares down more than 7 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday evening, dropping its market value to less than $700 billion. Apple had become the first company to surpass a $1 trillion valuation in August.Its declining share pricehad a ripple effect. Asian markets fell Thursday, and Wall Street opened lower. Apple\u2019s shares dropped by more than 9 percent to start trading Thursday.[See how investors reacted to Apple\u2019s news.]Mr. Cook has for years navigated the difficult politics of China, including its tightening controls over the internet, but the Trump administration\u2019s tougher stance on the country is posing a challenge.The iPhone was exempt from the first round of tariffs on products built in China. But Mr. Cook said Wednesday that trade tensions and accompanying volatility in global markets had weighed on Chinese consumers and Apple\u2019s profits.The company\u2019s other revenue sources, including iPad, Mac and software sales, together increased nearly 19 percent in the quarter. In the United States and other developed markets like Germany and South Korea, Apple said, it actually had record revenues. The company recently said it would end a longtime custom and no longer break out unit sales of iPhones, a change that rattled investors.While Apple posted roughly flat global sales growth of the iPhone in the third quarter, Chinese rival Huawei jumped 33 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the market research firm Counterpoint. The figures helped Huawei maintain its status as the second-largest smartphone maker in the world behind Samsung, which posted a 13 percent fall in sales in the same quarter.Huawei has grown despite the China slowdown, as the company has looked to other markets. In the third quarter, its sales rose 13 percent in China but 60 percent outside the country.Finding signs of nervousness about spending in China is not hard, especially among the high-end consumers who dominate the purchase of Apple\u2019s costly phones and laptops, which are far more expensive than local brands.Many expensive restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai seemed almost empty in early December. Room rates at five-star hotels in both cities, which oscillate continuously in internet pricing these days based on demand, suddenly tumbled in early December, and executive lounges emptied.Car sales fell in September, October and November by record percentages from a year earlier, with each month worse than the last. Car executives say early information shows December was a terrible month for sales as well. Automakers like General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen all rely heavily on the Chinese market and have reported nose-dives in their sales in recent months.Unsold apartments are clogging the country\u2019s real estate market and eroding prices. That is a big threat to China\u2019s economic growth in the new year because the frenzied construction and outfitting of new homes has accounted for a quarter or more of economic output in recent years, outshining even exports.There are broader signs of economic worry. Government and private surveys that were released in the past week show that purchasing managers in China expect the economy to worsen considerably. New orders are down, and exports are faltering.\u201cThe worst is yet to come,\u201d Mizuho Securities said in a research report on Monday.The Beijing leadership has not tried to fan anti-American sentiment in the trade war with the Trump administration. Indeed, ever since President Xi Jinping of China reached a temporary truce with President Trump on Dec. 1 in Buenos Aires, Chinese state media has gone out of its way to avoid criticizing the United States.But tensions continue to grow. Canada\u2019s recent detention of the chief financial officer of Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, on an American warrant has led to fears of retaliation against American companies or executives. Ms. Meng is the daughter of the company\u2019s founder.The Trump administration has so far avoided imposing tariffs on smartphones from China. But if that happens, Apple, with its almost complete dependence on factories in mainland China, could find itself at a disadvantage to its global archrival, Samsung, which makes its phones in a wider variety of countries.\u201cIf people aren\u2019t buying iPhones, they\u2019re probably not buying everything else,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cIt symbolizes how deep China\u2019s economic problems are, and we can connect the dots right back to the trade war.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: What Could Go Wrong in 2019?

Welcome to the first working day of the new year. Want this by email? Sign up here.Hope springs eternal on Wall Street. But should it?Last year was an unexpectedly bad year for the stock market. But Wall Street\u2019s top stock pickers are expecting gains in 2019. Still, there is plenty that could go wrong and upend those forecasts, the NYT\u2019s Peter Eavis and Guilbert Gates write.Here\u2019s a look:Borrowing costs: The Fed increased its target rate four times in 2018, and fears that the central bank would raise interest rates too much and send a chill through the American economy weighed heavily on stocks in 2018. If investors don\u2019t see signs that the economy is growing steadily, they could hang on the Fed\u2019s every move, and monetary policy meeting, this year.President Trump: Investors were mostly tolerant in early 2108 of Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable declarations on Twitter. But as the trade war with China escalated, his proclamations began to make investors jumpy. And it wasn\u2019t just the tweets about China: The president also roiled the markets with criticism of the Fed. Mr. Trump is now the top concern that keeps investors up at night.Global growth: Large overseas economies \u2014 China, Japan and the European Union \u2014 appear to be taking a turn for the worse. Growth may accelerate if trade agreements are forged in 2019. But the problems could run deeper. China\u2019s methods for pulling itself out of an economic rut  are probably not as effective as they once were, and Europe could be hit hard if Britain crashes out of the European Union.Tech stocks: Companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Netflix helped push the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to records. But when some those companies dipped, they dragged the indexes down with them. The market\u2019s fate depends in large part on whether investors fall back in love with large technology companies.What has to go right? The U.S. economy needs to grow strongly, the Fed needs to tread a delicate middle ground, the trade war needs to wind down, and the economies of Europe and China need to stabilize.More on markets: Retail investors are trying to hold on despite the intense volatility. As the great unwind continues, markets are at increased risk of experiencing \u201cdoom loops.\u201d Analysts have been trimming their earnings forecasts since September, and investors are worried the outlook for companies will deteriorate further.Asian markets off to a discouraging startNew data showing weakening factory activity in China is amplifying concerns about the health of the global economy and driving down stocks across Asia.\u2022 The Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index for China sank last month to 49.7, falling below the 50 mark that represents contraction for the first time since May 2017. The slide, reported today, followed similarly gloomy results on Monday from the Chinese government. The sense of impending malaise spread elsewhere in Asia, with production activity in Malaysia and Taiwan shrinking to its slowest pace in years.\u2022 The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong responded by falling nearly 2.8 percent on the first trading day of 2019. The Shanghai composite index slipped 1.15 percent. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 was down 1.6 percent. S&P futures also took a hit.\u2022 Stocks have been shaky as investors fret about trade tensions between China and the U.S., the Fed\u2019s position on interest rates, and intensifying predictions of waning economic growth around the world.\u2022 Employees at Baidu received a letter today from Robin Li, the chief executive of the Chinese technology company, warning that \u201cwinter is coming.\u201d In the note, reported by the South China Morning Post, Mr. Li wrote that economic restructuring was \u201cas cold and real as winter to every company.\u201d____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________ImageRobert LighthizerCreditKevin Lamarque/ReutersBehind U.S. strategy in trade talks with ChinaWith talks between China and the United States set to begin this week in Beijing, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, faces the assignment of a lifetime: redefining the trade relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies by March 2.But first, writes Glenn Thrush in the NYT, \u201cMr. Lighthizer will need to keep a mercurial president from wavering in the face of queasy financial markets, which have suffered their steepest annual decline since 2008. Despite his declaration that trade wars are \u2018easy to win\u2019 and his recent boast that he is a \u2018Tariff Man,\u2019 Mr. Trump is increasingly eager to reach a deal that will help calm the markets, which he views as a political electrocardiogram of his presidency.\u201dAfter 40 years of dealing with China and watching its government dangle promises that do not materialize, Mr. Lighthizer remains deeply skeptical of Beijing and has warned Mr. Trump that the United States may need to exert more pressure through additional tariffs to win true concessions.Big plans for Big TechSilicon Valley was embattled in 2018. With lawmakers saying Big Tech has too much power and regulation looming, it might seem like a good time for companies like Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook to lie low. That is not the path they are taking, writes the NYT\u2019s David Streitfeld. In fact, Big Tech\u2019s dizzying expansion is barely getting started.Tech companies are competing to own the cloud and become, in essence, the internet\u2019s landlord. Google made a deal in 2017 to reimagine a chunk of waterfront Toronto from the ground up. Amazon is adding warehouses in rural areas to provide urban dwellers with everything they need to stay home. For those who venture out, driverless cars will be operated by Big Tech. And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence.To accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees. Google is bulking up in New York and Amazon is planning satellite offices in New York and Washington. Even in Silicon Valley, the boom is accelerating. Last spring Facebook leased one million square feet in Sunnyvale, Calif., for its fast-growing community operations team.More on tech: Mark Zuckerberg admits in a New Year\u2019s post that he is facing an uphill battle to fix Facebook. And 2019 is tech\u2019s chance to make it right.ImageA facial recognition system developed in the U.S.CreditKristian Thacker for The New York TimesA global turf war over A.I.The Commerce Department is mulling export restrictions on artificial intelligence, citing the technology\u2019s importance to national security. But Silicon Valley insiders say the potential rules could short-circuit U.S. competitiveness in an industry built largely by Americans, reports the NYT\u2019s Cade Metz.The news: In November, the U.S. government included computer vision, speech recognition and other artificial intelligence categories on a list of \u201cemerging and foundational technologies\u201d being considered for export restrictions. The rules could limit or block exports to countries such as China, whose tactics toward American technology have been criticized by the Trump administration as bullying or illegal.Why it matters: Tech experts are nervous that restrictions could stifle American innovation in the field while increasing development of A.I. technology abroad, especially in Asia.

Like many young people in China, the 24-year-old recent college graduate knew little about the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. He had never heard of China\u2019s most famous dissident, Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate who died in custody two years ago.Now, after training, he knows what to look for \u2014 and what to block. He spends his hours scanning online content on behalf of Chinese media companies looking for anything that will provoke the government\u2019s wrath. He knows how to spot code words that obliquely refer to Chinese leaders and scandals, or the memes that touch on subjects the Chinese government doesn\u2019t want people to read about.Mr. Li, who still has traces of youthful acne on his face, takes his job seriously. \u201cIt helps cleanse the online environment,\u201d he said. For Chinese companies, staying on the safe side of government censors is a matter of life and death. Adding to the burden, the authorities demand that companies censor themselves, spurring them to hire thousands of people to police content. That in turn has created a growing and lucrative new industry: censorship factories.Mr. Li works for Beyondsoft, a Beijing-based tech services company that, among other businesses, takes on the censorship burden for other companies. He works in its office in the city of Chengdu. In the heart of a high-tech industrial area, the space is bright and new enough that it resembles the offices of well-funded start-ups in tech centers like Beijing and Shenzhen. It recently moved to the space because customers complained that its previous office was too cramped to allow employees to do their best work.\u201cMissing one beat could cause a serious political mistake,\u201d said Yang Xiao, head of Beyondsoft\u2019s internet service business, including content reviewing. (Beyondsoft declined to disclose which Chinese media or online companies it works for, citing confidentiality.)China has built the world\u2019s most extensive and sophisticated online censorship system. It grew even stronger under President Xi Jinping, who wants the internet to play a greater role in strengthening the Communist Party\u2019s hold on society. More content is considered sensitive. Punishments are getting more severe. Once circumspect about its controls, China now preaches a vision of a government-supervised internet that has surprising resonance in other countries. Even traditional bastions of free expression like Western Europe and the United States are considering their own digital limits. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have said that they would hire thousands more people to better keep a handle on their content. Workers like Mr. Li show the extremes of that approach \u2014 one that controls what more than 800 million internet users in China see every day.Beyondsoft employs over 4,000 workers like Mr. Li at its content reviewing factories. That is up from about 200 in 2016. They review and censor content day and night.\u201cWe\u2019re the Foxconn in the data industry,\u201d said Mr. Yang, comparing his firm to the biggest contract manufacturer that makes iPhones and other products for Apple.Many online media companies have their own internal content review teams, sometimes numbering in the thousands. They are exploring ways to get artificial intelligence to do the work. The head of the A.I. lab at a major online media company, who asked for anonymity because the subject is sensitive, said the company had 120 machine learning models. But success is spotty. Users can easily fool algorithms. \u201cThe A.I. machines are intelligent, but they aren\u2019t as clever as human brains,\u201d Mr. Li said. \u201cThey miss a lot of things when reviewing content.\u201dBeyondsoft has a team of 160 people in Chengdu working four shifts a day to review potentially politically sensitive content on a news aggregating app. For the same app, Beyondsoft has another team in the western city of Xi\u2019an reviewing potentially vulgar or profane content. Like the rest of the world, China\u2019s internet is rife with pornography and other material that many users might find offensive. In the Chengdu office, workers must put their smartphones in hallway lockers. They can\u2019t take screenshots or send any information from their computers.The workers are almost all college graduates in their 20s. They are often unaware of, or indifferent to, politics. In China, many parents and teachers tell the young that caring about politics leads only to trouble.To overcome that, Mr. Yang and his colleagues developed a sophisticated training system. New hires start with weeklong \u201ctheory\u201d training, during which senior employees teach them the sensitive information that they didn\u2019t know before. \u201cMy office is next to the big training room,\u201d Mr. Yang said. \u201cI often hear the surprised sounds of \u2018Ah, ah, ah.\u2019\u201d \u201cThey didn\u2019t know things like June 4,\u201d he added, referring to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. \u201cThey really didn\u2019t know.\u201dBeyondsoft has developed an extensive database based on such information that Mr. Yang calls one of its \u201ccore competencies.\u201d It also uses anti-censorship software to regularly visit what it calls anti-revolutionary websites that are blocked by the Chinese government. It then updates the database.New employees study the database much like preparing for college entrance exams. After two weeks, they have to pass a test.The screen saver on each computer is the same: photos and names of current and past members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the Communist Party\u2019s top leadership. Workers must memorize those faces: Only government-owned websites and specially approved political blogs \u2014 a group on what\u2019s called a whitelist \u2014 are allowed to post photos of top leaders.Workers are briefed at the beginning of their shift on the newest censoring instructions sent by clients, which the clients themselves receive from government censors. Workers then must answer about 10 questions designed to test their memory. The results of the exam affect the workers\u2019 pay.One question on a recent Friday: Which one of the following names is the daughter of Li Peng, China\u2019s former premier? The correct answer is Li Xiaolin, a longtime target of online ridicule for her expensive fashion taste and for being one of many children of senior officials who come into high positions or wealth. That\u2019s a relatively easy one. A tougher test is parsing the roundabout ways that China\u2019s internet users evade stringent censorship to talk about current affairs. Take, for example, a Hong Kong news site\u2019s 2017 commentary that compared the six Chinese leaders since Mao Zedong to emperors during the Han dynasty. Some Chinese users started using the emperors\u2019 names when referring to the leaders. Beyondsoft\u2019s workers have to know which emperor\u2019s name is associated with which leader. Then there are the photos of an empty chair. They refer to Mr. Liu, the Nobel laureate, who wasn\u2019t allowed to leave China to attend the award ceremony and was represented by an empty chair. References to George Orwell\u2019s novel \u201c1984\u201d are also forbidden. Beyondsoft\u2019s software trawls through web pages and marks potentially offensive words in different colors. If a page is full of color-coded words, it usually requires a closer look, according to the executives. If there are only one or two, it\u2019s pretty safe to let it pass.According to Beyondsoft\u2019s website, its content monitoring service, called Rainbow Shield, has compiled over 100,000 basic sensitive words and over three million derivative words. Politically sensitive words make up one-third of the total, followed by words related to pornography, prostitution, gambling and knives.Workers like Mr. Li make $350 to $500 a month, about average pay in Chengdu. Each worker is expected to review 1,000 to 2,000 articles during a shift. Articles uploaded to the news app must be approved or rejected within an hour. Unlike Foxconn workers, they don\u2019t work much overtime because longer hours could hurt accuracy, said Mr. Yang, the executive.It\u2019s easy to make mistakes. One article about Peng Liyuan, China\u2019s first lady, mistakenly used the photo of a famous singer rumored to be linked to another leader. It was caught by someone else before it went out, Mr. Yang said.Mr. Li, the young censor, said the worst mistakes were almost all related to senior leaders. He once missed a tiny photo of Mr. Xi on a website not on the whitelist because he was tired. He still kicks himself for it.When asked whether he had shared with family and friends what he learned at work, such as the Tiananmen crackdown, Mr. Li vehemently said no.\u201cThis information is not for people outside to know,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce many people know about it, it could generate rumors.\u201dBut the crackdown was history. It wasn\u2019t a rumor. How would he reconcile that? \u201cFor certain things,\u201d he said, \u201cone just has to obey the rules.\u201d"}, {"title": "Voting Issues and Gerrymanders Are Now Key Political Battlegrounds", "category": "Politics", "id": "6b4e6965-9805-4c10-9b5f-9e4963e12ce0", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/voting-gerrymander-elections.html", "publishdate": 20190102, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/28/us/politics/00VOTING-promo/merlin_146440041_ea08fb1a-7265-455a-a46f-3a45c7d79607-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Voting rights and partisan gerrymandering, traditionally the preoccupation of wonky party strategists and good-government groups, have become major flash points in the debate about the integrity of American elections, signaling high stakes battles over voter suppression and politically engineered districts ahead of the 2020 presidential race.When Democrats take the majority in the House on Thursday, the first bill they plan to introduce will be broad legislation focusing on these issues. Early drafts of their proposals include automatic voter registration, public elections financing and ending gerrymandering by using independent commissions to draw voting districts.But action and anger go far beyond Congress. With voters increasingly aware of the powerful impact of gerrymandering and doubtful about the fairness of elections, voting issues have become central to politics in key states including Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Questions about the health of American democracy are being raised in areas once thought to be wholly nonpartisan, as reflected in a court battle over whether the Trump administration is trying to use a question about citizenship on the 2020 census to undercount Democratic constituencies and limit their political clout.Voters in five states last year passed ballot questions shifting the power to draw political districts away from partisan lawmakers.In widely criticized lame-duck sessions of the Wisconsin and Michigan Legislatures, Republicans raced to strip powers from new Democratic governors, partly to protect their ability to gerrymander after the 2020 census.In Florida, voters approved a ballot initiative to restore voting rights for more than a million convicted felons, while in Georgia, questions about the legitimacy of the victory by the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, revolved around allegations that his office suppressed the votes of minorities in the state.At issue, many voting experts say, is a momentous clash between demographic changes that are slowly and powerfully reshaping the American electorate, making it younger, more diverse and more favorable for Democrats, and the entrenched power of Republican lawmakers, who see restrictions on voting and partisan redistricting as ways to hold on to political power.\u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do is construct a system where a minority of the voters can actually obtain majority power,\u201d said the former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who sued states over voting rules during the Obama administration.Republicans say the influence of gerrymandering is overblown. They argue that Democrats fail to win seats in proportion to their popular votes because Democratic voters are clustered in urban districts. Republicans defend voting restrictions like ID laws as popular with majorities in both parties and needed to ensure confidence in elections.That concerns about gerrymandering have gone mainstream was underlined last month when President Barack Obama said he would join forces with a group Mr. Holder leads, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. It was formed in 2017 in response to many state legislatures shifting sharply to the right on abortion, taxes, education and collective bargaining. Democrats contend those shifts were built on Republicans\u2019 securing majorities at the state level through extreme gerrymandering after the 2010 census.The Republican State Leadership Committee, which helped secure many of those statehouse victories, argues the initial races were run in districts drawn by Democrats in previous decades. Matt Walter, the committee\u2019s president, said some of the 2018 ballot measures to make redistricting less partisan were quietly backed by groups that seek to elect more Democrats.ImageAshley Oleson, with the League of Women Voters of Maryland, carrying cutouts of Maryland\u2019s districts at a protest against gerrymandering in front of the Supreme Court in March.CreditJacquelyn Martin/Associated Press\u201cCleverly worded ballot measures regarding redistricting are often nothing more than Democrat politics wrapped in some sort of illusion of citizen-participated good government,\u201d he said.Indeed, Democrats have also benefited from partisan maps in states like Maryland. Still, when Democrats in New Jersey recently sought to benefit from midterm gains and overhaul how legislative maps are drawn, Mr. Holder and other fair-voting groups opposed it. The proposal was scrapped.In the November elections, Democrats gained more House seats than they have in any midterm since Watergate, picking up 40 seats. But the gains might have been even bigger, election experts said, if Republican gerrymanders hadn\u2019t been drawn to withstand a blue wave.In Ohio, Republicans won 52 percent of the overall votes for Congress, but they retained 11 of the state\u2019s 16 House seats.In North Carolina, Republicans won 50 percent of the popular congressional vote, but 9 out of 12 seats, not counting one still in dispute.\u201cIt\u2019s the result of digitally diabolical gerrymandering,\u201d said Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat.North Carolina has been ground zero for what critics call aggressive Republican attacks on democracy, including a strict voter ID law, extreme partisan gerrymandering and a power grab during a lame-duck session of the legislature after Mr. Cooper\u2019s election in 2016. Courts have overturned many of these efforts.The governor echoed critics of gerrymandering who say that putting lawmakers in safe districts leads to partisan polarization, because incumbents fear only a primary challenge from the extremes and lack any incentive to reach across the aisle.\u201cIt has prevented progress in North Carolina on closing the health care gap,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cI think in Washington it has torpedoed common sense immigration reform.\u201d In June, the United States Supreme Court sidestepped the question of whether partisan gerrymandering was unconstitutional.Republican supermajorities in both of the state\u2019s legislative chambers have overridden 22 of Mr. Cooper\u2019s vetoes. In November, Democrats flipped enough seats in the General Assembly to limit Republicans to simple majorities, restoring the governor\u2019s veto authority. Rather than wait for the new legislature to convene in January, Republicans met this month to override two of Mr. Cooper\u2019s vetoes of voting laws.Phil Berger, the president of the State Senate, said critics accusing North Carolina Republicans of undermining democracy ignore the fact that the party won its majorities in 2010 using maps drawn by Democrats. The laws enacted since then, including voter ID, reflect the will of the majority, he said.\u201cThe Democrats have a geographic problem,\u201d Mr. Berger said, referring to the clustering of Democratic voters in a handful of cities. \u201cOur view is we were returning North Carolina to more of the mainstream.\u201dIf North Carolina was the template, Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin and Michigan both met in lame-duck sessions last year to strip powers away from incoming Democratic governors. Speaker Robin J. Vos of the Wisconsin State Assembly was candid about his motives for checking the incoming governor, Tony Evers, the former state superintendent of schools. \u201cWe are going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in,\u201d he said in early December.Wisconsin\u2019s legislative maps, drawn in 2011, protected Republican supermajorities even after Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was defeated last year. Republican candidates for the State Assembly won just 46 percent of the popular vote, but they captured 64 percent of the chamber\u2019s seats.Barry Burden, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, called the results \u201ca beautiful gerrymander\u201d because Republicans were protected even in a bad year for their party.ImageA sign outside the Ashippun Town Hall near Oconomowoc, Wis., in November.CreditTim Gruber for The New York TimesIn Michigan, however, most of the Republican pushback against the election results fizzled, either because bills died in the legislature or were vetoed by former Gov. Rick Snyder.According to the Brennan Center for Justice, 24 states, most Republican-led, have introduced restrictions that have made access to voting harder since 2010.Wendy R. Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, said there was a correlation between states that have restricted voting and those with high African-American turnout in 2008, the first year Mr. Obama was elected, as well as those that recorded large increases in Hispanic population in the 2010 census.\u201cThe more a state saw an increase in political participation by African-Americans or an increase in the Latino population, the more likely they\u2019d introduce new laws cutting back on voting access,\u201d she said.At the same time, many states have expanded voting access in recent years. Midterm voters in Nevada passed automatic registration for those receiving a driver\u2019s license, and Maryland authorized same-day registration at the polls. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is calling for an overhaul of the state\u2019s voting laws, considered among the most archaic in the country.At the opposite end of the spectrum, advocates of restrictions such as voter ID laws say they are needed to prevent fraud, despite multiple studies showing in-person fraud is extremely rare. A federal appeals court that struck down North Carolina\u2019s voter ID law in 2016 said it was drafted to target blacks \u201cwith almost surgical precision.\u201dOne of the Republicans defeated at the polls last year, Kris W. Kobach, lost a race for Kansas governor after being rebuked in federal court for insisting without evidence that noncitizen voting was widespread. Mr. Kobach had led the commission to look into President Trump\u2019s baseless claim that millions of undocumented immigrants voted in 2016. It disbanded without documenting his claim.Polls show Americans are increasingly concerned about the structure of elections. Only 51 percent believed that elections are fair and open in a July Ipsos poll. A Pew Research Center survey in October found wide partisan gaps over easing access to voting, with more Democrats than Republicans favoring the ability to register on Election Day, the restoration of felons\u2019 voting rights and the automatic registration of all eligible voters.The issue has become a galvanizing one for Democratic candidates.Kamala Harris, the senator from California and a likely Democratic presidential candidate, tweeted last week: \u201cAs states across the country are actively making it harder for Americans to vote, my Democratic colleagues are committed to strengthening access to the ballot box. Reinvigorating the Voting Rights Act, expanding early voting, and automatic registration are a place to start.\u201dIn November, voters in Colorado, Missouri, Michigan and Utah approved changes to limit the role of partisanship in drawing congressional and legislative districts. Ohio passed a similar measure in May.But in Missouri, Gov. Michael L. Parson, a Republican, opposed the popular vote to turn over mapmaking to a \u201cnonpartisan state demographer,\u201d which could increase Democratic representation. The governor called for the measure\u2019s repeal.Missouri reflects the way even popular elections often fail to settle voting-related disputes. In Florida, Democrats say Republicans are already looking for ways to avoid carrying out the initiative allowing people convicted of felonies to vote.Mr. Holder, who is among the Democrats considering a presidential run, said issues about voting and democracy are now central to American politics.\u201cHealth care will clearly be the primary issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think if you\u2019re looking for a top-five issue, this one has broken through and will be something people will talk about and make their decision about who they\u2019re going to vote for.\u201d"}, {"title": "Volatility Continues as Rising Oil Prices Help Wall St. Erase Early Losses", "category": "Business", "id": "bdeb192d-f56f-4e57-bf8b-fc158e4065d1", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/business/global-stock-markets.html", "publishdate": 20190102, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/business/03Markets-1/03Markets-1-articleLarge-v2.png", "content": "The new year began with another round of choppy trading on Wall Street, as stocks opened sharply lower but recouped their losses after a rise in oil prices lifted shares of energy producers.Volatility has been a defining characteristic of the stock market lately. Investors are trying to gauge the odds of an economic slowdown in the United States, and how such an event might be affected by rising interest rates, uncertainty in American politics and a trade war with China.[Wall Street\u2019s stock pickers are still hopeful about the year ahead, but here are four things they\u2019re worried about.]The tone on Wednesday was initially set by fresh evidence that the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second largest, is slowing. Factory activity in the country fell last month, according to government and private data released this week, an indication that the trade war is beginning to weigh on Chinese manufacturing.But a spike in crude oil futures helped Wall Street overcome the slump after Bloomberg released data that indicated exports from Saudi Arabia had slowed. The American crude benchmark rose as high as $47.78 a barrel before ending the day at $46.54, up 2.5 percent. In 2018, oil prices experienced their first decline in three years, amid worries about excess supply and softer demand.After falling more than 1.5 percent in early trading, the S & P 500 ended slightly higher for the day. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fared better, rising 0.5 percent.Shares in oil companies like Exxon Mobil tracked the gains in crude oil, rising more than 2 percent. Other standouts in Wednesday trading included gaming companies like Wynn Resorts, which rose 5.6 percent after the authorities in Macau reported that gaming revenue there rose more than 16 percent in December. Wynn and other American casino operators have a large presence in the territory, which is a destination for wealthy Chinese gamblers.Also notable on Wednesday was a drop in shares of Tesla, the electric carmaker. The stock dropped 6.8 percent after the company announced a price cut that could suggest softer demand.Shares in Asia were broadly lower after the weaker factory data from China. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 2.8 percent. In China, the Shanghai Composite index fell 1.2 percent and the Shenzhen Composite index 0.9 percent.The Taiex index in Taiwan fell 1.8 percent, while the Kospi in South Korea was down 1.5 percent. Japan\u2019s markets were closed for a holiday.Manufacturing data for the eurozone that was released on Wednesday also showed an across-the-board slowdown in December. But stock benchmarks in Europe also ended well off their lowest levels of the day.

On bad ones, it\u2019s a cranked-to-11 therapy session to the loudest tracks on your Spotify playlist.Factory audio systems in cars were once, at best, an AM-FM radio with a cassette player and a couple of speakers crammed into leftover dashboard space. A turning point came in 1982, when Bose tuned a system to the acoustics inside a 1983 Cadillac Seville. This audio revolution heard around the world featured four speakers. Four.Today, solid midpriced systems pack a dozen. The best are so immersive, your next automobile decision might come down to how well the car stereo rocks your favorite Alabama Shakes song.Chances are a team larger than the Count Basie Orchestra designed the stereo in your car. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a challenge to put a good sound system into a vehicle,\u201d said Chris Ludwig, vice president of Harman Lifestyle Automotive, whose audio and infotainment systems are in tens of millions of cars.\u201cWe sit down with the manufacturer and find out if the target is best-in-class or affordability, then go forward,\u201d Mr. Ludwig said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just cost and sound quality. It\u2019s about dimensions, aesthetics and weight. Automakers want to shave off every gram.\u201dTo grasp the heroics of your car\u2019s system, consider the home setup. Traditionally good ones have an amp, a tuner, a CD player and a turntable for vinyl aficionados. Decent speakers can be two feet high with heavy ferrite magnet drivers hidden by gossamer cloth grilles. My living room system with a subwoofer satellite speaker setup weighs 45 pounds. It remains dry and temperature-controlled (unless my furnace conks out again). Other than an earthquake and the bass produced by \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust,\u201d it has seen no vibration.Now reflect on car electronics. They\u2019re jammed into small spaces. Door speakers endure thousands of slams and pothole shock. Grilles protect from shoes and elbows yet remain acoustically neutral. For lightness, car speakers use neodymium drivers. Components need to survive North Pole and Death Valley conditions, for the life of the car.To commemorate its first car audio system, Bose tracked down a 30-year-old Seville. Its audio system still worked.Ultimately, systems need to be light and small but big on entertainment. The average sound system weighs under 10 pounds, Mr. Ludwig said, with \u201cthe ones in hybrids and electric cars weighing around five pounds.\u201dImageIn tests, Bose car speakers are subjected to extreme temperatures and \u201csalt fog,\u201d to make sure components won\u2019t corrode.CreditBoseEven the most luxurious car cabin is a torture chamber for sound systems. John Pelliccio, head of product communications at Bose, said its components \u201care subjected to \u2018salt fog\u2019 to ensure they won\u2019t corrode in coastal regions and Northern areas where salt is used to keep streets ice free.\u201dThe testing is just getting started. \u201cWe have temperature chambers that rapidly cycle between minus-40 and 176 degrees Fahrenheit to ensure solder joints don\u2019t fail during extreme temperature swings when heating frozen interiors in Alaskan winters or cooling them in Arizona heat,\u201d Mr. Pelliccio said. \u201cThey must be fairly waterproof, too \u2014 door speakers get rained and splashed on.\u201dAnything audio companies can do to make installation easier on the assembly line saves money, too; Bose devised a \u201cone screw\u201d method to securely install speakers. And poor-quality components mean the expense of warranty replacement. Mr. Pelliccio claims a failure rate of three parts per million, and said Bose\u2019s total annual defective components fit in a wheelbarrow.While the carmakers and the audio teams must battle over environment, budget, weight and space, owners simply want their vehicle to sound as if Ariana Grande were riding shotgun.Typically, an automotive sound system is the best one people own. Audio engineers look at the car cabin both as a wonderfully controlled space to acoustically tune and a nightmare of reflective surfaces, absorptive materials and constantly changing exterior sounds that obliterate fidelity.Mark Ziemba, audio systems manager at Panasonic Automotive, acknowledged that \u201cthe sound stage in a car isn\u2019t optimal.\u201d\u201cThe driver sits to one side with one ear six inches away from reflective glass, while the other is left open against upholstery,\u201d Mr. Ziemba said. \u201cAnd every vehicle is different, so they have to be tuned accordingly.\u201dBecause of psychoacoustics, ears don\u2019t easily locate the sources of bass frequencies, so subwoofers can be tucked into the cargo area. The rear seat-back material can act as a filter to eliminate distortion. Cloth seats absorb treble. Leather reflects it.Some cars, like Honda\u2019s Pilot, offer a choice of upholstery. While developing the electronics for the Pilot, Mr. Ziemba\u2019s team produced two software profiles to optimize the sound for each cabin. On Honda\u2019s assembly line, the units are coded for fabric or cowhide.At Acura, the sound profile for the standard MDX and RLX is different from the hybrid versions, since the hybrid powertrain, heavier and stiffer, changes the interior\u2019s tonal quality.ImageWhen tuning an audio system for a car, companies like Bose must account for environment, budget, weight and space.CreditBoseMr. Ziemba and Elliot Scheiner, a Grammy-winning producer, teamed up 17 years ago to improve audiophile systems. Mr. Scheiner, who has produced albums for Steely Dan, Sting and Foo Fighters, grew frustrated after listening to studio mixes in automobiles.The latest system to bear his initials, the ELS Studio 3D available in the 2019 Acura RDX crossover, uses slim roof-mounted drivers to anchor vocals, bass, drums, brass and guitar to a sound field that\u2019s not just left and right but front, side and rear. It\u2019s so precisely tuned there\u2019s a separate version of the software for RDXs with a \u201chead up\u201d instrument display to compensate for the windshield coating and dashboard projector.The ELS Studio 3D, along with the 34-speaker Bose Panaray in Cadillac\u2019s CT6 and the Bang & Olufsen 3D Advanced Sound System in Audi\u2019s Q7, has caused me to linger in the driveway for hours. The optional Mark Levinson Reference Surround audio in a Lexus LC sounds like a $100,000 home system. The whole car costs $4,000 less than that.Automakers provide audio companies preproduction interior prototypes to tune the sound. The grille material and hole pattern make a difference: Metal is more acoustically transparent than plastic. Designers in both camps haggle over placement and aesthetics. In the past, automakers preferred resin grilles because they can blend into the interior. Aluminum with laser-drilled holes is becoming more popular. The metal confers a status symbol appearance.Automakers find that a premium logo affixed to speaker grilles helps to sell a car. Fiat Chrysler licenses Beats Audio to appeal to younger shoppers, though it\u2019s not clear who manufactures it. For example, Harman makes JBL, Harman Kardon, Infinity, Mark Levinson, Revel and Lexicon. It licenses Bang & Olufsen and Bowers & Wilkins for the car. Panasonic produces ELS, Fender and Blue Note.It\u2019s not simply branding. Engineers strive to recreate a company\u2019s signature sound in the automobile.\u201cThe Bose sound is something our customers actively want, and we deliver the same quality whether it\u2019s home, headphone or car audio,\u201d Mr. Pelliccio said.The systems go beyond music. Think of all the warning tones and navigation alerts chirping through the speakers. Most systems are smart enough to ramp the music volume down while delivering some messages. (Usually during the song\u2019s best part, right?) Multiple source inputs and Bluetooth support are essential.Some systems even work like noise-cancellation headphones, on a bigger scale. Microphones sample the road noise and then pump a reverse waveform into the cabin. That helps eliminate heavy sound insulation, adding to fuel efficiency.To give small modern turbocharged engines a large pleasing throat, similar electronics reduce dissonant drivetrain notes and augment pleasing major tones through the speakers.

Celgene shareholders will get one Bristol-Myers share and $50 in cash for each Celgene share. The deal values Celgene shares at $102.43 apiece, a 53.7 percent premium on the stock\u2019s closing price on Wednesday.The deal, which both companies\u2019 boards have approved, will help the drugmakers advance their work in oncology, cardiovascular disease, immunology and inflammation, Bristol-Myers said in its statement. Celgene is known for its blockbuster Thalomid and Revlimid cancer medicines.\u201cWe are very excited about this,\u201d Dr. Giovanni Caforio, the chief executive and chairman of Bristol-Myers, said in an interview Thursday.Shares of Celgene, which is based in Summit, N.J., were up around 25 percent by midday on Thursday, while shares in Bristol-Meyers, which has its headquarters in New York, were down about 13 percent.The transaction comes after a rocky period for Celgene. The company\u2019s share price fell about 40 percent over the past year amid concerns that it was relying too heavily on Revlimid, which accounts for about two-thirds of its sales. The drug faces a so-called patent cliff, when its patents will expire and cheaper generic rivals could enter the market.Celgene, citing concerns for patient safety, has resisted sharing Revlimid samples with potential rivals, hoping to produce less-expensive generic versions of the drug. Celgene tops a Food and Drug Administration list meant to shame companies trying to block such competition. The company has also been criticized for raising the prices of Revlimid and other medications, and has had  setbacks in its drug-development pipeline.In 2017, Celgene, without acknowledging wrongdoing, agreed to pay a total of $280 million to the federal government, 28 states and the District of Columbia to settle claims that it had marketed Thalomid and Revlimid for unapproved uses.Last January, Celgene agreed to pay up to $7 billion to acquire the biotechnology company Impact Biomedicines in hopes of expanding its presence in the market for blood-disease drugs. Shortly after that, Celgene announced a $9 billion deal to buy Juno Therapeutics, a start-up that is developing potentially groundbreaking cancer treatments, in which it already had a roughly 10 percent stake.The price of Celgene\u2019s drugs became a political issue in New Jersey last year when Bob Hugin, who spent seven years as the company\u2019s chief executive, ran unsuccessfully as a Republican against Senator Robert Menendez, the incumbent Democrat.During Mr. Hugin\u2019s nearly 20 years at Celgene, the company raised the price of Revlimid to $16,000 from $6,000. He stepped down as chief executive in 2017.Like Celgene, Bristol-Myers has focused on cancer treatments. Its products include the drugs Opdivo and Yervoy, which were among the first so-called immunotherapy drugs to use the body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer. They are also expensive, costing $100,000 a year.Sales of Opdivo have lagged behind a competing Merck drug, Keytruda. In 2016, Opdivo failed as an initial treatment for lung cancer in a clinical trial, causing Bristol-Myers\u2019s stock price to sink.The deal, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close in the third quarter. Two members of the Celgene board will join the Bristol-Myers board."}, {"title": "Last Month, Investors Seemed Too Pessimistic.

President Trump\u2019s bellicose trade actions were a concern, but hiring was strong and corporate earnings were surging.But this week, companies have issued warnings about the health of their businesses that suggest investors were right to be worried about growth. On Wednesday, Apple reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years, citing weak iPhone sales in China. On Thursday, Delta Air Lines said its fare revenue, while growing, would fall short of the company\u2019s earlier forecast. And the American manufacturing sector slowed sharply last month, according to a closely watched index released Thursday.In the coming weeks, scores of companies will report their fourth-quarter results. A senior White House economics official acknowledged that there could be a torrent of bad news from corporate America.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be just Apple,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN on Thursday. \u201cThere are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.\u201dHe seemed to suggest that was not necessarily bad, because it could help the Trump administration achieve its goal of getting China to make trade concessions to the United States.Those comments did little to assuage the fears of investors. The S&P 500 stock index closed down about 2.5 percent, leaving it more than 16 percent below the high it hit in September. But perhaps the most notable move was in the market for government bonds, where investors park their money in times of stress or when they expect the economy to slow. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 2.56 percent, well below the level it reached in early November, when investors were more optimistic about the economy.\u201cOn days like today people say, \u2018Crud, I\u2019ve got to buy tons of bonds,\u2019\u201d said Jim Vogel, a fixed income strategist at FTN Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s driven by a large change in sentiment.\u201dImportant indicators still show the American economy is growing at a decent clip. A measure of employment in the private sector in December, released Thursday, was higher than expected. And ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s monthly jobs report on Friday, analysts estimated that employers added about 180,000 jobs in December.Despite this, companies and consumers are facing challenges that could make them more cautious about spending money. If they pull back, the economy will suffer. Apple\u2019s warning provides strong evidence that the trade tensions with China are taking a toll. And if more indicators show the American economy stumbling, investors will become more convinced that the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent interest rate increases are dampening activity.Corporate profits \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 are highly sensitive to global economic weakness. Foreign sales accounted for 45 percent of the revenues of companies in the S&P 500 stock index over the last five years.There are signs of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies beginning to weigh on domestic demand, too. The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that its index of manufacturing activity fell sharply in December, the largest one-month drop since the last recession.The manufacturing index fell to what is still considered a healthy level, consistent with other data generally showing that the economy remains in good shape. But the downward trend contributed to a growing sense of unease on Wall Street about how soon the current expansion might end.\u201cWhen it has seeped into the survey it probably means it\u2019s three to five weeks old,\u201d Mr. Vogel said.Indeed, investors are so convinced trouble is coming that they are betting the Federal Reserve will abandon its plans to raise interest rates in 2019.Fed officials predicted in mid-December that the central bank would raise its benchmark rate twice this year, moving the rate into a \u201cneutral\u201d range that neither stimulates nor discourages economic activity. By the end of trading Thursday, the odds of an interest-rate cut in 2019 had climbed above 50 percent.Robert Kaplan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, reinforced those expectations, telling Bloomberg Television that the Fed should wait at least a few months before considering any additional increases.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be taking any further action until some of these uncertainties resolve themselves, and I think that could take several months,\u201d he said on Thursday.Mr. Kaplan, however, is not a voting member of the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee this year. The committee comprises the Fed\u2019s board of governors and a rotating selection of five of the 12 presidents of regional reserve banks.An indication of the Fed\u2019s views could come Friday morning, when the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, is scheduled to answer questions at a public appearance with his two immediate predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke.\u201cThere\u2019s a belief he\u2019s willing to back off, but we haven\u2019t seen that yet,\u201d Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, said, referring to Mr. Powell. \u201cIf the Fed hikes rates in March, it\u2019ll be a mess.\u201dAnd on Thursday an ominous event occurred in the government bond market. The yield on the 5-year Treasury note fell below that of the 3-month Treasury bill. Yields are generally higher on longer-term debt. An inversion of that pattern signals a loss of confidence in longer-term economic prospects and has often served as an early warning of a recession.Investors and corporate executives have experience with slowdowns in large overseas economies, but they have not had to simultaneously grapple with the effects of a trade war. In explaining Apple\u2019s lowered sales forecast, the company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, said, \u201cThe economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.\u201d Apple\u2019s stock plunged nearly 10 percent on Thursday, taking its market value down to around $675 billion, well below the $1.1 trillion it reached as recently as October.Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs have raised prices on a wide range of Chinese components used by American manufacturers. Roughly half of the companies in the I.S.M. survey said tariffs were weighing on profits, or raising costs.Linton Crystal Technologies, a firm based in Rochester, makes specialized furnaces used to grow silicon tubes, which are cut into wafers for semiconductors and solar panels that are sold to customers all over the world. The work was once performed entirely in the United States. But even though they are still designed, assembled and customized in the United States, the machines\u2019 components now are built in China.Mr. Trump has said the goal of his trade policies was to convince companies like Linton to bring back jobs from China. Mr. Hassett emphasized on Thursday that the Trump administration expected the domestic economy to remain strong, and that companies focused on the United States would benefit.But Todd Barnum, Linton Crystal\u2019s chief operating officer, said the cost of making furnaces entirely in the United States was prohibitive. And as a result of the tariffs, the company is also moving design work to China \u2014 a move Mr. Barnum said would save hundreds of thousands of dollars in tariffs by reducing the need for prototypes to be shipped to the United States.\u201cOur customers don\u2019t care if it was manufactured in the United States,\u201d Mr. Barnum said. \u201cThey care about the highest quality at the lowest dollar.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: Apple\u2019s Struggles Add to Uncertainty in Markets", "category": "Business", "id": "e5674557-75af-4a3e-8ead-ddb1289cabc1", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/business/dealbook/apple-china-slowdown-markets.html", "publishdate": 20190103, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/business/03dbapple/merlin_129549464_400b3113-00ac-4308-8c3c-ce140989fcc5-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Thursday morning.

A significant slowdown in iPhone sales in China forced the company to reduce revenue expectations for its most recent quarter. The company said yesterday that it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Dec. 29, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion.It was the first time Apple had lowered its quarterly forecast in 16 years.

China has become Apple\u2019s third-largest market in recent years, driven mostly by iPhone sales.\u201dApple\u2019s announcement is the latest warning from corporate America about the impact of the trade war, which may be harder to defend now that the collateral damage includes one of the country\u2019s most recognizable brands. Companies like FedEx and Starbucks are already struggling in China.

Of those, 63,150 were Model 3 sedans, a 13 percent improvement on the prior three-month span, but nonetheless below Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The growth rate for the Model 3, Tesla\u2019s first mass-market offering, fell short compared with the third quarter, when sales more than doubled amid a rush of initial orders.Demand concerns: Investors were especially perturbed by Tesla\u2019s announcement that it was cutting prices of all models in the U.S. by $2,000 per car. The automaker said it was adjusting to a Jan. 1 reduction of a federal electric-vehicle tax credit for Tesla buyers to $3,750 from $7,500. But what the market saw was a warning that, after a surge of early interest in the Model 3, buyers may be waiting for a more affordable option, writes Bloomberg Opinion\u2019s Liam Denning:\u201cThis suggests that the vast majority of reservation holders are either waiting overseas, where Tesla says deliveries should start next month, or (and this is probably the bigger group) are waiting for cheaper variants such as the long-promised $35,000 version. That latter group poses a potential threat to Tesla\u2019s profit margins in the quarters ahead, especially as Model 3 production remains below previous targets.\u201dTesla shares ended trading nearly 7 percent lower.Censorship in China becomes a growing businessThousands of low-wage workers in China are trawling the internet in search of forbidden content in a lucrative new industry: censorship factories.Playing it safe: For Chinese companies, staying on the safe side of government censors is a matter of life and death. Adding to the burden, the authorities demand that companies censor themselves, spurring them to hire thousands of people to police content. \u201cIt helps cleanse the online environment,\u201d one worker said.Little tolerance: China has built the world\u2019s most extensive and sophisticated online censorship system. It grew even stronger under President Xi Jinping, who wants the internet to play a greater role in strengthening the Communist Party\u2019s hold on society. More content is considered sensitive. Punishments are getting more severe.Rising influence: China\u2019s vision of a government-supervised internet reverberates in other countries. Even in Western Europe and the United States, traditional bastions of free expression, companies are examining their digital limits. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube have said that they would hire thousands more workers to better monitor their content.ImageThe rocket transporting the Chang\u2019e-4 lunar probe lifting off in China on Dec. 8.CreditAgence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesChina\u2019s \u2018new chapter\u2019 in lunar explorationChina may have missed the starting gun in the international space race, but said today that it was the first to land a lunar probe on the far side of the moon.The Chang\u2019e-4 vehicle, named after the lunar goddess in Chinese mythology, landed in the moon\u2019s oldest and deepest crater and sent back the first close-up images of a region that perpetually faces away from earth.The China National Space Administration, which hopes to put astronauts in a lunar base by the end of the next decade, called the feat \u201ca new chapter in humanity\u2019s exploration of the moon.\u201d The mission could help advance understanding of the moon\u2019s origins and evolution, and better position China to tap minerals and other resources discovered there.China landed a rover on the moon in 2013, decades after a Soviet Union spacecraft reached the surface in 1959 and the United States successfully sent its Apollo 11 team in 1969. China\u2019s future plans in space involve sending astronauts to Mars and a probe to Jupiter, according to the WSJ.The evolution of human welfare\u201cThe world got better last year, and it is going to get even better this year,\u201d Greg Ip writes in the WSJ. Problems like illiteracy, poverty and violent deaths have been dropping worldwide, Ip writes, but the news has received little attention because the decline has been slow and steady.The gradual progress is coming about through basic rules of growth:\u201cInvest more in your human and physical capital, open yourself to markets and trade \u2014 that\u2019s right, globalization is good \u2014 and incomes will rise.\u201dThis has lead to momentous change: Half the world is now middle class.Revolving doorHalliburton named Jeff Miller its chairman after David Lesar retired on Monday following a 25-year career with the company.

In some cases, Career Education charged students for vocational programs that lacked the accreditation needed for them to obtain a license and work in their field, according to the settlement documents.Career Education, based in Schaumburg, Ill., denied any wrongdoing. Todd Nelson, the company\u2019s chief executive, called the settlement an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d in its turnaround efforts. The company was once among the country\u2019s largest for-profit education chains but has shrunk to about a third of its former size as state and federal regulators increased their scrutiny of the kind of vocational programs it runs.The debt being eliminated averaged about $2,750 per person. Career Education had already written most of it off as bad debt, it said in a regulatory filing on Thursday. Only $1.3 million remained active on the company\u2019s financial statements.Career Education had until recently been trying to collect on a significant portion of the nearly $500 million owed to it by former students, according to Jessica Whitney, the consumer protection director for the Iowa attorney general\u2019s office. Those efforts must now stop, she said, and the company is required to ask credit bureaus to delete those debts from borrowers\u2019 credit reports.The deal affects only debt held by Career Education and does not cover federal student loans, which are managed by the Education Department, or private student loans owed to other lenders. The only state not included in Thursday\u2019s deal, California, is preparing its own settlement with Career Education, the company said.The Education Department can forgive the federal loans of students who were defrauded by their schools through its borrower defense program. At least 2,000 former Career Education students have applied for that relief, according to public records gathered by researchers, but the Education Department has not yet made a decision on any of those applications.The state investigators have offered to share their findings with the Education Department, Ms. Whitney said. Borrowers who file a new borrower defense application, or have one pending, \u201ccan certainly submit the facts of the case as evidence\u201d to support their claim, said Liz Hill, an Education Department spokeswoman.At its peak, Career Education enrolled more than 100,000 students at 100 campuses worldwide, including the Le Cordon Bleu chain of culinary schools and the vocationally focused Sanford-Brown Colleges and Institutes.But a string of lawsuits and a nationwide regulatory crackdown on for-profit schools sharply reduced its financial fortunes. In 2015, the company decided to close most of its campuses. Its two remaining chains, American InterContinental University and Colorado Technical University, which operate mainly online, enrolled about 35,000 students last year.The settlement requires Career Education to provide its students with a single-page disclosure clearly describing their program\u2019s expected cost and the typical student loan debt and earnings of a graduate. It must also pay an outside monitor to review its compliance with various consumer protection rules.Shares of the publicly traded company ended trading on Thursday up 2 percent, at $11.74."}, {"title": "As House of Representatives Convenes, There\u2019s One Empty Seat", "category": "Politics", "id": "124c9e88-39de-4717-94f5-8eb837d62882", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/us/politics/mark-harris-nc-congress.html", "publishdate": 20190103, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/04/us/politics/04carolina-print/merlin_146488227_c104ef6b-ccd4-4f67-91a3-e642f350076d-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "If all had gone as he hoped, Mark Harris would have been sworn in to the House of Representatives Thursday as the new member from North Carolina\u2019s Ninth Congressional District.Instead, as the new House was installed, Mr. Harris, a Southern Baptist preacher and staunch conservative, was far from Washington and his seat still up for grabs. There are increasing worries it could remain vacant for months.Mr. Harris, whose election is now in limbo because of fraud allegations against one of his campaign contractors, instead spent much of the day at another government office. He was being interviewed by elections investigators in Raleigh looking into the unusual handling of absentee ballots by the contractor, L. McCrae Dowless Jr.Standing outside the investigators\u2019 offices, Mr. Harris expressed his disappointment.\u201cI am the one seat remaining of the 435 to be seated,\u201d he said, in remarks to reporters broadcast by WSOC-TV, the ABC affiliate in Charlotte. \u201cWe kind of find ourselves in no-man\u2019s land, if you will, and we have asked the court to step in.\u201dAlso Thursday, lawyers for Mr. Harris filed a petition in Wake County Superior Court in Raleigh demanding that he be named the victor in the race while the investigation unfolds. No hearing date has been set.Mr. Harris led his Democratic opponent Dan McCready, a Marine veteran and business owner, by 905 votes on Nov. 6.But the state\u2019s elections board declined to certify the election following allegations of possible absentee-vote tampering in two rural counties, throwing the outcome of the election, and the congressional seat, into limbo.Fingers have been pointed at a get-out-the-vote effort led by Mr. Dowless, a felon who was being paid as a contractor by the Harris campaign. Mr. Harris has denied wrongdoing but acknowledged that he directed the hiring of Mr. Dowless, a political operative in rural Bladen County who previously had been the focus of scrutiny following allegations of election tampering.The state\u2019s failure to certify a winner and the decision, instead, to open an investigation, has roiled North Carolina politics.Mr. Harris and his two lawyers met for nearly two hours with the elections board\u2019s executive director, Kim Westbrook Strach, and an investigator. \u201cWe appreciate his cooperation in the ongoing investigation,\u201d said Ms. Strach in an emailed statement.In his own statement, Mr. Harris said he appreciated the staff\u2019s courtesy and \u201csupport their efforts in getting the answers we all deserve. I look forward to a resolution soon so I can do what I was elected to do in Congress and be a voice for the people of the Ninth District.\u201dA Democrat who had served as chairman of the elections board, Joshua D. Malcolm, had complained that Mr. Harris had not been sufficiently responsive to a subpoena from the board. But Mr. Harris\u2019s lawyer, David Freedman, also in an emailed statement, said that Mr. Harris \u201ccontinues to be completely transparent and fully cooperative.\u201dThe investigation has been complicated by the unrelated dissolution of the appointed board that oversees the elections office, the result of a longstanding partisan disagreement in North Carolina.House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer said last week that Democrats would not seat Mr. Harris. \u201cIn this instance, the integrity of our democratic process outweighs concerns about the seat being vacant at the start of the new Congress,\u201d he said.As both the investigation and the legal case filed by Mr. Harris\u2019s camp move forward, local politicians seem all but certain that a special election will be called.Anticipating that, one organization, the Progressive Turnout Project, has posted on a \u201chelp wanted\u201d website used by liberal groups:\u201cProgressive Turnout Project (PTP) seeks applicants for an in-district operations director in North Carolina\u2019s Ninth Congressional District, in preparation for a potential special election to take place in 2019. This is a great opportunity for experienced field staff looking to take the next step in their career and gain operational experience.\u201dA spokeswoman for the organization, Priyal Amin, said the Progressive Turnout Project is \u201cfollowing this race very closely and just want to be prepared in event that there is an election held\u201d in the district. The job won\u2019t be filled until an election date is set, Ms. Amin said in an email.Some Republicans believe that, given the allegations, Mr. Harris would have a tricky path to victory, even in a primary, if one is called. But two of his most formidable potential rivals for the Republican nomination have firmly said that they do not intend to run for the Ninth District seat.\u201cRegardless of the determination of the evidentiary hearing, I will not be a candidate in a possible primary election,\u201d Representative Robert M. Pittenger, who Mr. Harris defeated in last May\u2019s Republican primary, said in a statement this week.And former Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, has repeatedly said that he has no plans to run. The decisions by both men could clear a path for other Republicans to challenge Mr. Harris."}, {"title": "Is \u2018Likability\u2019 in Politics Sexist? Yes.

We hope you\u2019re rested and ready for all that 2019 will bring. This is On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]When supporters of Elizabeth Warren gathered on Capitol Hill today, they were ostensibly celebrating the Massachusetts senator\u2019s swearing in to a second term.But it was hard to miss that crackle of presidential politics in the air. \u201cThe state of Warren nation is strong,\u201d shouted a gleeful Senator Ed Markey, as he introduced Ms. Warren to her fans. \u201cThe chief is here.\u201d Not long after, President Trump tweeted a meme featuring a \u201cWarren 2020\u201d sticker edited to mock her.Ms. Warren\u2019s highly choreographed announcement on Monday that she is exploring a bid for president was the political version of firing a starting pistol for the 2020 Democratic primary. She is the highest-profile Democratic contender to have entered the race, with national poll numbers, substantial grass-roots support and a sizable donor network. She\u2019s even headed to Iowa this weekend.Basically, it\u2019s game on.But, honestly, at this point, there isn\u2019t all that much of a game. Yes, more than three dozen candidates are considering running. And yes, as my colleague Alex Burns and I covered in the paper over the weekend, they\u2019re interviewing staff, scouting headquarters and fleshing out financial plans.But almost no one is actually running \u2014 at least not yet. We\u2019re still in that period of wild speculation. And with little visibly happening, political clich\u00e9s like \u201clikability\u201d and \u201celectability\u201d are bound to appear out of the ether to fill the void.That\u2019s part of what Ms. Warren discovered this week.Within hours of her tweet, she was \u201cbattling the ghosts of Hillary Clinton\u201d to avoid being written off as unlikable. She was a \u201cbelow par candidate,\u201d based on the size of her Senate victory in deep blue Massachusetts, who faces real \u201celectability\u201d problems.It\u2019s hard to see how these terms apply in the traditional sense in 2020. For the first time in 15 years, Democrats have an open field with no establishment favorite, so measuring electability is pretty difficult. And besides, being in the establishment may not be the asset it once was considered. At this point in 2015, Mrs. Clinton was seen as the most electable, even if she wasn\u2019t likable \u2014 and we all know how that story ended.The Democratic pollster Margie Omero says terms like \u201clikability\u201d aren\u2019t quite accurate in the Trump era. And you should forget about the old political chestnut that voters want \u201cthe guy they can have a beer with.\u201d\u201cObviously, people want someone that they like,\u201d says Ms. Omero. \u201cBut this sense that likability is the be-all and end-all of how voters view candidates is not really consistent with how we explore public opinion.\u201dA better measure, she says, comes from tracking job approval, empathy and the sense voters have that a candidate will fight for people like them. \u201cThere are plenty of successful politicians out there who seem like they\u2019re striving more to be tough fighters than huggy, baby-kissing kind of candidates,\u201d says Ms. Omero.Ahem, President Trump. Senator Mitch McConnell. Senator Ted Cruz. Senator Bernie Sanders.You might notice that they\u2019re all men. That\u2019s not surprising.A whole body of academic research on \u201clikability bias\u201d shows it\u2019s not enough for female leaders to be qualified \u2014 they have to be likable, too. Take Representative Nancy Pelosi, for example. For years, she\u2019s been a top target of Republicans in attack ads, a situation her opponents often attribute to the fact that she\u2019s a San Francisco liberal. But her equivalent in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, is a liberal from Brooklyn and far less targeted by Republicans.Or take those comparisons between Ms. Warren and the \u201cghosts of Hillary Clinton.\u201d They\u2019re both blond. They\u2019re both grandmothers. They\u2019re both female Democratic politicians. And they\u2019re both lawyers. Other than that, it\u2019s hard to see what, exactly, Ms. Warren and Ms. Clinton have in common.For her part, Ms. Warren largely refused to engage with issue of sexism or likability when I caught up with her on Capitol Hill today, dismissing the debate as a distraction. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep fighting on the issues because I think that\u2019s what matters most,\u201d she said.But her team saw some the value in the conversation: On Wednesday, they sent out a fund-raising email with the subject line \u201clikability.\u201dSo, does this mean that if you don\u2019t like Ms. Warren, you\u2019re sexist? Obviously not. There are plenty of reasons for Democrats to decide that Ms. Warren shouldn\u2019t be their nominee in 2020.But perhaps there needs to be a bit more specificity in the conversation when we talk about who we like and who we don\u2019t \u2014 and what, exactly, that means.[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.]____________________On the HillIt was a big day in Congress, as overjoyed Democrats assumed control of the House and Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath of office to incoming senators. Even President Trump got in on the action, talking to reporters in a surprise first visit to the White House briefing room.The celebratory mood isn\u2019t likely to last long. Overshadowing the day\u2019s festivities was the political impasse over the government shutdown, which Senator Richard Shelby warned could go on for \u201cmonths and months.\u201dNancy Pelosi was elected speaker. As expected, Ms. Pelosi returned to her post leading Congress, making it official that Democrats now control the House of Representatives. \u201cOur nation is at a historic moment,\u201d she said. \u201cThis Congress will be bipartisan, transparent and unified.\u201dNot all Democrats supported her. Keeping with the pledges they made on the campaign trail, more than a dozen Democrats, mostly freshman, cast their speaker votes elsewhere \u2014 including one for Joe Biden and another for Stacy Abrams. (See the full list here.)The Senate was sworn in, too. On the other side of the Capitol, things were a little more subdued, as Mr. Pence swore in more than 30 new senators. That chamber remains in Republican control, 53 to 47.____________________Catching upWith winter break behind us, it\u2019s time to snap out of our egg nog-induced haze and catch up on the stories we missed.

Late Wednesday it reduced its revenue forecast for its most recent quarter because of a significant slowdown in iPhone sales in China.Apple\u2019s stock fell 10 percent on Thursday, its worst one-day slide in six years. But the warning also rippled across its many suppliers.The chip makers Micron Technology and Advanced Micro Devices fell 5 percent and 9 percent. Qorvo, a maker of radio frequency chips, and Cirrus Logic, which supplies audio chips for the iPhone, dropped 9 percent.Lumentum, which supplies optical components for the iPhone, slid 8 percent. AMS, a maker of light sensors for smartphones, tumbled more than 20 percent.Since the iPhone was introduced in 2007, the market for mobile phones has become saturated. Even before Apple\u2019s warning \u2014 its first in 16 years \u2014 investors had started to grow worried about the company\u2019s ability to sell more phones.That\u2019s partly because Qorvo, Cirrus Logic, Lumentum and AMS had all already cut their revenue forecasts for the most recent quarter late last year. Though none of the companies mentioned Apple, the tech giant is the largest customer for each.Those announcements weighed heavily on Apple\u2019s stock.

He said the success in China of Xiaomi and Miniso, a chain of low-cost variety stores, suggested that Chinese consumers were looking to get more for their money.\u201cThe economy,\u201d Mr. Zhao said, \u201cis definitely very bad.\u201dA significant pullback could have a big impact on a world looking for engines of growth, on companies that counted on China\u2019s continuing expansion and on global investors who have long viewed Chinese consumers as a steady source of profits.Stock markets stumbled again on Thursday, in part over concerns that American companies and manufacturers are starting to feel the effects from the slowdown in China and the trade war. The S&P 500 sank 2.5 percent, while shares of Apple dropped nearly 10 percent after the company unexpectedly slashed its financial forecast, citing disappointing iPhones sales in the country.The rise of the Chinese consumer is not over yet, and Apple\u2019s disappointing numbers stem in part from the company\u2019s own decisions. But the weakness at Apple followed reams of other data \u2014 declining car sales, faltering retail sales, a slumping property market, a tougher job market \u2014 that signal Chinese consumers may be losing their once unshakable confidence.The sagging confidence could undermine China\u2019s efforts to redirect its economy and spur growth.The Chinese government hopes consumers will become a greater source of economic growth as the country\u2019s longtime reliance on government-sponsored infrastructure projects and old-line industries like steel and cement pays ever-smaller dividends. In recent years, Beijing has rolled out a huge social safety net, tax breaks and other incentives to get people to spend more of their own money on the trappings of middle-class life.ImageA production line at the FAW-Volkswagen Tianjin Plant in Tianjin, China. China\u2019s auto market, the world\u2019s biggest, experienced a sales decline in the first 11 months of last year.CreditChina Stringer Network/ReutersThe spending slowdown in China could be a worrying sign for many of America\u2019s biggest companies, too, at a time when their profits and stock prices are under pressure.Greater China \u2014 a region that includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan \u2014 is Apple\u2019s third-largest market after the United States and Europe, accounting for $52 billion in annual sales in the company\u2019s most recent fiscal year. General Motors, through local joint ventures, sells more cars in China than it does in the United States. Eight percent of Procter & Gamble\u2019s total sales in 2017 came from Greater China.Other companies are also feeling the pinch. China\u2019s auto market, the biggest in the world, saw sales fall during the first 11 months of last year. Sales of all smartphones fell by 13 percent in the third quarter of 2018.Chinese consumers continued to spend relatively briskly during other recent slowdowns, and they could still help get the country\u2019s economy back on track. But they have reasons to be reticent now.By many measures, the country\u2019s growth has slowed because of government efforts to wean the economy off a heavy reliance on borrowing as well as other policies that have shaken the confidence of the country\u2019s entrepreneurs.\u201cChina is at a turning point in its economy,\u201d said Andrew Collier, the founder of research firm Orient Capital Research. \u201cThey\u2019ve basically been on a debt-fueled binge for a decade.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to turn the ship from industry to consumer at a time of rough waters.\u201dFor many people, circumstances have changed.China has too many apartments that home buyers do not want, depressing a property market that is the largest source of wealth for Chinese households. The stock market lost around a quarter of its value in 2018.ImageA housing complex in Jurong, China. The country now has too many apartments that home buyers do not want.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesAnd although they  have a long way to go to catch up to Americans, Chinese households are laboring under growing amounts of debt. Unorthodox Chinese lenders like the online shadow-banking networks known as peer-to-peer lenders are stumbling, giving consumers fewer places to borrow more.Declining business confidence, rising labor costs and the trade war with the United States also appear to be hurting the job market.China does not disclose reliable unemployment data. But a recent survey by Mr. Collier of job postings, recruitment ads, numbers of applicants on recruitment websites and interviews with corporate managers suggested labor demand had weakened significantly. Hiring demand in import and export industries has been hit especially hard, falling 53 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier, the survey found.Against that backdrop, it is not surprising that many consumers are looking for ways to spend less.Wang Xiaochuan, who made about $145,000 a year as a pharmaceutical sales representative in Yantai in 2015, now makes less than a third of that thanks to a tightening of regulations on the drug industry. He has cut back his spending, buying Clarks shoes instead of the more expensive Ecco brand, or Coach goods rather than Louis Vuitton.\u201cI\u2019m hearing a lot more bad news about the economy than good news now,\u201d he said.In a country with an aspirational culture that for decades has encouraged people to get rich, Apple has long held a special place. Having a new iPhone meant its owner had made it. Seven years ago, the release of a new iPhone set off scuffles in front of an Apple store in Beijing.But price increases have put the iPhone beyond the reach of more and more Chinese buyers. An iPhone XR starts at 6,499 yuan, or about $950, just over two and a half months\u2019 worth of disposable income for the average Chinese person.Rumors once circulated about young people selling kidneys to buy an iPhone. Now, the online joke goes, it would cost two kidneys.ImageGarment workers at a factory in Guangzhou, China. Declining business confidence, rising labor costs and the trade war with the United States appear to be hurting the country\u2019s job market.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesOn the last day of 2018, William Tan, a 30-year-old university teacher in the southern city of Nanning, replaced his iPhone 7 with a phone made by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. Although the Huawei phone cost more than $700, about a month\u2019s salary for him, it was still more than $200 cheaper than the base iPhone XR. He had used an iPhone 5, 6 and 7. But when his iPhone 7 broke down, he found he could no longer afford the latest iPhone.The Huawei phone, he said, works fairly smoothly and takes better photos than the iPhone.\u201cI won\u2019t choose Apple again at this price range,\u201d he said.Chinese consumers are by no means done with certain discretionary purchases. Spending on movie tickets and services remains strong, economists said.But the consumer slowdown could worsen if Beijing does not address its economic problems.\u201cThe question is whether China can stabilize economic growth when it is facing economic headwinds,\u201d said Wei Li, senior China economist at Standard Chartered.\u201cIf the labor market does worsen in 2019 or if financial conditions don\u2019t improve, if the stock market remains low, all this could weigh on consumer confidence,\u201d Mr. Li said.Given the uncertainty, many Chinese spenders will most likely continue to scrimp.Wu Yan, a tech company worker who was looking at Xiaomi phones on Thursday afternoon, said he had also tried Apple and Huawei phones and had decided they were not much different from one another. What matters, he said, was the apps, and they work the same from phone to phone.But Mr. Wu, 40, also said many middle-class Chinese people like him had reached a stage where their work was stable, their income was secure and they no longer needed to show off their spending power. His computer at home? It\u2019s four or five years old now, but it still works fine.\u201cNow we spend just to fulfill our needs,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "Carlos Ghosn, Former Nissan Chairman, Will Appear in Court", "category": "Business", "id": "9a1d4e18-9b89-47d7-90a1-e3718ef02cab", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/business/carlos-ghosn-nissan-court.html", "publishdate": 20190104, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/05/world/05ghosn/merlin_148349460_e6ef91a8-80a4-4afe-8502-4890bc20a8cb-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "TOKYO \u2014 Carlos Ghosn will finally get a day in court.Mr. Ghosn, the embattled former chairman of Nissan Motor, is set to appear in a Tokyo court on Tuesday in what would be his first public appearance since his arrest in November. He has been held since then in a Tokyo jail and faces charges that he underreported his compensation to the Japanese authorities.His appearance is likely to further stoke interest in a legal and corporate clash that has shaken a global auto empire. The brash Mr. Ghosn won fame for turning around Nissan more than a decade ago and leading a car-making alliance that also includes Renault of France and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. He has since been ousted as Nissan\u2019s chairman, straining ties with Renault and leaving open the question of who will run a business that combined sells more than 10 million cars annually.Citing his lawyer, the Japanese public broadcaster, NHK, said Mr. Ghosn planned to appear. He will be allowed to speak at the hearing, though it was not clear what he might say. Mr. Ghosn\u2019s lawyer in Japan could not be reached for comment, and the lawyer\u2019s office was closed on Friday.Under Japanese law, Mr. Ghosn has the right to request that the court that allowed his detention explain its justification. In Japan, prosecutors can ask a court to keep suspects in custody for up to 22 days after their arrest.Mr. Ghosn has been arrested a total of three times over the past several weeks, allowing prosecutors and the court to keep resetting that clock. He was arrested the second time on similar accusations in December, and then a third time later that month on suspicions that he shifted some of his personal investment losses onto Nissan\u2019s books. After his third arrest, the court extended his detention to Jan. 11.It was not clear why Mr. Ghosn or his lawyers did not exercise the right to get more information from the court related to his earlier arrests.\u201cI would have done it earlier,\u201d said Nobuo Gohara, a former prosecutor and lawyer who is not representing Mr. Ghosn. \u201cIt\u2019s an effective method where the person detained, without contacting his families or supporters, can speak out publicly in open court.\u201d\u201cI think he has a lot he wants to say,\u201d Mr. Gohara said, \u201cand he wants to come out.\u201dMr. Ghosn\u2019s family has blamed corporate intrigue for the accusations against him, saying they are based on opposition to proposed changes in the alliance between Nissan and Renault.Another former Nissan executive, Greg Kelly, has also been charged with violating financial reporting laws. Mr. Kelly, who has denied wrongdoing, was released on bail last week.Prosecutors have also charged Nissan itself with violating financial reporting laws. Nissan has said that its own investigation is continuing and that it is reviewing its compliance procedures."}, {"title": "In Price and Value, Chinese Phone Makers Outpace Apple in Much of the World", "category": "Business", "id": "eb463694-22fe-44bc-ba61-6a222e9ac61e", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/technology/china-smartphones-iphone.html", "publishdate": 20190104, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/05/business/05chinaphone-1/05chinaphone-1-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 To most Americans, the names are unfamiliar, maybe a little hard to pronounce: Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo.They are China\u2019s biggest smartphone brands. Around the world \u2014 although not in the United States \u2014 they are making the handset business brutally competitive. This week, after Apple warned of disappointing iPhone sales in China, industry observers said that devices from the Chinese brands were a major culprit.As the phone market in China reaches saturation and sales shrink over all, the country\u2019s hardware makers are pushing hard, and increasingly winning fans, in places like France, Germany, India and Southeast Asia, where consumers find that the phones can do just about everything an iPhone can do at a fraction of the cost.Apple sits comfortably atop the market in many countries, including China, for the highest-end handsets. But companies like Huawei have started to do elsewhere what they have done in China, competing with the iPhone on experience and value and luring customers with price comparisons that make them rethink buying Apple\u2019s signature product.The cost difference is notable: In China, an iPhone XR starts at around $950, while Huawei\u2019s top-end handsets start at about $600, and Xiaomi\u2019s comparable models start at even less. The iPhone XS starts at around $1,250.Companies like Huawei and Oppo have made improvements in features and overall quality that are enticing many wealthy Chinese people, said Mo Jia, an analyst in Shanghai for the technology research firm Canalys. Chinese brands\u2019 aggressive marketing and sales campaigns in Europe indicate that the companies believe consumers there who have traditionally used iPhones will do the same thing.ImageA smartphone retail and repair mall in Beijing. Apple sits atop the Chinese market for the highest-end handsets, but companies like Huawei and Oppo have improved their products in ways that are enticing wealthy Chinese buyers.CreditGilles Sabri\u00e9 for The New York Times\u201cMaybe it won\u2019t happen this year or next year,\u201d Mr. Jia said. \u201cBut Huawei is going in that direction.\u201dIn its pursuit of the European market, Huawei (pronounced \u201cHWA-way\u201d), which has its headquarters in Shenzhen and is now the world\u2019s No. 2 seller of smartphones, has gone far beyond the phone store. Huawei has sponsored summer concerts in Greece, teamed up with Lithuania\u2019s basketball federation and backed a \u201cChina Festival\u201d in Cologne, Germany. Vivo sponsored last year\u2019s World Cup in Russia.Xiaomi (pronounced \u201cSHAO-mee\u201d), which is based in Beijing and was founded in 2010, seemingly came out of nowhere to become the No. 4 mobile brand in Europe early last year, according to Canalys. The gadget maker has also become the top seller of phones in India, in part by opening hundreds of stores in rural areas.Cl\u00e9ment Blaise, a 25-year-old banker in northern France, has an iPhone for work and a Xiaomi as a personal phone. He said he needed to recharge the Apple device \u201call the time\u201d but could go two days without charging his Xiaomi.\u201cWe have this false, preconceived idea that Chinese brands are not as good, that their products are of cheap quality,\u201d Mr. Blaise said. \u201cBut the price gap leavens the fears. For 150 euros\u201d \u2014 around $170 \u2014 \u201cwhat do you risk anyway?\u201dChinese phone makers have not made similar inroads in the United States. The American government has worked for years to stymie the sale of Huawei\u2019s smartphones and telecom-network equipment, after a congressional inquiry in 2012 deemed Huawei a potential vehicle for cyberspying by the Chinese government. The Trump administration has urged Western allies to do the same.Security concerns have not dissuaded some buyers across the Atlantic. Giannis Vassilopoulos, a college student in Athens, said he had been bombarded by Huawei ads during his recent travels around Europe. He said he had bought a Huawei phone because the brand felt more familiar, more European even.\u201cSeeing Huawei in the middle of London makes it look immediately more Western,\u201d he said.Apple still has a hold on consumers in many places. Announcing the sales slump in China this week, the company\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said Apple expected to set revenue records in wealthier countries like Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, South Korea and Spain and in some emerging markets like Malaysia, Mexico, Poland and Vietnam.In China, though, Apple\u2019s market share has been declining, and the company is clinging to the No. 5 spot in smartphone shipments, according to the market research firm Counterpoint. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.China became the world\u2019s largest smartphone market over the past decade as rising incomes coincided with an explosion in mobile technology.People in China rely on handsets in an all-encompassing way, using them to rent bikes, sign into gyms and pay restaurant bills. The market is increasingly saturated, and there are fewer people in China who do not have an advanced device. But there are also new economic reasons to buy locally made goods: Consumers who are replacing or looking to upgrade are dialing back in light of China\u2019s slowdown.Today, mainland China\u2019s top smartphone seller is Huawei, whose handset line includes midrange devices and higher-end models with all the latest features. Vivo and Oppo, brands owned by the same Chinese parent company, are next. And then comes Xiaomi, whose phones, smart home devices and even sneakers command a passionate fan base.Samsung of South Korea, which sells more smartphones globally than any other brand, has only around 1 percent of the market in China.Feng Yin, a 32-year-old engineer, has an iPhone now, but he is considering switching to a Huawei device.ImageMobile phones on sale at Sin Tat Plaza, in Mong Kok, Hong Kong. Chinese phone makers have not made inroads in the United States similar to those they have made elsewhere.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York Times\u201cIn the past few years, the technology in Apple\u2019s phones has not had any big breakthroughs, while the technology in domestic phones has gotten better and better,\u201d he said while browsing in a Huawei store in Shanghai on Friday. \u201cThe difference is getting smaller.\u201dApple products have long been seen in China as conferring on their owners the ultimate in cachet and cool. But Chinese companies have used slick marketing and celebrity endorsements in hopes of giving their products more personality, while promoting advances in camera technology, battery life and microchips.On Friday, Xian Longfei, a restaurant chef, and a friend were at an Oppo store in Shanghai. When it comes to cellphone brands, Mr. Xian, 35, has tried many: Nokia, Motorola, Samsung and three different iPhone models. He switched to an Oppo a few months ago.He acknowledges that Apple\u2019s devices still seem better on the whole. But so many of his friends in Shanghai and people in his hometown are Oppo users. And the price \u2014 around $400 on sale \u2014 was hard to beat.Also, he said, holding up his pink handset, \u201cthe form factor is pretty.\u201dAnother factor working against Apple in China is the dominance of WeChat, a messaging, social media and payments app used by more than a billion people. It works on Google\u2019s Android operating system as well as Apple\u2019s, making a phone\u2019s software less of a differentiating factor.\u201cWhy would people pay such a high price for an iPhone,\u201d asked Kiranjeet Kaur, an analyst for the industry research firm IDC, \u201cif, from a hardware perspective, there isn\u2019t much of an upgrade from Huawei and, from a platform perspective, there\u2019s nothing to lock people in?\u201dIn Europe, buyers of Chinese brands describe undergoing a sort of conversion. Irritating flaws in their iPhone or Samsung devices lead them to seek alternatives. Presented with unfamiliar Chinese products, they initially have doubts. But after a while, they get hooked.ImageXiaomi\u2019s flagship store in Mong Kok.

He has turned his 56-year-old aunt, Christine Jankowski, into a believer, too.\u201cI wasn\u2019t really worried about the fact that it was a Chinese brand,\u201d Ms. Jankowski said of her Huawei phone. She added: \u201cWe know that they make amazing technological products.\u201cIf I had to buy a Chinese frying pan, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut a phone?\u201d"}, {"title": "Los Angeles Accuses Weather Channel App of Covertly Mining User Data", "category": "Business", "id": "81a863cf-c2a7-4915-99d2-328d6bf7cd6f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/technology/weather-channel-app-lawsuit.html", "publishdate": 20190104, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/04/business/04location3/04location3-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The Weather Channel app deceptively collected, shared and profited from the location information of millions of American consumers, the city attorney of Los Angeles said in a lawsuit filed on Thursday.One of the most popular online weather services in the United States, the Weather Channel app has been downloaded more than 100 million times and has 45 million active users monthly.The government said the Weather Company, the business behind the app, unfairly manipulated users into turning on location tracking by implying that the information would be used only to localize weather reports. Yet the company, which is owned by IBM, also used the data for unrelated commercial purposes, like targeted marketing and analysis for hedge funds, according to the lawsuit.ImageThe lawsuit accuses the Weather Channel of manipulating users by implying that tracking data would be used only to localize weather reports.Credit The city\u2019s lawsuit cited an article last month in The New York Times that detailed a sprawling industry of companies that profit from continuously snooping on users\u2019 precise whereabouts. The companies collect location data from smartphone apps to cater to advertisers, stores and investors seeking insights into consumer behavior.The Times found that at least 75 companies collected precise location data \u2014 on at least one occasion logging a person\u2019s whereabouts more than 14,000 times in just one day. Yet many of the pop-up notices that apps showed to prompt consumers to enable location services only partly disclosed how their data would be shared and used. The Los Angeles lawsuit says such incomplete messages are \u201cfraudulent and deceptive\u201d and violate California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law.\u201cIf the price of getting a weather report is going to be the sacrifice of your most personal information about where you spend your time day and night,\u201d said Michael N.

The city said that the company failed to sufficiently disclose its data practices when it got users\u2019 permission to track their location and that it obscured other tracking details in its privacy policy.\u201cThese issues certainly aren\u2019t limited to our state,\u201d Mr. Feuer said. \u201cIdeally this litigation will be the catalyst for other action \u2014 either litigation or legislative activity \u2014 to protect consumers\u2019 ability to assure their private information remains just that, unless they speak clearly in advance.\u201dThe suit seeks civil penalties of up to $2,500 for each violation of the Unfair Competition Law. In such cases, a judge determines the number of violations and amount of the penalties.

Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Friday that low inflation would allow the Fed to be \u201cpatient\u201d in deciding whether to continue raising interest rates, a message welcomed by jittery investors.The Fed is confronting an increasingly uncertain economic outlook. Falling stock prices, weakening global growth and concerns about President Trump\u2019s economic policies have set investors on edge and prompted warnings that the economic expansion is nearing its end. But measures of domestic economic activity remain strong, including Friday\u2019s report the economy added 312,000 jobs in December.Mr. Powell\u2019s message on Friday was that the Fed can afford to watch and wait. He said the best available evidence suggested that the economy was still in good shape. But he also was at pains to reassure investors unsettled by his confident tone at his last news conference, in mid-December. He said that the Fed was watching for evidence of weakness, and that the health of the economy would ultimately determine the course of policy.\u201cWith the muted inflation readings that we\u2019ve seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves,\u201d Mr. Powell said. The Fed predicted in December that it would raise rates twice in 2019, but Mr. Powell said the central bank was ready to change course \u201csignificantly if necessary.\u201dThe stock market, driven down on Thursday by concerns about growth, surged on Friday on the strength of the jobs data, and then kept climbing as Mr. Powell spoke. Investors who are worried about the growing economic impact of a trade war with China also hoped for progress toward a resolution when the Trump administration and Chinese officials hold meetings next week.The S&P 500 rose 84.05 points to close at 2,531.94; the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose 0.11 points to close at 2.668 percent.[Read more: The jobs data, and signs of flexibility at the Fed, helped stocks soar on Friday.]Mr. Powell also defended the Fed\u2019s autonomy on Friday in the face of sharp attacks by Mr. Trump, who has complained to aides that the Fed\u2019s rate increases would undermine economic growth and \u201cturn me into Hoover,\u201d a reference to the president during the Great Depression\u2019s early years.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers, alarmed by his inquiries as to whether he has the power to fire Mr. Powell, want to arrange a meeting between the two men. Mr. Powell, under questioning by Neil Irwin, an economics writer at The New York Times, said that he was open to meeting with Mr. Trump, as Fed chairs have done with past presidents, but that no meeting had been scheduled.He also said the Fed would make policy without regard to Mr. Trump\u2019s views. \u201cI want the public to be assured that we have a strong culture, it\u2019s not a fragile one, it\u2019s not being disrupted,\u201d he said.Asked if he would resign if Mr. Trump asked him to do so, Mr. Powell replied directly: \u201cNo.\u201dMr. Powell was joined onstage at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association by his immediate predecessors at the Fed, Janet L. Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke. Both of them criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks as potentially damaging to the central bank, and therefore to the economy.Strong economic growth fueled the Fed\u2019s decision to raise its benchmark rate four times in 2018, into a range from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. The rate, which had hovered near zero in the wake of the financial crisis a decade earlier, now sits at the lower end of the range that Fed officials consider a reasonable estimate of \u201cneutrality,\u201d meaning that the central bank is neither encouraging nor discouraging economic growth.Fed officials say the continued strength of the economy validates their management of monetary policy. \u201cI think we\u2019re actually in a good spot,\u201d Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CNBC on Friday, noting that job growth is strong and inflation is under control.But critics, including Mr. Trump, have said the economy still needs the Fed\u2019s help. Inflation remains below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as optimal, suggesting that the economy has room to grow, and workers are only beginning to reap the benefits of an expansion now in its 10th year.Clouds also are gathering on the economic horizon. The Trump administration increased economic growth last year through large tax cuts and increased federal spending, but those benefits are waning. And Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with China is beginning to be felt by American companies, like Apple and FedEx, which have warned that the tit-for-tat tariffs are pinching profits. The Fed\u2019s decision to raise the benchmark rate at its most recent meeting, in mid-December, drove down stock prices and bond yields in a show of concern about the prospects for continued economic growth. Asset prices imply an expectation that the Fed will not raise interest rates at all during 2019.Mr. Powell began his remarks by reiterating his view that the markets\u2019 concerns are overstated. He said that 2018 had been \u201ca good year for the United States economy\u201d and that the latest economic data suggested \u201congoing momentum heading into 2019.\u201d Wall Street\u2019s pessimism, he said, is \u201cwell ahead of the data.\u201dBut the Fed chairman offered a different kind of relief to financial markets by emphasizing that the slow pace of inflation allows the Fed to postpone judgments about the resilience of the economic expansion.Inflation was 1.8 percent during the 12 months that ended in November, the most recent available data. It is likely that inflation remained soft in December, marking the seventh straight year that prices rose by less than 2 percent.And inflation would have been even weaker but for the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, according to a study published Friday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Mr. Trump has repeatedly argued that the cost of the tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, is being absorbed by Chinese exporters. But the study found that American consumers were paying a hefty price. The authors estimated that the tariffs added about 0.3 percentage points to the Consumer Price Index last year.Job growth has remained strong, and wage growth has increased in recent months, but Mr. Powell said the Fed was on guard against rising prices, not rising wages. He said the strength of the labor market \u201cdoes not raise concerns about too high inflation.\u201dMichael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said Mr. Powell\u2019s remarks convinced him that the Fed would move more slowly in 2019. Mr. Feroli previously predicted three rate increases in 2019; he said he now expected the Fed to raise rates twice, in July and December.\u201cPowell\u2019s message was unmistakable,\u201d Mr. Feroli wrote in a note to clients.Mr. Powell also sought to ease concerns in financial markets about the Fed\u2019s gradual reduction of its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it bought in large quantities during the financial crisis to help bolster the economy. Some analysts have argued that the Fed\u2019s retreat is exacerbating the current volatility in financial markets.Mr. Powell said that the Fed disagreed but, returning to his theme for the day, that it was watching closely and willing to change its mind.\u201cIf we ever came to the conclusion that any aspect of our plans was somehow interfering with our attainment of our statutory goals, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to change it,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "Republicans Seek to Boost Small Donations, but a Fragmented System Stymies Them", "category": "Politics", "id": "dfe1a948-4f91-4e07-bc40-e778efd1fbb6", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/republican-campaign-donations.html", "publishdate": 20190104, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/06/us/politics/06donate-print/merlin_146386863_f403afcb-a6c2-4501-9852-fdfe0c77ce28-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Last year at this time, Republicans feared the \u201cblue wave,\u201d a surge of voter enthusiasm for Democrats in the midterm elections.With the election over, and the fears of Republicans partly realized, the party\u2019s worry has shifted to the \u201cgreen wave:\u201d $39.67 here, $39.67 there.That\u2019s the average donation to ActBlue, the online fund-raising hub used by more than 90 percent of Democrats. Buoyed by ActBlue, more than 100 Democratic candidates outraised their Republican counterparts in hotly contested congressional races.That kind of uniformity and heft in small-dollar donations \u2014 typically defined as $200 or less \u2014 was missing on the Republican side, a costly shortcoming that the party is now confronting after losing 40 seats, and control of the House, to Democrats.\u201cActBlue is something we\u2019re going to have to deal with,\u201d the Republican National Committee chairwoman, Ronna Romney McDaniel, said recently.Republicans still receive streams of money from super pacs financed by big donors like the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, and through individual donors who send larger amounts. And the Republican National Committee exceeded the Democratic National Committee in fund-raising in the cycle nearly two to one. In addition, President Trump\u2019s campaign is known for its prolific fund-raisingBut individual Democratic candidates for House and Senate seats outraised their Republican counterparts overall, $1.4 billion to $880 million and a significant portion of the difference can be attributed to small donations whose impact has increased significantly.Overall, Democratic candidates in the general election collected nearly $296 million in small donations, more than three times the $85 million collected by Republicans. As Democrats have increasingly excelled in that area, aided by ActBlue, Republicans have come to realize that those little donations, repeated over and over again, add up to big numbers.ImageLauren Underwood, a Democrat, ousted the incumbent Republican representative, Randy Hultgren, in Illinois after collecting nearly $1.2 million in small donations, 15 times more than Mr. Hultgren.CreditErin Schaff for The New York Times\u201cWe simply can\u2019t go to the next election cycle as underfunded as we were compared to the Democratic candidates in the target races,\u201d Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out a way to even out that funding situation.\u201dBut Republicans cannot simply copy the Democratic model. While ActBlue is a nonprofit, Republican efforts at collecting small-dollar donations are fragmented among for-profit processing vendors. There are more than a half-dozen such vendors servicing Republican candidates and committees. And there is big money to be made from their portion of the processing fees, typically around 4 percent, some of which goes to banks and credit card companies.The companies\u2019 makeup reflects the small world of online political fund-raising and the connections between some vendors and powerful forces within the party, which could complicate efforts to streamline and centralize the system.Among the three main players, for instance, one has ties to the Republican National Committee and counts President Trump\u2019s campaign as a client. A principal in another company is the brother of the digital director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee; and the founder of the third, a former congressional candidate himself, processes donations for most of the state parties as well as many influential members of Congress.In a tweet that highlighted how competing interests and fiefs could impede a solution, one Republican consultant, Tim Cameron, posted a photo of the actor Mel Gibson and a line from his movie Braveheart: \u201cUnite the Clans.\u201dThat was in response to a tweet in October from Gerrit Lansing, the founder of one of the top Republican processing vendors, Revv. He called ActBlue the \u201csingle largest advantage\u201d of the Democrats, promoting his company as a solution.There are efforts at the national party level to streamline funding. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has initiated discussions about a possible merger or information-sharing arrangement among vendors.Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff for Mr. McConnell who is advising his office on the issue, contacted several companies recently to discuss a solution, the vendors said.Several Republican consultants and fund-raising experts, though, warned that fixing the operational bugs won\u2019t completely solve the problem.ImageActBlue says it helped raise $1.6 billion in the 2017-18 election cycle with an average donation of $39.67.CreditJessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe, via Getty Images\u201cI think a lot of it is historical legacy, where Republicans traditionally have relied on a smaller number of larger donors,\u201d said David Nickerson, who teaches political science at Temple University. Democrats have built a tradition of small-dollar donation, he said. \u201cIt has become part of the culture.\u201dThere is some evidence that is beginning to change, with Mr. Trump\u2019s populist appeal energizing Republican small donors. Enthusiasm at the presidential level, though, has not transferred to individual Senate and House Republican candidates, who have fallen way behind Democrats.\u201cTrump sucks up all the oxygen. People are giving to Trump and now they\u2019re done,\u201d said Guy Short, vice president of fund-raising for Campaign Solutions, another significant player in the industry. \u201cUnfortunately, we haven\u2019t been able to translate that down the ballot.\u201dThe fund-raising gap was particularly notable in close and hotly contested races, with Democrats making inroads into previously conservative districts and suburban areas, a grim sign for Republicans.In Virginia, for example, the Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger collected more than $1.5 million from small donors \u2014 double the total for the Republican incumbent, Dave Brat, who lost his seat. In Illinois, Lauren Underwood ousted the incumbent Republican Randy Hultgren from his district near Chicago after collecting nearly $1.2 million from small donors, 15 times more than Mr. Hultgren. And in Oklahoma City, Kendra Horn defeated incumbent Republican Steve Russell after collecting 10 times more from small donors.ActBlue said it helped raise $1.6 billion in the 2017-18 election cycle, including money it collects for interest groups and state candidates. The average donation was $39.67.In House races, the organization said, more than half the money from individual contributors to Democratic candidates was raised through ActBlue.The site\u2019s influence and fund-raising have grown exponentially in the past several years, aided by Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s appeal to small donors in 2016 and his campaign\u2019s decision to use ActBlue. The service also collects a fee that it uses to pay banks and credit-card companies, and rolls the rest back into operations.In addition to providing Democratic donors with a one-stop site, ActBlue allows them to store their credit card numbers and, with one click, donate to virtually any Democratic candidate or liberal cause through a process called ActBlue Express, which the group says has 5.8 million users.ImageSenator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, is trying to streamline competing Republican-focused fund-raising sites to rival the small-dollar efficiency of the Democrats.CreditErin Schaff for The New York Times\u201cRight now as a Republican donor, you have to go to multiple websites,\u201d said Mr. Mackowiak, the strategist. \u201cIf you have someone who is motivated for one reason or another to give, you want that person to be able to contribute to as many races as possible.\u201dMr. Holmes, the former aide to Mr. McConnell, suggested that industry players might consolidate or forge a sharing arrangement to make donations easier. But several Republicans said they would not support the party picking one vendor as a central clearinghouse for donations, calling it antithetical to Republican philosophy.Instead, an agreement might work like this: A visitor to Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign site clicks to make a donation, which is processed by Anedot, a Dallas-based company owned by Paul Dietzel, a 2014 Republican congressional candidate, that provides services to Mr. McConnell and the campaigns of other Republicans.The donation is processed, with Anedot collecting the fee. The site would then ask the donor\u2019s permission to share his name and credit card information with other G.O.P. fund-raising vendors.When that donor decides to send money to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the system would recognize him and quickly process the information \u2014 much in the same way that ActBlue Express works \u2014 even though N.R.C.C. donations are processed through another vendor, Victory Passport.Still, this kind of workaround illustrates the challenges Republicans face in unifying their donation system.Mr. Lansing, the founder of Revv, said it would be technologically difficult to share information among the three most frequently used systems because two of them \u2014 Revv and Victory Passport \u2014 are built on top of Stripe, the large payments platform company, while Anedot is a stand-alone system.All of which makes ActBlue\u2019s uniform processing operation look more appealing.Matt Gorman, communications director for the N.R.C.C., said the committee has been reviewing small-dollar donations for more than a year, focusing on ActBlue.\u201cWe\u2019re reviewing its practices, how they go about their business, where the money goes, how they get their money and how we can bring some of the practices we find helpful to the Republican side,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "Wells Fargo Should Be More Generous With Federal Workers.

After years of cheating its customers, the bank has a golden opportunity to make good on its promises. Since the federal government shutdown began two weeks ago, credit unions that serve large populations of furloughed and unpaid workers have offered their members short-term interest-free loans, a variety of fee waivers and increased lines of credit.But Wells Fargo is not stuffing its Twitter feed or news release list with any such offers. Instead, it\u2019s offering up a few sentences on its website that say that the bank will \u201cwork with\u201d affected federal employees and that some borrowers \u201cmay\u201d qualify for forbearance.On Friday evening, the bank told me that it would automate fee waivers for federal employees with direct deposit \u2014 a big step in the right direction. But Wells Fargo was slow to take that step, and did so only after I spent two days asking it about what it was doing to help federal employees. It could \u2014 and should \u2014 be doing more, given its stated desire to make amends for bad behavior. This is a bank, after all, that has spent years fighting off or settling charges that it:Opened credit-card and other accounts that customers had not actually requested.Changed the terms of customers\u2019 mortgages without their authorization.Charged auto loan customers for insurance they did not need.Signed customers up for life insurance without their knowledge.This is an incomplete list \u2014 a lowlight reel \u2014 but the overall picture is of an institution that no one should trust. Wells Fargo knows this. It has devoted a whole section of its website to \u201cBuilding a Better Bank,\u201d complete with a long (very long) timeline outlining the steps it has taken so far.What is noticeably missing, however, are concrete offers of tangible financial value to its overall customer base. It stubbornly refuses to offer industry-beating savings account rates or credit card rewards, as I\u2019ve written in the past. Instead, we get airy reassurances about things that we can\u2019t easily measure, like \u201cbranch experience.\u201dSo why wasn\u2019t it obvious to the bank that it should be first and most generous in this extremely public showdown, which has caught about 800,000 blameless federal workers in the middle? Credit unions managed to figure it out quite quickly.At Navy Federal Credit Union, affected members who have already set up direct deposit are eligible for zero-percent loans up to $6,000. They\u2019ll repay them immediately and automatically when paychecks resume. \u201cWe are member-owned, and servicing members is kind of in the fabric of what we do,\u201d said Tynika Wilson, senior vice president of debit card and fund services.State Department Federal Credit Union will waive interest for two months on balances on a new credit card for affected people and offer several fee waivers. This could get expensive: The institution has calculated that more than half of its members could feel the effects of the shutdown, especially if they don\u2019t get the paychecks that would start arriving on Jan. 11.Big banks have more resources and don\u2019t have as high a percentage of customers who are facing the prospect of no federal paycheck. So why can\u2019t they make similar loans? \u201cThat is probably a great question for you to ask them,\u201d said Bill Thorla, chief operating officer of the State Department credit union.Bank of America wouldn\u2019t comment when I asked about zero-interest loans. JPMorgan Chase does not offer personal loans. Citibank isn\u2019t offering any in this instance. If any national banks are doing so, please raise a hand.For-profit financial services firms are not heartless. American Express, Chase and Discover said that if eligible federal employees contact them first and explain their circumstances, there may be ways to put off debt payment for a month and not pay interest or fees while avoiding negative credit report repercussions. Citi says it is offering fee waivers, but the home page of its personal banking site makes no mention of its efforts. Bank of America has a general assistance program where people temporarily in trouble can ask the bank to cancel certain charges and make other modifications. (It has no website, but you can call 844-219-0690 for help.)Banks are rarely cuddly, but there is no close reading of the government shutdown assistance page on Wells Fargo\u2019s site that doesn\u2019t feel conditional, lawyered and a wee bit stingy given its recent history. The bank dangles \u201cforbearance\u201d \u2014 a word that generally suggests mere toleration, but is specifically dirty if you\u2019ve learned about it the hard way: when your student loan interest kept piling up while you took a timeout from payments.On Thursday, I began to pry a bit more information out of the bank\u2019s spokesman, Tom Goyda. He confirmed that there were no zero-interest loans available, so the bank can\u2019t match the credit unions there. He was concerned, given how different each individual customer\u2019s circumstances may be, that other promises of relief might feel misleading. But he did allow that there may be some situations where the bank could do what American Express, Chase and Discover say they are willing to do: help federal employees who might not be able to make their payments.As of Thursday, the site said the bank \u201cwill consider reversing overdraft/non-sufficient funds fees for individual and business banking customers whose income is disrupted as a result of the shutdown\u201d \u2014 making it sound as if its customers must be supplicants.By Friday, that statement had been replaced. Instead, the site said Wells Fargo \u201cwill work with\u201d that same group, without the word \u201cconsider.\u201d The site no longer mentioned specific fees at all, but Mr. Goyda said the change did not mean the bank would not still try to help with those charges. Then Friday evening, about 90 minutes after this column was published online, another update: The bank said it would automatically reverse monthly service fees and overdraft or insufficient-fund fees for employees of affected government agencies who were signed up for direct deposit of paychecks as of November. It will also work with people who do not have direct deposit. This automatic assistance, if it works, would make Wells Fargo a leader among big banks in assisting these workers. Chase made a similar offer Dec. 22.But in not going as far as the credit unions \u2014 or besting them \u2014 is Wells Fargo missing an opportunity to win over a skeptical public? \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of work over the past few years to re-establish trust and build a better bank,\u201d Mr. Goyda said in an email on Thursday, \u201cand the fact that we have programs available to address just these kinds of customer situations \u2014 fortunately not generally on such a large scale \u2014 is a reflection of our larger commitment to helping customers whenever they experience financial challenges.\u201dThat all sounds nice. But someday soon, I hope to write about a consumer-facing Wells Fargo initiative that arrives sooner and is better than anyone else\u2019s. It\u2019s a shame that in its yearslong saga of scandal and attempted rehabilitation, it hasn\u2019t yet seen fit to simply be generous."}, {"title": "This Expert Called the Market Plunge.

The Dow had just gained 25 percent in 2017, and the Nasdaq had leapt 28 percent. Volatility was so low that there wasn\u2019t a single day in 2017 when the S&P 500 fluctuated more than 2 percent.Not everyone was celebrating.\u201cIf there are any certainties, one will be that this party will eventually come to an end,\u201d James Stack, president of InvesTech Research, told me a year ago. \u201cAnd when it ends, it will end badly, and with high volatility.\u201dMr. Stack turned out to be right. He lowered his recommended asset allocation for United States stocks from 82 percent last January to 72 percent in September, when stocks hit new all-time highs. He urged investors to raise cash in October, and at the end of November he recommended an even more defensive posture \u2014 including putting money in a fund whose value would rise when stock prices dropped. That brought his recommended net exposure to stocks to just 55 percent, the lowest since the depths of the last bear market in early 2009.Stocks plunged in December, posting their worst monthly loss since the financial crisis and the worst December since 1931 and the Great Depression.Yet most economic indicators are benign. Unemployment is an exceptionally low 3.7 percent. Wages are rising. Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target. The Fed raised rates a quarter point in December, citing \u201ca very healthy economy.\u201dGiven Mr. Stack\u2019s track record last year, I reached out to him this week for his current views. Even though valuations have come down and macroeconomic indicators \u201chave remained remarkably strong,\u201d he said, he\u2019s still defensive and hasn\u2019t changed his bearish allocation. He believes that the worst isn\u2019t over and that the Dow and S&P 500 will soon be down 20 percent from their peaks, retreating into a bear market. (The Nasdaq Composite and the Wilshire 2000 index of small-cap stocks are already there.)And that was before a revenue warning from Apple sent markets into another steep fall on Thursday.\u201cA lesson from history is that the market leads the economy by a lot longer than investors realize,\u201d Mr. Stack said. If the economy is headed toward recession, as the latest stock market declines suggest it may be, \u201cwe won\u2019t see the first economic warning signs until the first three to five months\u201d of 2019. Among the leading indicators he\u2019s watching for signs of weakness are consumer confidence, housing starts and unemployment claims.On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index, a leading indicator of industrial activity, fell sharply. That suggests that \u201cserious cracks\u201d are starting to appear in the economy, Mr. Stack said.Mr. Stack is right that bear markets typically precede recessions by many months: CNBC calculated in 2016 that bear markets since World War II had begun on average about eight months before a recession. That means that if a bear market did begin after major indexes peaked last fall, a recession might not start until June or even later. Even then, recessions are often over before economic data confirms their existence.That\u2019s when bear markets are, in fact, followed by recessions, which often isn\u2019t the case. As the economist Paul Samuelson famously said, \u201cThe stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions.\u201dSince World War II, there have been 13 bear markets. They were followed within a year by a recession just seven times. As a predictor of recessions with just 54 percent accuracy, bear markets are little better than flipping a coin.Indeed, Mr. Stack\u2019s data show that two or more down years in a row are quite rare: There have been only four instances since 1928, suggesting that stocks may well be in positive territory by the end of 2019, even if a bear market does materialize in the meantime.Which is one reason the Wharton economist Jeremy Siegel told me that he\u2019s bullish on the stock market this year. He predicts it could rise between 5 percent and 15 percent, even if there is an economic slowdown.Stocks are much cheaper now than they were before the December sell-off. The ratio between stock prices and projected earnings for companies in the S&P 500 is about 17, down from over 19 a year ago and the lowest in the past five years.[Stocks rose Friday after the release of a strong December jobs report and comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve that the central bank would be flexible on raising interest rates this year.]Mr. Stack, however, argued that in the event of an economic downturn \u2014 or even a significant slowdown \u2014 \u201cthose projected earnings will go out the window.\u201d\u201cI would not call today\u2019s market undervalued,\u201d he added.Mr. Siegel bases his forecast of a market rally on the belief that the Fed will stop raising short-term interest rates. \u201cI think the Fed got the message from the markets that it should not have hiked in December,\u201d he said.Mr. Stack, too, said he was surprised the Fed raised rates in December. \u201cI think the Fed will stand down and put future rate increases on hold,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich could stabilize the market, at least for the time being.\u201dBut Mr. Stack\u2019s technical indicators are still pointing toward a bear market. He\u2019s also worried about the shaky housing market, with price drops and slowing sales showing up in major cities.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to time the market, but we\u2019re very comfortable with our defensive allocation,\u201d he said. Although he predicted higher volatility a year ago, he was nonetheless surprised by the extremes reached in December, without even \u201ca single hard warning sign of recession on the horizon.\u201d\u201cCan you imagine,\u201d he asked, \u201chow volatile it will be when we do have those warnings?\u201d"}, {"title": "Stocks Surge as Powell Signals Fed Flexibility and Jobs Data Eases Worries", "category": "Business", "id": "3c04618f-ad06-427d-b67f-d838c92e3b6f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/business/global-stock-markets.html", "publishdate": 20190104, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/05/business/05markets1/05markets1-articleLarge-v4.png", "content": "Stocks surged on Friday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H.

Employers in the United States added 312,000 jobs last month, well above Wall Street\u2019s expectations and the biggest monthly gain since February.The faint prospect that China and the United States were inching toward a resolution of their trade war also helped lift markets. China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said on Friday that Jeffrey Gerrish, the deputy United States trade representative, would lead a delegation to Beijing for trade talks next week.One of the biggest concerns for investors is how much the trade dispute between China and the United States will dent global growth. The meeting next week would be the first between the two sides since President Trump and President Xi Jinping called a 90-day truce in December.China also took steps to bolster its economy on Friday. The People\u2019s Bank of China said it would cut the amount of cash that banks have to hold as reserves against bad times, essentially freeing up about $218 billion.[U.S. employers added 312,000 jobs last month, capping a year of robust hiring.]Reflecting Friday\u2019s optimistic tone, crude oil prices also rose.

But a closer look shows signs of strain emerging on several fronts.Annual sales reached 17.3 million new cars and light trucks last year, a rise of 0.6 percent from 2017. It was the fourth year in a row that the figure exceeded 17 million, the longest such streak the industry has ever recorded.But last year\u2019s increase was driven by higher sales to rental, government and corporate fleets. Sales to individual consumers \u2014 considered a more accurate measure of demand \u2014 were flat, according to Edmunds, an auto-retail data provider.At the same time, the enticing loan deals that many car buyers rely on have started to disappear. Interest-free loans, for example, accounted for just 5.5 percent of all finance plans offered by dealers in December. That was the lowest level for December since 2005, according to Edmunds.Furthermore, sales in 2018 got a one-time lift from the Trump administration\u2019s tax overhaul, which gave some consumers extra income to spend on new cars. Automakers won\u2019t have that tailwind again.\u201cThis year is going to be tougher than last year,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at Alix Partners, a consulting firm, \u201cand the next year will even tougher than 2019.\u201dEven though total sales rose in 2018, signs of halting demand were clear, Mr. Wakefield said. While sales of small sport utility vehicles rose strongly last year, sales of most other types of vehicles were either down or up only slightly.\u201cOther than that one segment, there isn\u2019t a lot of growth,\u201d he said.In addition, Tesla\u2019s sales more than tripled in 2018, and without that increase, the industry would have reported a decline in sales. G.M., Ford and Toyota reported lower sales for a third year in a row. G.M.\u2019s domestic market share fell to 17 percent \u2014 its lowest level since the company\u2019s infancy a century ago.Most automakers posted gains early in 2018, with sales markedly weakening late in the year. G.M. reported a decline of 1.6 percent for the full year, but its estimated year-over-year decline for December was 3.7 percent. (The company no longer reports monthly sales.) Ford\u2019s sales fell 9 percent in December.Beyond the domestic market, automakers face other potential challenges. The potential tremors from an economic slowdown in China became more palpable this week as Apple slashed its financial forecast, citing disappointing iPhone sales there.Lower consumer spending in China could hurt G.M., Ford, Toyota and other automakers because they now depend on that country to drive global growth, and some reap considerable profits there. Ford is especially vulnerable because it has been losing money in China and is trying reorganize its operations there.Those concerns seemed distant in the upbeat remarks of officials on Thursday.Ford said any worries about a slowdown in China were not likely to be a factor in domestic demand. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly something we look at, as a global company,\u201d Emily Kolinski Morris, Ford\u2019s chief economist, said of the China outlook. But as far as the United States market, she said, \u201cI think consumers are looking at their personal financial situations.\u201dShe added that unemployment remained low and that surveys showed strong consumer confidence.Likewise, a Toyota executive played down the prospect of continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve \u2014 and tougher borrowing terms for car buyers.\u201cInterest rates are always going to be a concern at some level,\u201d Jack Hollis, a group vice president at Toyota\u2019s North American manufacturing arm, said in a conference call. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t slowed the industry to a point of concern.\u201dStill, Ford and G.M. are preparing for more difficult times. Both companies are cutting jobs and costs in North America. G.M. said in November that it was idling five North American plants and aiming to eliminate more than 14,000 blue- and white-collar jobs.Earlier in 2018, Ford announced a plan to reorganize its worldwide salaried work force of 70,000 with the goal of having a leaner staff by the second quarter of 2019. The move is expected to eliminate several thousand jobs.General Motors began the year with an executive appointment, naming Mark Reuss on Thursday as its resident. Mr. Reuss, the son of a former G.M. president, Lloyd Reuss, has been serving as the company\u2019s product development chief. He succeeds Dan Ammann, who was named chief executive of G.M. Cruise, a division developing self-driving cars.One thing that the economic outlook may not change is the continued American preference for larger vehicles. Slumping oil prices \u2014 at about half their level five years ago \u2014 have offered little motivation for buyers to make fuel economy a priority. And unless supplies are constrained, an economic slowdown should keep prices low."}, {"title": "5 Reasons You Wouldn\u2019t Want to Be in Tim Cook\u2019s Shoes Right Now", "category": "Business", "id": "cad0c6e9-0178-4038-a2bd-cc307d1e667f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/technology/apple-tim-cook-china.html", "publishdate": 20190104, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/05/business/05cook-print/merlin_143648598_b8e0a4e9-87bb-4c9c-b483-8dd70bdbcd2f-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Do not pity Timothy D. Cook. He has made hundreds of millions of dollars as Apple\u2019s chief executive. He is regarded as one of business\u2019s best bosses, and runs a company with a beloved brand and $130 billion in cash. Even so, he is hitting what could be the toughest time of his tenure in Apple\u2019s corner office, and his legacy as heir to Steve Jobs will be on the line. Here are five reasons:1. His bet on China may be backfiring. The signature innovation of Apple\u2019s late co-founder, Mr. Jobs, was the iPhone. Mr. Cook\u2019s has been his ability to crack the Chinese market. That strategy delivered hundreds of millions of new customers and helped make Apple the first private company to surpass $1 trillion in market value by August last year.But now it might be backfiring. The Chinese economy is sputtering, and the trade war between the United States and China isn\u2019t getting much better. With most adults \u2014 even children \u2014 in the developed world now owning one if not two smartphones, Apple has relied on China to keep growing. On Wednesday, Mr. Cook announced a potential drop of 25 percent in sales in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan in the most recent quarter. A sharp falloff like that suggests that Chinese consumers are following a trend in other emerging markets like India and Indonesia, where consumers have long passed over iPhones for cheaper, almost-as-good devices from Apple\u2019s competitors.Apple\u2019s share price dropped nearly 10 percent on Thursday, but bounced back about 4 percent on Friday.2. People are sticking with their old iPhones. People aren\u2019t buying iPhones the way they used to. With smartphones now in nearly every pocket in the developed world, new customers are hard to come by. So Apple has increasingly relied on enticing existing customers to toss their old iPhones for faster, slimmer, pricier successors. The problem is, many people aren\u2019t. Mr. Cook said this week that customers were waiting longer to replace their iPhones, with many instead swapping in new batteries to extend their life. Apple fueled that trend when it cut the price of battery swaps to $29 from $79 in response to revelations that its software slowed down iPhones with old batteries.That presents a dilemma for Mr. Cook. Apple wants iPhones to be durable and long lasting so consumers will see them as worthy investments. (Many now cost more than a refrigerator.) Apple also knows that the longer consumers use their iPhone, the more they pay for apps and Apple services, a rapidly growing and increasingly important part of Apple\u2019s business. But the ugly truth might be: Longer-lasting iPhones are bad for business.3. President Trump knows where iPhones are made. Apple\u2019s sophisticated supply chain is among the great wonders of modern business, incorporating hundreds of suppliers in a complex web of factories and shippers to keep up with global demand for one of history\u2019s most popular products. And Mr. Cook, who was Apple\u2019s operations guru before he became chief executive, is largely credited with its creation.But it soon might be in the cross hairs of President Trump. Apple, one of the quintessential American brands, assembles most of its products in China \u2014 and Mr. Trump has noticed. He criticized Apple on the campaign trail, saying he\u2019d force it to start making its products closer to home. While president, he has said Apple plans \u201cto build a lot of plants\u201d in the United States \u2014 even though it hasn\u2019t announced plans to do so. (Mr. Cook hasn\u2019t publicly corrected him.)While Apple avoided an iPhone tax in the first rounds of tariffs, it might not be so lucky if Mr. Trump is looking for more products to target. If that happens, Apple will be in a pickle. Its supply chain is entrenched in China, and finding another country that can match China\u2019s scale and skill in the labor market will be difficult. The iPhone is also already among the world\u2019s most expensive phones. Increasing the price to pay for tariffs would most likely scare away even more buyers.Cozying up to the president to spare Apple products from tariffs also risks angering Apple\u2019s employees in liberal Silicon Valley \u2014 even some of its customers. So far, Mr. Cook has walked a fine line, holding cordial private meetings with Mr. Trump while also publicly criticizing his policies, without drawing the ire of the president or Apple employees.On Friday, speaking to reporters at the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Trump reiterated that he wanted Apple to move manufacturing to the United States.\u201cDon\u2019t forget this: Apple makes their product in China,\u201d he said. \u201cI told Tim Cook, who is a friend of mine and who I like a lot: \u2018Make your product in the United States. Build those big, beautiful plants that go on for miles, it seems. Build those plants in the United States.\u2019\u201dHe went on to say China, not the United States, gets the biggest benefit from Apple. \u201cThey build their product mostly in China.\u201dImageOutside an Apple store in Beijing. Until recently, the Chinese market was a major source of growth in iPhone sales. CreditGilles Sabri\u00e9 for The New York Times4. Apple has clammed up on iPhone unit sales.Two months ago, Mr. Cook slipped a wonky announcement into Apple\u2019s earnings call: The company would no longer disclose how many iPhones, Macs and iPads it sold. \u201cThe number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business,\u201d he reasoned.Apple had reported the metric for years, highlighting tremendous growth in iPhone sales. But those sales have leveled off over the last two quarters. In an earnings call at the end of January, Mr. Cook will probably tell investors that the iPhone business is slowing. How much? That will be up to people outside the company to figure out. Investors were displeased \u2014 even before the surprise news about sales in China. Apple\u2019s shares have since dropped more than 30 percent, shaving $380 billion off its market value. The most valuable public company in the world not long ago is now worth less than longtime rivals Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company.5. Innovation is hard to do over and over again.Mr. Jobs presided over a historic run of innovation in his second tour at Apple, from the iMac to the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad. In his seven years as chief executive, Mr. Cook has announced the Apple Watch and AirPods, which have done well but have been far from iPhone-like industry changers.So what\u2019s next? That is Mr. Cook\u2019s biggest challenge.Apple has been working on artificial intelligence and self-driving car technology \u2014 but most industry insiders believe it is way behind competitors like Alphabet. Then there is the world of digital health, where Apple would face intense regulations and bureaucracy. Or maybe Apple will try to build glasses that overlay a digital interface on what people see. That technology, called augmented reality, faces enormous technical hurdles \u2014 as well as the challenge of getting people to wear a computer on their face. Think of a (hopefully) stylish version of Google\u2019s oft-mocked Google Glass.Whatever he does, Mr. Cook faces enormous expectations. It takes a lot to fuel growth at a company that had $265.6 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year.The Apple Watch dominates the market for wearable technology and would be a smash hit for any other company. For Apple? Watches have been counted in the \u201cother products\u201d category in financial results."}, {"title": "Does It Pay to Be a Writer?", "category": "Business", "id": "7c6b5670-3581-4924-b6e0-8e4e0345ef8a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/books/authors-pay-writer.html", "publishdate": 20190105, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/07/books/07item-writerspay-print/03item-writerspay-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Writing has never been a lucrative career choice, but a recent study by the Authors Guild, a professional organization for book writers, shows that it may not even be a livable one anymore.According to the survey results, the median pay for full-time writers was $20,300 in 2017, and that number decreased to $6,080 when part-time writers were considered. The latter figure reflects a 42 percent drop since 2009, when the median was $10,500. These findings are the result of an expansive 2018 study of more than 5,000 published book authors, across genres and including both traditional and self-published writers.\u201cIn the 20th century, a good literary writer could earn a middle-class living just writing,\u201d said Mary Rasenberger, executive director of the Authors Guild, citing William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Cheever. Now, most writers need to supplement their income with speaking engagements or teaching. Strictly book-related income \u2014 which is to say royalties and advances \u2014 are also down, almost 30 percent for full-time writers since 2009.Writing for magazines and newspapers was once a solid source of additional income for professional writers, but the decline in freelance journalism and pay has meant less opportunity for authors to write for pay. Many print publications, which offered the highest rate, have been shuttered altogether.The decline in earnings is also largely because of Amazon\u2019s lion\u2019s share of the self-publishing, e-book and resale market, Ms. Rasenberger said. The conglomerate charges commission and marketing fees to publishers that Ms. Rasenberger said essentially prevent their books from being buried on the site. Small and independent publishers, which have fewer resources and bargaining power, have been particularly hard hit. Book publishing companies are passing these losses along to writers in the form of lower royalties and advances, and authors also lose out on income from books resold on the platform.In some ways, these changes are in line with a general shift toward a gig economy or \u201chustling,\u201d in which people juggle an assortment of jobs to make up for the lack of a stable income. But the writing industry as a whole has always eluded standardization in pay. In a conversation with Manjula Martin in the book \u201cScratch: Writers, Money, and the Art of Making a Living,\u201d edited by Ms. Martin, Cheryl Strayed said, \u201cThere\u2019s no other job in the world where you get your master\u2019s degree in that field and you\u2019re like, \u2018Well, I might make zero or I might make $5 million!\u2019\u201dIn a recent call, Ms. Martin said that \u201cthe people who are able to practice the trade of authoring are people who have other sources of income,\u201d adding that this creates barriers of entry and limits the types of stories that reach a wide audience. There is also, she added, a devaluation of writing in which it is often viewed as a hobby as opposed to a valuable vocation.\u201cEveryone thinks they can write, because everybody writes,\u201d Ms. Rasenberger said, referring to the proliferation of casual texting, emailing and tweeting. But she distinguishes these from professional writers \u201cwho have been working on their craft and art of writing for years.\u201d\u201cWhat a professional writer can convey in written word is far superior to what the rest of us can do,\u201d Ms. Rasenberger said. \u201cAs a society we need that, because it\u2019s a way to crystallize ideas, make us see things in a new way and create understanding of who we are as a people, where we are today and where we\u2019re going.\u201d"}, {"title": "As Fires Ravaged California, Utilities Lobbied Lawmakers for Protection", "category": "Business", "id": "32c80d85-4b56-42f6-984b-ccded99ea080", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/business/energy-environment/california-wildfire-electric.html", "publishdate": 20190105, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/business/03utility01/merlin_146602416_06448eed-a695-4ce4-80fc-f9ed0ebb0e42-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 As California\u2019s deadliest wildfire was consuming the town of Paradise in November, some of the state\u2019s top power company officials and a dozen legislators were at an annual retreat at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort on Maui. In the course of four days, they discussed wildfires \u2014 and how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the devastation, if any.It is an issue of increasing urgency as more fires are traced to equipment owned by California\u2019s investor-owned utilities. The largest, Pacific Gas and Electric, could ultimately have to pay homeowners and others an estimated $30 billion for causing fires over the last two years. The most devastating of those, the Camp Fire, destroyed thousands of homes in Paradise and killed at least 86 people.Realizing that their potential fire liability is large enough to bankrupt them, the utility companies are spending tens of millions of dollars on lobbying and campaign contributions. Their goal: a California law that would allow them to pass on the cost of wildfires to their customers in the form of higher electricity rates. After an earlier lobbying push, legislators have already voted to protect the companies from having to bear the cost of 2017 fires, and utilities are seeking the same for 2018.The utility companies acknowledge that they may bear some responsibility but say not all of it, because climate change and development in remote areas have made wildfires more destructive. In addition, they argue that electricity rates would go up regardless of whether the state protected them because investors and banks could grow wary of lending to California\u2019s energy sector.But public interest groups say the utilities are effectively seeking a bailout for mistakes made by well-compensated executives. The utilities have been frequently criticized, for example, for not trimming trees along power lines. Some policy experts and lawmakers say it might be better to break up PG&E, replace its board and management or convert it into a publicly owned utility.People on both sides fear that the state, which prides itself on being a leader in the fight against climate change, could be on the cusp of an energy crisis \u2014 its second in less than two decades. In 2000 and 2001, California was roiled by blackouts, soaring electricity rates and the bankruptcy of PG&E after the state made missteps in deregulating the power industry.\u201cThere clearly is a great deal of disruption that would occur,\u201d said Assemblyman Chris Holden, chairman of the Utilities and Energy Committee. He was referring to the possibility of a second bankruptcy of PG&E, which serves 16 million people in central and Northern California.Just two months before the Camp Fire, PG&E seemed to have solved its most pressing problem: protecting its shareholders from footing the bill for the 2017 wildfires. On the typical bill of $100 a month, the company estimates, a customer would pay an additional $5 for every $1 billion the utility borrowed to cover damages.The companies waged a multimillion-dollar campaign to secure that protection. In the first nine months of 2018, the three investor-owned utilities collectively gave $5 million to the campaigns of state lawmakers, as much as $1 million more than they had in any full year since 2011, according to Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy organization in California.ImagePacific Gas & Electric crews working on power lines in Paradise, Calif. The company faces an estimated $30 billion in damages from two years of wildfires.CreditRich Pedroncelli/Associated PressPG&E stepped up its lobbying effort, too \u2014 spending $8.4 million in just the first nine months of 2018, compared with $1.6 million in all of 2017 and $1.1 million in 2016. The company\u2019s spending in the first three quarters exceeded 2017\u2019s top spender, Chevron, which spent $8.2 million that year, according to Consumer Watchdog.\u201cMoney talks in Sacramento, and big money talks loud enough to buy a big bailout,\u201d said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. \u201cThere is no legislator of either party, even those who don\u2019t take money from the utilities, who doesn\u2019t worry about bucking the utilities.\u201dConsumer groups say the efforts to protect utilities are particularly galling because Californians already pay more for power than people in other Western states. The state\u2019s residential electricity prices are between 19 percent and 40 percent higher than in neighboring Arizona, Nevada and Oregon.Events like the Maui conference have provided fodder for the industry\u2019s critics.The annual event is organized by the California Independent Voter Project, a nonprofit in San Diego that was co-founded by a former state senator and says it informs the public about policy issues. The event brings together legislators and executives from several industries, who pay $8,000 a head to attend. Legislators sometimes pay their own way or receive compensation if they speak.PG&E canceled its presence at the event as fires began raging in Northern California but did not seek a refund of its sponsorship, which the company said covered the entry fees for its officials. Executives of the two other investor-owned utilities, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, still attended.Also at the event were 10 members of the State Assembly and two state senators who sit on committees dealing with the state budget, appropriations, energy, public safety and insurance. The dozen lawmakers are among the biggest beneficiaries of campaign contributions from the three utilities, receiving more than $600,000 since 2011, according to Consumer Watchdog.Discussions at the conference covered many topics, including the wildfires, said Dylan Gray, chief of staff for Assemblyman Heath Flora, a Republican from the Central Valley who attended.Dan Howle, executive director and chairman of the Voter Project, said that no lobbying was permitted and that no specific legislation had been discussed.\u201cWhat would be wrong with elected officials and business discussing issues?\u201d he said. \u201cIf the public wants to go, the public can pay a fee.\u201dBut critics describe the event as part of a broader effort by businesses, particularly the utilities, to influence lawmakers. Consumer Watchdog, for example, found that PG&E and the other two utilities had contributed to the campaigns of between 80 percent and 90 percent of state legislators over the last two years.ImageSome of California\u2019s wildfires have been attributed to power lines falling into uncleared brush or other utility equipment like poles.CreditTerray Sylvester/ReutersLynsey Paulo, a PG&E spokeswoman, said the company used shareholder money for political activities like campaign contributions and lobbying, as well as tracking and analyzing bills before the Legislature. The company declined to discuss its role in the wildfires.Mr. Court called the recent political spending by the companies \u201cthe biggest lobbying orgy by the utilities\u201d since the last energy crisis in 2000 and 2001, when California gave its blessing to a rate increase.Now the spotlight is back on Sacramento and whether lawmakers will vote to protect utilities from the tab for the 2018 fires. PG&E\u2019s financial outlook, and perhaps its survival, depends on what happens.The company's stock lost more than 60 percent of its value after it disclosed that it had equipment failures near the origins of the Camp Fire, raising an additional $15 billion in exposure to damages, Citigroup has estimated. Southern California Edison made a similar filing regarding fires in its service area. Credit rating agencies downgraded the bonds of all three utilities, citing their fire liabilities.PG&E could also be prosecuted. The state attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said in a legal filing at the end of December that he could bring criminal charges against the company for its role in the fires if his office uncovered \u201creckless\u201d conduct by the utility. That filing was in an unrelated case.In a statement on Friday, PG&E said its board was reviewing the company\u2019s \u201cstructural options,\u201d searching for new directors and consulting experts about how the utility should prepare for future wildfires.Some lawmakers have said the state has no choice but to prevent another utility bankruptcy. They argue that while punishing the companies for fires that killed dozens of people and destroyed thousands of homes might seem justified, the state would end up hurting itself by signaling to bond investors and banks that they should avoid California\u2019s electricity business or lend to it only at much higher interest rates.Mr. Holden, the head of the Assembly\u2019s energy committee, has taken the lead in drafting the legislation. He is also among the recipients of the utilities\u2019 largess, with at least $71,750 in campaign contributions from the three companies since 2011. Mr. Holden declined to discuss the donations.But other lawmakers say they are done bailing out utilities. Critics of the companies would like to break up PG&E, potentially into separate gas and electric companies or by geographic areas. Protesters disrupted a meeting of the state\u2019s utility commission in November with chants and signs reading, \u201cNo PG&E bailout!\u201dState Senator Jerry Hill, a Democrat, said he was working on a bill that would break up PG&E. His district, south of San Francisco, includes San Bruno, the location of a 2010 PG&E pipeline explosion that killed eight people and destroyed dozens of homes. The state fined PG&E $1.6 billion for failing to maintain its lines and is investigating whether the company falsified pipeline reports.\u201cThe common thread seems to be negligence on the part of PG&E,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the investor-owned utility model that they have and use is not providing the priority of safety as it should. Their priority is to shareholders and maximizing profit and not safety.\u201d"}, {"title": "On Politics: The Biggest Stories of the Week", "category": "Politics", "id": "e6b858db-c753-4a38-9b50-d47cab65c957", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/us/politics/on-politics-the-biggest-stories-of-the-week.html", "publishdate": 20190105, "imageurl": "", "content": "From the government shutdown to the start of a new Congress, it\u2019s been a busy week in American politics.

Mr. Trump rejected the idea in a White House meeting on Wednesday, saying he would look \u201cfoolish\u201d if he compromised.After the Democrats took control of the House on Thursday, they passed two bills to reopen the government, knowing they would likely go nowhere in the Senate. The majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, said he would not bring up any legislation Mr. Trump did not support. Few Republicans called for an end to the shutdown.On Friday, the president threatened to keep agencies closed for \u201cmonths or even years.\u201d Mr. Trump also said he was considering declaring a national emergency to build a border wall without congressional approval.As the president holds firm on the shutdown, he hasn\u2019t publicly addressed the 800,000 federal workers going without pay. The administration said it would freeze pay raises for Vice President Mike Pence and other high-level officials.Additional Reading\u2022 Government Shutdown May Turn a Day in Court Into a Four-Year Wait\u2022 Shutdown Leaves Workers Reeling: \u2018We Seem to Be Pawns\u2019\u2022  As Shutdown Persists, New Congress Opens With Celebration and UncertaintyThe new Democratic majorityThe 116th Congress was called to order on Thursday, with ebullient Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives and electing Nancy Pelosi as speaker.Ms. Pelosi is the first lawmaker to win two separate terms as speaker in more than half a century, cementing her place as the highest-ranking and most powerful female elected official in the history of American politics. To win back the gavel, the California representative had to put down a rebellion in her caucus \u2014 and there are still dissenters in her ranks.Wasting no time, House Democrats on Friday unveiled details of ambitious legislation devised to lower barriers to the ballot box and require presidents and candidates for the nation\u2019s highest offices to release their tax returns.

But she is not sure it should happen in 2020.\u201cAre we ready in 2020? I really don\u2019t think we are,\u201d said Ms. Cusack, 75, a former Democratic National Committee member from Florida. Too many Americans may not want to \u201ctake another chance\u201d on a female candidate, Ms. Cusack said, after Hillary Clinton was met with mistrust and even hostility in swing states.But Andy McGuire, the former chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party, sees a different reality after a record number of Democratic women won races in the 2018 midterms. \u201cI\u2019d go back to this last election \u2014 who won?\u201d said Dr. McGuire, who, as a superdelegate like Ms. Cusack, supported Mrs. Clinton at the 2016 convention. \u201cWho had the excitement? Who had all the volunteers and power behind them? It was women.\u201dAs the 2020 primary competition gets underway with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s entry into the race, and with several other women likely to be early contenders, two competing narratives have emerged about the possibility of another woman leading the Democratic ticket, interviews with more than three dozen party officials, voters and pollsters showed.The year of the woman and the midterm gains that followed electrified Democrats, who have eagerly promoted themselves as the party of diversity. That success has inspired some of the most powerful women in politics to consider running for president. And it has boosted expectations that the political calculus for women has changed in the last two years, and that gender could become an asset, even in a presidential contest. Mrs. Clinton, after all, won the popular vote by almost three million.Yet at a time of ascendancy for women in the party, there\u2019s a lingering doubt in some quarters about whether there is a risk involved in nominating a woman to take on President Trump, whom Democrats fervently want to unseat.The specter of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat in 2016 still haunts some Democratic officials, voters and activists. There is widespread recognition that women in politics are held to a different standard than men on qualities like likability and toughness, and that voters have traditionally been more reluctant to elect women as executives than as legislators.Some women see bias in the excitement surrounding a potential presidential run by Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Texan who energized the left in a losing Senate bid, while Stacey Abrams is not mentioned as a possibility even though she had a much narrower loss for governor of Georgia.\u201cThere\u2019s a real tension,\u201d said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress and a former policy adviser to Mrs. Clinton. \u201cOn one hand, women are leading the resistance and deserve representation. But on the other side, there\u2019s a fear that if misogyny beat Clinton, it can beat other women.\u201dMuch of the debate is grounded in the question of whether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss represented a rejection of women as president, or of one specific woman. How significant a role sexism played in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s defeat is difficult to separate from the other liabilities that hindered her campaign. Mrs. Clinton struggled to deal with decades of political baggage and a Republican attack machine that cast her as aloof, elitist and disconnected. Her reliance on a tight-knit inner circle isolated her from tough political challenges, and she struggled to win over working-class white women and men.ImageElizabeth Warren speakng in Iowa Friday night. A field that includes multiple female candidates is expected to contend for the Democratic presidential nomination.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York TimesIf Democrats nominate a woman in 2020, she will most likely face an onslaught of gender-based attacks from Mr. Trump, who did not hesitate in 2016 to mock the physical appearance and stamina of his female opponents. As the Republican nominee, Mr. Trump carried more vulnerabilities on gender than any other modern candidate, facing allegations of sexual assault and harassment and having a record of lewd comments about women.Still, exit polls indicated that a majority of white women voted for Mr. Trump, helping him seal crucial Electoral College victories in traditionally Democratic states like Pennsylvania and Michigan.As Democrats look toward 2020, the conversation is particularly relevant because the 2020 primary season could prove to be as historic as the 2008 and 2016 races; in those years, Mrs. Clinton became the first woman to become a top-tier candidate and then a nominee.For the first time, multiple women may be serious contenders: Senator Warren is in, and Senators Kamala Harris of California, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are seriously considering running. A female front-runner would become a norm if a woman wins the nomination four years after Mrs. Clinton did.Women\u2019s political mobilization \u2014 as volunteers, candidates and donors \u2014 fueled the Democratic Party\u2019s gains in the November elections, and Democrats still far outpace Republicans in elevating women to party leadership and representation in Congress. Female politicians now head all four of the Democrats\u2019 campaign committees.Regardless of whether a woman wins the nomination, the presence of new, multiple female faces in the race could help the party move past a set of political expectations for women largely defined by Mrs. Clinton for decades. Already, comparisons to Mrs. Clinton have been unavoidable for the female 2020 contenders, even though they have little in common other than their gender and party.\u201cIt is very hard, when you only have that one woman who\u2019s tread that ground,\u201d said Ilyse Hogue, the president of the abortion-rights organization Naral. \u201cEverything about that individual becomes conflated with being a woman.\u201dThe rawness of the topic was evident in the furor that broke out this week over Ms. Warren\u2019s relatively low likability ratings. Research has found that it is much harder for female candidates to be rated as \u201clikable\u201d than men \u2014 and that they are disproportionately punished for traits voters accept in male politicians, including ambition and aggression. \u201cLikability is totally framed by gender,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a longtime Democratic pollster and expert on women\u2019s votes.Pushing back, Ms. Warren tweeted a video of herself on a train with the acid comment: \u201cI hear women candidates are most likable in the quiet car!\u201dYet for others, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss sounded some notes of caution.\u201cDuring the campaign, I was shocked over and over and over again to see the type of attacks toward very strong, knowledgeable women,\u201d said Isabel Farmer, a superdelegate from Ohio who received phone threats after backing Mrs. Clinton in 2016. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m still traumatized by that.\u2019\u2019Some voters acknowledged the higher standard applied to female candidates but said that was not a reason to abandon the pursuit of the White House.Image\u201cCould a woman win? Yes, and it\u2019s high time,\u201d said Patricia McAuley of Wyomissing, Pa.CreditHannah Yoon for The New York Times\u201cI think right now there\u2019s still not going to be a female president, unfortunately,\u201d said Jessica Nusbaum, of Wrightsville, Pa., as she walked through a mall in suburban Philadelphia. \u201cRight now I think we kind of \u2014 not regressed, but looked to the past.\u201d But she added, \u201cWomen should still run, even if they keep failing.\u201dPatricia McAuley, a Democrat from Wyomissing, Pa., agreed. \u201cI do believe they\u2019re held to a different standard,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cBut could a woman win? Yes, and it\u2019s high time.\u201dTo those still reeling from the 2016 loss, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate, had a blunt message: \u201cGet over it and use 2017 and 2018 as the evidence that the pathogen has left the body.\u201dRather than a liability, several Democrats believe that having women run could be a galvanizing force in the presidential race, as it was in the midterms, when female candidates changed the playbook for how women run for office. Many campaigned with their young children and made their personal stories central to their message. They were not afraid to challenge incumbents.Those campaigns, and the prospect of multiple female candidates, may change how women are treated in the presidential race.\u201cWhen you have two women running, the question becomes, what are you going to fight for, what do you believe in \u2014 not what are you going to do with your children, how do you get your hair to stay like that all day,\u201d said Representative Katie Porter, who defeated a female Republican incumbent to flip her California congressional seat in November.Ms. Lake, the Democratic pollster, pointed to women\u2019s high turnout rates in primaries, and to their success in championing issues like health care and education, which could continue to resonate in a presidential race. Those topics, along with immigration and income inequality, are likely to form the base of a national message for the nominee.And she noted that many of the states with early presidential primaries or caucuses have had women as governors or senators, suggesting that those voters had no reluctance about electing women. These include the former Democratic governor of New Hampshire; Democratic senators in New Hampshire, Nevada and California; the current Republican governor of Iowa; and the former governor of South Carolina.As Democrats prepare for a crowded primary field, there are other considerations that have nothing to do with gender, but rather the party\u2019s divisions over ideology and geography. Some are focusing on reversing Electoral College losses in the Midwest and argue a centrist from the region, male or female, might have broader appeal; others believe only progressives can fire up the party base. Senators Harris, Gillibrand and Warren are based on the coasts and have allied themselves with the party\u2019s left.However gender plays out in this election, many Democrats say it\u2019s impossible to imagine a future presidential field without women who are serious contenders \u2014 on both sides of the aisle.\u201cIt is more likely than not that you will have women running for president in both parties,\u201d said Kathy Sullivan, a longtime Democratic National Committee member and former state party chairwoman in New Hampshire. \u201cWomen will continue to run and at some point, hopefully before my untimely demise, a woman will be elected president.\u201d"}, {"title": "Elizabeth Warren Campaigns in Iowa: \u2018This Is How It Starts\u2019", "category": "Politics", "id": "31ba25dc-165b-45be-9058-6d7d1ecfe5ad", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-iowa.html", "publishdate": 20190105, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/05/us/05WARREN-iowa-sub/05WARREN-iowa-sub-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren hit the presidential campaign trail in southwestern Iowa on Friday evening, making her the first declared major candidate to host an event in the pivotal state and kicking off a Democratic primary season that promises to dominate the coming year.Hundreds of people packed a room in a bowling alley just across the state\u2019s border with Nebraska as Ms. Warren, the uncompromising leftist and ardent critic of unrestrained capitalism, tackled issues including income inequality and climate change in an hourlong question-and-answer session with voters.Though Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign is still nascent \u2014 she announced the formation of an exploratory presidential committee on Monday \u2014 Friday\u2019s event had all the hallmarks of a candidate meant to last: a laser-focused message on income inequality, a robust campaign staff shepherding hordes of interested reporters, and an excited supporter base eager to hear more.\u201cThis is how it starts. Person to person. Town to town. Across Iowa and then across America,\u201d Ms. Warren said, addressing supporters who were standing outside the venue, which was filled to capacity.\u201cAll of us, together, raising our voices \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make real change,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Iowa is going to have a big part of determining where we go next.\u201d[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]The event not only kicked off Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign, but marked the starting point to what figures to be a long and grueling Democratic primary season. Dozens of candidates, including governors, senators and big-city mayors \u2014 many of whom will be new to the national stage \u2014 are considering joining the race  in the coming months.Some have characterized the 2020 Democratic nomination process as perhaps the most wide open since 1992: The party has no single leader, no obvious front-runner to challenge President Trump in 2020, and no broadly unifying ideology as it moves away from a quarter-century of dominance by the Clintons and Barack Obama.Ms. Warren, who will be among the top-tier candidates no matter who else runs, has staked out a position as one of the party\u2019s most resolute voices on the left. Before she took questions from the audience, she laid out her overarching premise of America\u2019s ills: too much corporate money in the political system, a retrenchment from government regulation in the market and even overt discrimination that has affected racial minorities.\u201cIt is an America right now who works for the rich and powerful. And we need to call it out for what it is: corruption pure and simple,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening to opportunity in this country? Why is the path so rocky for many \u2014 and why is it so much rockier for people of color?\u201dMs. Warren also paid special attention to telling her personal story. To the assembled crowd about 500, which included almost 200 people waiting outside, she spoke of her Oklahoma roots and her family\u2019s humble upbringing.She said she was motivated to run for president, not by party politics or the desire to oppose President Trump, but because her personal life benefited from an American economy that has now become too inaccessible.The event comes in a busy week for Ms. Warren. After announcing her exploratory committee on Monday morning, she has four more events in Iowa this weekend, in Sioux City, Des Moines, Storm Lake and Ankeny. The Council Bluffs appearance on Friday drew Iowans and residents of nearby Omaha.In the crowd, many of the potential voters said they were just beginning to look at presidential candidates and had not yet decided on a singular person to support.Daniel Jaimes, a 28-year-old graduate student who supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary, said Ms. Warren was currently in his \u201ctop two\u201d choices, because she speaks to grass-roots populism.Gary Himes, 70, said he voted for Mr. Trump in the 2016 election but had been so disappointed by the current administration that he intends to vote for a Democrat \u201cno matter what.\u201d Liel Wilwerding, a 36-year-old Omaha resident, said she was looking for a candidate who can win back former Trump voters, like Mr. Himes.\u201cIt\u2019s important to pick a candidate who can go into these areas and be attractive,\u201d said Ms. Wilwerding, who also supported Ms. Sanders in the 2016 primary.Ms. Wilwerding brought a gift for Ms. Warren: a cross-stitched pattern that read \u201cNevertheless, she persisted,\u201d the admonishment-turned-rallying cry spoken by Mitch McConnell, the majority leader and Republican of Kentucky, when he cut short a speech by Ms. Warren on the Senate floor last year.But most of all, many of the voters said they were excited to spend the next year hearing from several candidates.\u201cI supported Bernie in the primary, but I\u2019m keeping my options open,\u201d said Sarah Jane Teetzel, a 46-year-old Omaha resident.

She\u2019s a relatively tech-savvy retiree and a longtime Apple fan who has used many of the company\u2019s products over the years. I learned to type on an Apple IIGS at her office, and she was an early adopter of the original turquoise iMac. These days, she uses her iPhone to check Facebook and Instagram, talk with her friends and relatives, and play solitaire and Words With Friends.Her phone isn\u2019t the latest model \u2014 it\u2019s a three-year-old iPhone 6S \u2014 and it\u2019s missing some of the latest features. She can\u2019t take portrait mode photos using a dual-lens camera, a feature introduced in the iPhone 7 Plus, and she can\u2019t unlock her phone using Face ID, which was introduced in the iPhone X in 2017. Her phone\u2019s battery life could be better, and the device sometimes runs out of storage space.But she\u2019s happy with it, and doesn\u2019t feel the need to upgrade. She also has a first-generation Apple Watch and a several-versions-ago MacBook Air, neither of which she\u2019s planning to replace anytime soon.\u201cThe phone I have does just about everything I need,\u201d she said when I called her to ask why she hadn\u2019t upgraded to one of the newer models. \u201cWhy pay $800 for a new one just to be up to date? My needs aren\u2019t that complicated.\u201dMost of the journalists who write about tech for a living (including me) are early adopters \u2014 power users who like having the latest gadgets, and who are willing to fork over money for a slightly better experience. For some of these people, Apple\u2019s announcement has come as a shock that portends potential disaster for the company.But for my mom, and the many people who are probably in her situation, the company\u2019s slowing iPhone sales aren\u2019t at all a disaster. In fact, they make total sense, and they don\u2019t have much to do with China.In a letter to investors explaining the lower forecast, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, nodded to smaller-than-expected demand for iPhone upgrades, saying that consumers were \u201cadapting to a world with fewer carrier subsidies\u201d and \u201ctaking advantage of significantly reduced pricing for iPhone battery replacements.\u201d The company declined to comment for this column.Apple is also facing competition from rivals like Samsung and Huawei, which have flooded international markets with lower-cost Androids that are, in many cases, just as functional as iPhones. And, yes, there are issues related to President Trump\u2019s trade war with China, and an overall economic slowdown in the country.But the most consequential hit to Apple\u2019s bottom line may be from people who are holding on to their phones for longer. Back in 2015, iPhones were being replaced after roughly two years, on average, according to BayStreet Research, a firm that tracks smartphone sales. That period has jumped to roughly three years, and is expected to grow even more.ImageAn Apple store in Beijing.

The components inside newer phones, such as added memory and improved screen technology, are more expensive than older components. Refurbished and used phones are also more easily available, and carriers like Verizon and AT&T aren\u2019t subsidizing new phone purchases as heavily as they once did, meaning that the up-front cost to the customer is higher.\u201cIt used to be that for $650, you got all new features, a better screen, everything,\u201d Mr. Caso said. \u201cNow, to put more features in the phone, it costs money.\u201dThere are Apple-specific variables, too. The newest version of Apple\u2019s mobile operating systems, iOS 12, was designed to improve the performance of older devices. (This was a refreshing change from previous iOS updates, which tended to grind older models to a halt.) With better water resistance and sturdier screens, iPhones are more physically resilient than they used to be. And the list of must-have new features has shrunk. With a few exceptions \u2014 like Face ID and animated emojis \u2014 there is nothing you can do on a new iPhone that you can\u2019t do on one from several years ago.Apple has also taken a hit from its battery replacement program, which offered steep discounts to many customers after the company was accused of slowing down older iPhones. That led some users to replace their batteries rather than their entire iPhone.All of this is worrying short-term investors, who want people to buy as many new iPhones as possible. But it\u2019s great for people like my mom, who get to keep phones they\u2019re happy with and replace them less frequently. It\u2019s great for the environment \u2014 according to Apple\u2019s latest sustainability report, each new Apple device produced generates an average of 90 kilograms of carbon emissions.A more durable iPhone could even be great for Apple\u2019s long-term profitability. As Brian Barrett points out at Wired, \u201cAn iPhone that lasts longer keeps customers in the iOS ecosystem longer,\u201d and more willing to keep their paid subscriptions to Apple Music, iCloud and other Apple services.Apple\u2019s longer replacement cycle may be a temporary phenomenon, if newer technologies \u2014 such as compatibility with 5G mobile networks, which is expected to arrive in iPhones in 2020 \u2014 lead to popular apps that don\u2019t run on older phones.\u201cIf there\u2019s an app \u2014 maybe it\u2019s Fortnite 2 \u2014 that I can\u2019t run on my existing iPhone, a new iPhone will be on every teenage boy\u2019s shopping list,\u201d Mr. Caso said.But for now, while investors might be unhappy with the company\u2019s short-term sales, the rest of us should cheer it as a sign of progress in giving customers what they want: sturdy, reliable phones that don\u2019t become obsolete as soon as a new model arrives.When I asked my mom what would get her to upgrade to a newer iPhone, she said she might do it if a new, killer feature came along, or if her favorite apps no longer worked. But in the end, she admitted that wasn\u2019t likely.\u201cUntil I drop it and break it, I\u2019ll probably keep it,\u201d she said."}, {"title": "Sony\u2019s Chief Plans to Make Entertainment Assets a Priority", "category": "Business", "id": "a34c38e7-707f-4e24-bb4d-e2455572cd4d", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/06/business/media/sony-movies-television-ces-playstation.html", "publishdate": 20190106, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/07/business/07sony/merlin_138504777_afe08fb5-b269-44db-bcd4-f4de78656ef0-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 What will happen to Sony Pictures?That has been a question in Hollywood since Kenichiro Yoshida took over as Sony Corporation\u2019s chief executive in April. Unlike his two predecessors, Mr. Yoshida, a number-cruncher based in Japan and known for jettisoning underperforming businesses, seemed to have little affinity for the company\u2019s also-ran movie and television division, which is best known as the home of Spider-Man and \u201cSeinfeld.\u201dSurely this would be the moment for Sony to get rid of the midsize studio \u2014 especially since Rupert Murdoch had just decided to sell his bigger 20th Century Fox to Disney, having concluded it did not have the scale needed to compete with moviedom insurgents like Netflix, Apple and Amazon.Surprise. When Mr. Yoshida takes the stage on Monday at the CES trade show in Las Vegas, he plans to use the high-profile platform to showcase Sony movies, television shows and music. He plans to telegraph that not only will his Sony not exit any of these businesses, it will make them a priority as his predecessors have not. In particular, Mr. Yoshida wants to make better use of the company\u2019s online PlayStation Network as a way to bring Sony movies, shows and music directly to consumers. PlayStation Network, introduced in 2006, now has more than 80 million monthly active users.\u201cI want to convey the message that Sony is a creative entertainment company,\u201d Mr. Yoshida said by phone from Tokyo before leaving for Nevada. That description amounts to a significant shift. Sony has long been seen as a consumer electronics superpower first and a Hollywood entity second.He added that Sony\u2019s three separately run entertainment businesses \u2014 music, gaming and motion pictures \u2014 have been told from on high that it is time to collaborate more consistently. In the past, analysts say, PlayStation Network managers have been hesitant to team up with their movie and music counterparts, worrying that the service\u2019s core gamers would balk if they felt that Sony was pushing, say, family films at them.Mr. Yoshida seemed less concerned. He called PlayStation Network \u201ca very strong entertainment platform for all of Sony \u2014 very suitable for video and music content.\u201dMr. Yoshida said he was asking for collaboration at a time when all the pertinent divisions have new leaders. Tony Vinciquerra became chief executive of Sony Pictures in June 2017. John Kodera took over gaming slightly more than a year ago. In recent months, Rob Stringer and Jon Platt were named as Sony\u2019s top executives in music recording and publishing. All report to Mr. Yoshida; he said he had no plans to consolidate the entertainment businesses under a single executive.\u201cEntertainment is in Sony\u2019s DNA,\u201d Mr. Yoshida said. \u201cWe\u2019ve now been in the music business for 50 years, the motion picture business for 30 years and the game business for over 25 years.\u201d For its last fiscal year, the three units made up 47 percent of Sony\u2019s operating profit, which totaled $6.7 billion, the highest in the conglomerate\u2019s 72-year history.Positioning Sony as an entertainment company represents a \u201cdirectional change\u201d and fits with other public comments Mr. Yoshida has made since he took over nine months ago, said Masaru Sugiyama, a Goldman Sachs analyst. \u201cIt has felt as if entertainment is more integrated with the rest of Sony within Yoshida-san\u2019s mind,\u201d Mr. Sugiyama said.Even so, Sony is in no way leaning away from its portfolio of technology and consumer products.At CES, as the Las Vegas trade show is known, Sony is expected to showcase image sensors for cars, new audio products, ultra-ultra high-definition televisions and robotics. Thomas E. Rothman, Sony\u2019s movie chief, will take the stage after Mr. Yoshida to talk up the company\u2019s turnaround in film, bringing along Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, producers of the studio\u2019s recent \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\u201d But Mr. Rothman\u2019s remarks will be peppered with references to how Sony cameras have helped the studio \u2014 its tech breakthroughs bolstering its creative endeavors.Sony\u2019s entertainment empire has its share of challenges, of course.After buying out partners, Sony has outright control of the world\u2019s largest catalog of music publishing assets. But the recording unit had a soft 2018 in the hit department.Apple has been poaching Sony television and film executives to work on its coming streaming service. And major Sony-made television shows like \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d and \u201cThe Blacklist\u201d are aging. Efforts to find replacements have mostly fizzled, in part because the highest-paying TV networks are ordering more shows from in-house suppliers.As a whole, however, Sony\u2019s entertainment businesses are stronger than they have been in memory \u2014 in particular the film division, which suffered a devastating cyberattack in 2014. Mr. Rothman and Mr. Vinciquerra have turned movies into an unexpected engine by cutting costs and focusing more intently on all-audience \u201ctent pole\u201d fantasies like \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,\u201d which took in $962 million worldwide in 2017. To dropped jaws in Hollywood, \u201cVenom\u201d generated $856 million in ticket sales late last year.Sony has a parade of big-budget sequels on the way \u2014 \u201cMen in Black: International\u201d arrives in June \u2014 and the studio is aggressively mining the rights it holds to Marvel characters in the Spider-Man comics family. To that end, movies based on Morbius, Black Cat and Silver Sable are in the works; the Sinister Six could be Sony\u2019s answer to \u201cThe Avengers.\u201d Sony is also considering making animated television shows based on characters introduced in \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d which has collected $276 million at the box office.Now that Fox has been sold, only Disney and Sony have rights to make Marvel-related film and television content.And Marvel characters are popular with the PlayStation Network crowd. One reason that Mr. Yoshida is pushing for more collaboration: Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man, a $60 game, set a record for Sony in September by selling 3.3 million copies in its first three days of release."}, {"title": "Who Wants a Market Downturn?

How? Mr. Minhaj dared to question Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, both for the C.I.A.\u2019s conclusion he ordered the murder of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and for Saudi war atrocities in Yemen.Maybe the Saudi complaint wasn\u2019t all that shocking. Like any authoritarian monarch worth his bone saw, Prince Mohammed doesn\u2019t brook criticism, which is why he has overseen the Saudis\u2019 increased jailing of journalists, critics and rivals.The shock came with Netflix\u2019s supine compliance. After pulling the episode from its Saudi feed, the streaming service told The Financial Times it was simply responding to \u201ca valid legal request.\u201dAdd another 10 paces to America\u2019s retreat from its place at the forefront of free speech and political expression.It was but one episode in one country.

Iger, and Mr. Murdoch feted him last spring at intimate dinners around Los Angeles, despite news of repression in the kingdom and civilian deaths in Yemen.Then came the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, who wrote columns for The Washington Post that were critical of the crown prince. According to United States intelligence, Prince Mohammed had ordered Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, which his men carried out with slasher-flick aplomb, reportedly using a bone saw to dismember his body.That wasn\u2019t enough for President Trump, who sowed doubt about the intelligence conclusion while praising Saudi Arabia for \u201ckeeping oil prices at reasonable levels.\u201d The message on human rights and the First Amendment: Make me an offer.Mr. Trump didn\u2019t invent realpolitik. But previously, even when American actions contradicted its vision of itself, presidential paeans to democratic norms carried at least symbolic weight.Netflix had an opportunity to send a different message.\u201cEven more because Trump and the White House have been so much putting money over lives, frankly, I\u2019d hoped that this was where American businesses could take a stand,\u201d said The Post\u2019s global opinions editor Karen Attiah, who edited Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s columns. \u201cNetflix really had a chance to stand up for values and for Hasan.\u201dAt the very least, she said, Netflix should have never called the Saudis\u2019 legal request \u201cvalid,\u201d even if it believed it had to comply to maintain its presence in the country.Netflix wouldn\u2019t answer my question about what made the request \u201cvalid.\u201d In a statement to me, its general counsel, David Hyman, said, \u201cOur programs push the boundaries on important social and other issues in many places around the world.\u201d But, he added, \u201cto run a global service\u201d the company has to abide by foreign laws \u201ceven when we disagree with them.\u201d That is, a Netflix that compromises with rogue-ish regimes is better for free expression than no Netflix at all.One person outside the production, who was briefed on the deliberations in real time, told me Netflix discussed potential problems the episode would cause in Saudi Arabia before Mr. Minhaj filmed it, and raised the idea of scuttling it. This person would only speak on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the private discussions. An executive at the company, speaking on condition of anonymity for the same reason, said it only shared potential legal consequences with Mr. Minhaj\u2019s team as due diligence, noting it ultimately went forward with the show and its distribution in Saudi Arabia.Until it didn\u2019t.There have been other times when American businesses put American values above their bottom lines. After Steven Van Zandt, the E Street Band guitarist, led a musicians\u2019 boycott of South Africa to protest apartheid, corporations including Coca-Cola, General Electric and GTE followed suit by withdrawing from the country.It\u2019s true that the entertainment industry did not bathe itself in glory during Hitler\u2019s early years.But throughout the war and afterward, they, along with many other major American corporations, joined the robust national effort to defeat the Nazis and promote American values throughout Europe, which helped the United States win the Cold War.It\u2019s a little hard to imagine such a national effort coming together now.Maybe that\u2019s partly because the major social media and entertainment platforms have such global scale that they\u2019re almost their own borderless governments.\u201cIt seems to be a moment in the evolution of the corporation that it starts to become akin to a world actor in its own right,\u201d Nicholas J. Cull, a professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism who has written extensively on the American information effort during the Cold War. When it comes to their home country, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018We\u2019re sympathetic, but we have our own set of interests.\u2019\u201dThe media behemoths would be wise to remember that their future growth will rely on having the same liberties that fostered their creation.I\u2019m reminded of a line from the Netflix-BBC One co-production of \u201cWatership Down,\u201d based on Richard Adams\u2019s allegorical novel about a noble herd of rabbits\u2019 pursuit of a peaceful homeland. After their leader Hazel helps another group of rabbits escape a totalitarian warren, he tells them, \u201cYou have fought so hard to earn your freedom, but now you must fight to keep it, because the battle for liberty is one which has no end.\u201dTake heed, Netflix."}, {"title": "As Big Retailers Seek to Cut Their Tax Bills, Towns Bear the Brunt", "category": "Business", "id": "76b26c2e-eb43-4615-a3b1-04486f8b80d0", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/06/business/economy/retailers-property-tax-dark-stores.html", "publishdate": 20190106, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/06/business/06dark-1-print/merlin_148445169_1f1a2d2d-cba4-48df-b4e1-daa0da7fdaf1-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "WAUWATOSA, Wis. \u2014 With astonishing range and rapidity, big-box retailers and corporate giants are using an aggressive legal tactic to shrink their property tax bills, a strategy that is costing local governments and school districts around the country hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue.These businesses \u2014 many of them brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, Home Depot, Target, Kohl\u2019s, Menards and Walgreens that have faced fierce online competition \u2014 maintain that no matter how valuable a thriving store is to its current owner, these warehouse-type structures are not worth much to anyone else.So the best way to appraise their property, they contend in their tax appeals, is to look at the sale prices on the open market of vacant or formerly vacant shells in other places. As shuttered stores spread across the landscape, their argument has resonated.To municipalities, these appeals amount to a far-fetched tax dodge that allows corporations to wriggle out of paying their fair share.Either way, homeowners and small businesses will have to pay more or live with smaller budgets for police, schools, garbage pickup and road repair.Businesses, of course, appeal property assessments as routinely as coaches work the refs. But this approach \u2014 labeled dark store theory by critics \u2014 significantly broadens the basis for those appeals while threatening to undermine municipalities\u2019 ability to raise operating funds.\u201cThe potential for a domino effect of property tax appeals across the commercial and industrial portions of the tax base, which, were it to occur, could have a much more profound effect on some governments\u2019 ability to levy\u201d property taxes,\u201d S&P Global Ratings concluded in a report last year.For a smaller town or school district, \u201cthe financial impact could be devastating,\u201d said Scott Nees, a co-author of the report, noting that it could also threaten localities\u2019 ability to borrow money.In Michigan, the state association of counties estimated that dark-store appeals reduced local revenue from 2013 to 2017 by $100 million. In Texas, the comptroller said such appeals could end up costing local governments $2.6 billion a year.ImageMayor Kathleen Ehley of Wauwatosa said use of \u201cdark store theory\u201d had expanded \u201clike a virus.\u201dCreditTaylor Glascock for The New York TimesAnd in Wauwatosa, a shopping polestar in Wisconsin where chockablock malls attract families in the market for $4,000 sofas, Adidas NMDs and a Cheesecake Factory pig out, the city is fighting property tax appeals in court dating back to 2015 from Lowe\u2019s, Nordstrom, Best Buy, Meijer and United Healthcare. It recently settled with Target, Walgreens and a KFC franchise.\u201cIt\u2019s like a virus,\u201d said Kathleen Ehley, the mayor of Wauwatosa.In the Lowe\u2019s case, the company spent more than $16 million to buy the land and construct its 140,000-square-foot building less than a dozen years ago. The city assessed the spot in a bustling retail hub right off Highway 41 at $13.6 million. The company\u2019s appraisal was $7.1 million, based on sales of empty and once empty buildings in other neighborhoods.Lowe\u2019s declined to comment because the case is being litigated.But the city\u2019s assessor said Lowe\u2019s had partly based its analysis on stores that were more than 25 years old and in economically declining neighborhoods. Another store was listed as comparable in part because of its \u201cproximity\u201d to a shopping mall, although instead of the booming center near this Lowe\u2019s, that mall had closed 15 years earlier.City officials estimate that the current string of dark-store lawsuits alone would require it to refund $4.1 million of tax payments \u2014 the equivalent of about a tenth of its total property tax revenue this year.\u201cEither my property taxes are going to go up or my schools are going to suffer,\u201d said Lisa Williams, who lives in a classic Craftsman-style bungalow a few minutes\u2019 drive from Lowe\u2019s in Wauwatosa, a comfortable suburb of Milwaukee. \u201cThe stores want to get all the benefits of being here without any of the costs.\u201dMs. Williams, 53, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who has three children, added, \u201cEverybody in the neighborhood shops there.\u201dEfforts to reduce tax assessments on the local level are continuing even as businesses are seeing hefty reductions in their federal taxes from last year\u2019s tax overhaul in Washington.The dark-store argument started to gain traction in a few states in the mid-2000s, but has snowballed in the last year. After retailers won some influential legal decisions, thousands of similar appeals from other commercial taxpayers \u2014 from manufacturers to owners of corporate office buildings \u2014 have followed.The judicial victories have elbowed the issue into the political arena. Several states, like Alabama, Texas and Indiana, have considered legislation that would curb the tactic.ImageLisa Williams, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said everybody in her Wauwatosa neighborhood shopped at Lowe\u2019s and other big-box stores.CreditTaylor Glascock for The New York TimesImageOfficials in Wauwatosa said the crop of dark-store lawsuits would require the city to refund $4.1 million in tax payments.CreditTaylor Glascock for The New York TimesIn nonbinding referendums in November, voters in 23 counties and cities across Wisconsin approved proposals calling for laws to prevent dark-store analyses from being used in tax assessments. (Wauwatosa was not among them.)That and similar legislative proposals have been opposed by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state\u2019s largest business association.\u201cLocal governments want to exclude vacant buildings because a lot of retail has gone vacant in recent years,\u201d said Scott Manley, the group\u2019s vice president of governmental relations. \u201cRetail property is less valuable today, and they don\u2019t want to acknowledge it.\u201dAppraisal guidelines vary from state to state. But mega-retailers argue, in essence, that traditional approaches that look at land and building costs or how much income the property can generate are not relevant. Instead, they say, appraisals should primarily rely on comparable sales, and the only sales that are comparable are of other big-box stores that have been vacated.Empty commercial buildings often go for bargain-basement prices because the structures \u2014 football-field-size stores or factories \u2014 were developed for specific purposes and, therefore, attract few, if any, buyers.\u201cThese warehouses are obsolete pretty much from the moment they build them,\u201d said Robert Hill, a lawyer in Minnesota who has represented Walmart, Menards, Walgreens, CVS, Sturm Foods, United Healthcare and other companies. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether they\u2019re for sale in a suburb of Virginia or Nome, Alaska.\u201dImageMeijer is one of numerous big-box stores in Wauwatosa challenging its assessment using the dark-store theory.CreditTaylor Glascock for The New York TimesThis is not an entirely new idea. In 1921, the New York Stock Exchange appealed its property tax assessment, arguing that because its building could not be adapted for any other use, it should be considered only a \u201ctear-down proposition\u201d that decreased the value of the land. A State Supreme Court judge disagreed.Sales comparisons often make sense for homes, experts say, because they can estimate what a willing buyer would pay by looking at recent sales of similar houses or apartments on the same block or in the neighborhood.Appraisals can be much more complicated when it comes to a specialized commercial property, where adjustments have to be made for location, condition, size, the incomes of area residents, traffic flow and much more. Is the property on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan or in a dead suburban mall? Is the building three years old or 30? Restrictive clauses in leases that companies themselves impose \u2014 such as prohibiting its use by a competitor \u2014 can further depress a property\u2019s value.Sales comparisons are reliable benchmarks but only when there are lots of substitute properties and data, the International Association of Assessing Officers concluded in a 2017 report. \u201cUsing vacant sale comparables (without adjustment) to value an occupied property is not proper appraisal practice,\u201d it said.What constitutes a fair comparison and adjustment, however, is open to debate.\u201cCourts are grappling with the meaning of market value,\u201d said Joan Youngman, chairwoman of the Department of Valuation and Taxation at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy in Cambridge, Mass. \u201cWe are in the early stages of the issue working its way through the higher courts, and we don\u2019t have the answers to some of these questions.\u201dImageManawa, Wis., had to raise property taxes by 12.4 percent \u2014 $300 per homeowner on average \u2014 after settling a yearslong tax dispute with Sturm Foods.CreditTaylor Glascock for The New York TimesImageThe property tax appeal by Sturm Foods, which is the largest local employer in Manawa, began a couple of years after TreeHouse Foods bought Sturm for $660 million in 2009.CreditTaylor Glascock for The New York TimesIn Manawa, a town about 130 miles north of Milwaukee that has a population of 1,294, the mayor is carefully monitoring snow plowers\u2019 overtime after settling a yearslong tax dispute with Sturm Foods, the largest local employer.

Not EBW Electronics. As the decades passed, the family-owned business stayed put on the eastern edge of Lake Michigan, churning out lights for the auto industry.But now, the company\u2019s management is reluctantly mulling the possibility of moving its production to Mexico to escape the tariffs that President Trump has put on imported components, his primary weapons in a trade war waged in the name of bringing jobs home to America.\u201cIt\u2019s killing us,\u201d said the chairman of the company, Pat LeBlanc, 63, a Republican who voted for Mr. Trump. He now expects the president\u2019s tariffs will chop his 2019 profits in half. \u201cI just feel so betrayed. If we fail because the company is being harmed by the government, that just makes me sick.\u201dAcross the industrial United States, including in the crucial political battleground state of Michigan, such complaints are intensifying as the trade war disrupts factory operations that depend on imported parts.The tariffs have also begun to hurt China, contributing to anxieties about a slowdown in the world\u2019s second largest economy. Those worries have filtered back to the United States, amplifying concerns about the global economy, sending stock markets plunging, and putting pressure on American companies, like Apple, that sell goods in China.Investors took comfort on Friday from a surprisingly strong report on the American job market, which underscored the health of the broader economy. But weakening factory orders in the United States, China and Europe have deepened the sense that global growth is slowing.ImageEBW Electronics, a family-owned business on Lake Michigan, makes lights for the auto industry. It has stayed put while others have moved, but now its management is considering moving production to Mexico.CreditWhitten Sabbatini for The New York TimesAs American and Chinese trade negotiators sit down in Beijing on Monday for talks aimed at settling hostilities, they confront pressure from both sides to achieve a truce.In the United States, factories that buy steel and aluminum \u2014 now more expensive \u2014 are struggling to pass on extra costs to their customers. Some are losing orders to overseas competitors that can buy metal free of American tariffs. Companies that import electronics and other parts are scrambling to remain profitable while exploring alternatives, such as moving plants beyond reach of the duties.\u201cIt\u2019s a tax that comes right off the bottom line,\u201d said EBW\u2019s president, Cory Steeby. \u201cIt totally incentivizes you to move out of the United States and build either in Canada or Mexico. These are active conversations right now.\u201dMr. Trump portrays his trade war as an unavoidable confrontation aimed at remedying decades of American victimization in the global marketplace. Pointing at trade deficits as indications that Americans have been ripped off \u2014 a contention dismissed by many economists \u2014 he has unleashed 25 percent tariffs on imports of steel and 10 percent on aluminum.He has trained special wrath on China, imposing tariffs reaching 25 percent on some $50 billion worth of Chinese imported goods, and 10 percent on an additional $200 billion worth of products. Barring a deal in the next two months or an extension of a fragile cease-fire, Mr. Trump has vowed to increase duties to 25 percent on the whole lot, while threatening to target an additional $267 billion in Chinese imports.The tariffs have been sold to Americans as a means of forcing multinational companies to make their products in the United States, abandoning China, Mexico and other low-cost centers of industry. But the tariffs are threatening jobs that are already here.Trade in components has grown in recent years, as American industrial prowess has become increasingly dependent on access to the global supply chain. Back in 2009, American factories imported some 20 percent of the electronic products and computers they folded into their operations, according to an analysis by the United States International Trade Commission. By 2016, the share had risen to 25 percent.ImageEBW\u2019s president, Cory Steeby, left, and chairman, Pat LeBlanc. \u201cIt\u2019s killing us,\u201d Mr. LeBlanc said of the tariffs. He said he was expecting his 2019 profits to be cut in half.CreditWhitten Sabbatini for The New York TimesHere in western Michigan, Mr. Trump\u2019s promises to confront China have found a sympathetic audience. The lakefront town of Holland, home to 33,000 people, has long prospered as a center for the production of office furniture and auto parts \u2014 industries assailed by cheaper imports from China.In vowing to take a tough line with China, Mr. Trump secured 62 percent of the votes in surrounding Ottawa County. Though the tariffs he has imposed have lifted prices for parts at many factories, the president draws praise here for delivering on a central promise.\u201cEven though it\u2019s hurting me, I hope we have the guts to stick it out,\u201d said Tom Sligh, president of Billco Products, which makes cabinets, dressers and other furniture for hotels at three factories in Holland.Mr. Sligh grew up working at the furniture business his great-grandfather started more than a century ago. The company shuttered in 2005, a casualty of imports from China.In his own business, Mr. Sligh relies on imported quartz countertops and metal parts \u2014 door handles, gliders and other hardware \u2014 much of it made in China.The tariffs have increased his costs by 10 percent, he said, but he has not been able to pass them on. He recently lost a bid to outfit a hotel in Grand Rapids when a Chinese competitor offered less than half his price.He slashed Christmas bonuses for his factory workers. He has decreased purchases from Chinese factories to avoid tariffs, though this has not translated into extra orders for American companies. He has shifted to suppliers in Vietnam, Malaysia and India. The parts he needs are not available in the United States, or are wildly expensive, he said.Even so, he sees the trade war as beneficial.\u201cIt sends a message to our friends in China that we are not fooling around,\u201d Mr. Sligh said.But many of those running factories here complain that they are being harmed.Larry Kooiker voted for Mr. Trump, and shares the sense that China\u2019s trading actions require an aggressive response. But Mr. Kooiker, president of Agritek, a factory that makes a range of metal parts, says the tariffs on components have been poorly conceived.\u201cIt\u2019s just been a disaster,\u201d he said, as clattering machinery pounded sheets of steel into brackets that hold shelves.The steel tariffs were supposed to give American steel makers protection in the face of unfair competition from China. But Mr. Kooiker accuses American steel makers of profiteering at his expense, using the tariffs as an opportunity to raise prices by 25 percent.\u201cThey are very much taking advantage of the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cAs soon as they are not squeezed, they become the squeezer.\u201dAgritek has passed on the extra costs for steel to customers through surcharges. But it recently lost an order worth $1 million a year making steel axles used in wheeled trash bins \u2014 a major hit for a company with some $16 million in annual sales.According to Mr. Kooiker, the customer found a supplier in China that could produce the axles more cheaply. Agritek managed to avoid layoffs by transferring the two workers who made the axles to another job, but someone else might have been hired for that work. The American steel companies he buys from lost out. The only beneficiary is the Chinese company now supplying the entire product.Image\u201cEven though it\u2019s hurting me, I hope we have the guts to stick it out,\u201d said Tom Sligh, president of Billco Products.CreditWhitten Sabbatini for The New York Times\u201cTrump is killing us,\u201d Mr. Kooiker said. \u201cHis bang for the buck is horrible.\u201dFor EBW Electronics, the biggest hit has come through increased costs for components, including transistors, resistors and capacitors. Across the breadth of the factory, workers in blue lab coats slot these nibs of metal into circuit boards and then attach LED lights, most of these items imported from China.These components are produced at enormous scale in China. Even with tariffs on Chinese imports, American factories have no incentive to make them, because profit margins are tiny, and the costs are vast.\u201cNobody in this country wants to make these things,\u201d said Mr. Steeby, the EBW president, echoing a contention heard widely here.The company has filed for exemptions from the tariffs, but has yet to hear back from the federal government. And EBW has encountered stiff resistance in passing on the extra costs to its customers, though it is obliged to continue delivering lights to major auto manufacturers at agreed-upon prices, or pay fines for interfering with production.\u201cWe\u2019re the monkey in the middle,\u201d said Mr. LeBlanc, the EBW chairman.If Mr. Trump follows through on threats to raise tariffs to 25 percent, EBW and its 230 employees could face dire circumstances.\u201cAt 25 percent, we are not making money,\u201d Mr. Steeby said. \u201cThere\u2019s a threat that you cease to exist, or there\u2019s a threat that jobs move to Mexico.\u201dIn an era of anxiety over global competition, EBW has engaged Chinese suppliers to produce a crucial commodity \u2014 American paychecks. Now, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs have put jobs at risk.\u201cThere\u2019s no intelligence to the way this is being done,\u201d Mr. Steeby said. \u201cThe tariffs are designed to hurt China, but they are being paid by American companies.\u201d"}, {"title": "Biden in 2020?

Biden Jr. is in the final stages of deciding whether to run for president and has told allies he is skeptical the other Democrats eyeing the White House can defeat President Trump, an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the veteran Washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced contenders for the party\u2019s 2020 nomination.Many Democratic voters, and nearly all major Democratic donors, are keenly interested in Mr. Biden\u2019s plans because of their consuming focus on finding a candidate who can beat a president they believe represents a threat to American democracy. But there is also a rising demand in the party for a more progressive standard-bearer who reflects the increasingly diverse Democratic coalition.Mr. Biden would instantly be the early front-runner if he ran, but he would have to bridge divides in a primary that would test whether Democrats are willing to embrace a moderate white man in his 70s if they view him as the best bet to oust Mr. Trump.\u201cHe has the best chance of beating Trump, hands down,\u201d said Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, Mr. Biden\u2019s longtime friend and former colleague. \u201cOn a scale of one to 10, that\u2019s probably about a 12 for us.\u201dYet Mr. Biden\u2019s skepticism about the field could alienate female and minority voters who are excited that several women and African-Americans are expected to run. Nominating a white man may also roil some Democrats who are already torn about whether a woman could win in 2020 after Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss. And Mr. Biden\u2019s preoccupation with winning back blue-collar Midwestern whites could place him at odds with Democrats who see greater potential for growth in the highly educated suburbs and across the booming Sun Belt and upper South.More broadly, debate around Mr. Biden\u2019s possible candidacy illustrates the dueling visions in the party and particularly the divisions between its pragmatic and liberal wing. Some Democrats are skeptical that a relatively moderate candidate like Mr. Biden, who has baggage like supporting the 1990s crime bill that is loathed on the left, would prevail in the primary with a message of unity and national healing rather than the fiery and uncompromising brand of populism that Democratic primary voters elevated in the midterm elections.\u201cIn 2020, Biden-style centrism will become a toxic and losing brand of politics in Democratic primaries,\u201d said Waleed Shahid, a left-wing activist.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]The 76-year-old former vice president, who leads the field in initial national and Iowa polls, has not yet told his allies that he has decided to run. And they emphasize that Mr. Biden\u2019s decision will not be final until he says it for himself, noting that family considerations are central. Mr. Biden sought the presidency twice before but he has also considered it at least as many times before bowing out.But Mr. Biden has indicated that he is leaning toward running and will most likely make a decision within the next two weeks, according to Democrats within and beyond his inner circle who have spoken to him recently.The former vice president told a senior Democratic official last week that he is both likely to run and that his aides have told him he must move quickly in this primary, according to two Democrats briefed on the conversation.Mr. Biden is under significant pressure from his party\u2019s major donors to make up his mind \u2014 no later than the end of January \u2014 or risk watching them migrate to other candidates. Mr. Biden and his advisers are highly sensitive to the criticism that in 2015, he dragged out his decision before ultimately opting out of the Democratic primary, exasperating his supporters and undermining the Democratic front-runner, Mrs. Clinton, in the process.ImageSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts entered the Democratic primary race last week, and several other women are considering a 2020 run as well.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York TimesHe spent some of his Christmas vacation in the Virgin Islands calling and texting his would-be supporters and is using this week to hold private meetings in Washington with Democratic officials.In one of his calls over the holidays, Mr. Biden repeated a variation of a line he has used publicly: \u201cIf you can persuade me there is somebody better who can win, I\u2019m happy not to do it,\u201d he said, according to the Democrat he spoke to, who shared the conversation on condition of anonymity to discuss a private talk.But then Mr. Biden said something he has not stated so bluntly in public: \u201cBut I don\u2019t see the candidate who can clearly do what has to be done to win.\u201dIn another possible sign that he is preparing to ramp up, an emissary from Mr. Biden recently reached out to James Smith, the Democratic Party nominee for governor in South Carolina last year, about scheduling a call with the former vice president. Mr. Smith, a state legislator and friend of Mr. Biden, said the former vice president could count on an enthusiastic reception in South Carolina if he were to run.\u201cIn the circles that I move, I think there\u2019s almost unanimity of support for him,\u201d Mr. Smith said.But Mr. Smith acknowledged that in Mr. Biden\u2019s absence, others were making moves in South Carolina. Mr. Smith said that after his defeat in November, he had heard from several contenders, including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2014 none of whom, he said, could count on scooping up Mr. Biden\u2019s network.The entry of Mr. Biden would immediately upend the still-nascent primary: Ms. Warren joined the race last week and three dozen other Democrats are considering it. Mr. Biden could crowd out other establishment-aligned contenders like former Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, given that Mr. Biden\u2019s donor base and supporters may overlap with some of their own. And Mr. Biden\u2019s allies are themselves mindful of another Democrat whose blue-collar credentials could pose a challenge to their own coalition: Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio.[With Elizabeth Warren visit, Iowans get the first taste of 2020.]Most of all, a Biden candidacy would also frame the primary around the question of whether Democrats prefer a familiar face and steady continuum of former President Barack Obama\u2019s center-left politics, or a generational change and turn to a more liberal, confrontational approach to Mr. Trump and the right.Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s incendiary conduct and norm-breaking presidency have so imperiled the country that only somebody with the stature and experience of a two-term vice president can bring back stability. And, they contend, Mr. Trump has diminished the importance of ideological differences within the Democratic Party.\u201cVariations in policy positions don\u2019t really matter because, to paraphrase the president, we are in a national emergency \u2014 but the national emergency is him,\u201d said Lou Frillman, who was a major fund-raising bundler for Mr. Obama\u2019s campaigns and is close to Mr. Biden. \u201cThe vice president has all the qualities necessary to win, and I think he has all the qualities the country is going to so desperately need to bring us back from the edge.\u201dMost of all, Mr. Biden\u2019s allies contend, he would be the Democrat most likely to reclaim the battleground state voters who abandoned the party in 2016.\u201cIf you look at Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the labor folks who voted for Trump, they love him,\u201d former Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware said of Mr. Biden. \u201cHe has a connection with these people.\u201dMr. Biden\u2019s enthusiasts are also quick to note that he is not just popular with white working-class voters, but is also well-liked among African-Americans and millennials.ImageDrawing a hug from President Barack Obama, Vice President Biden announced on Oct. 21, 2015, that he would not run for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination after months of speculation.CreditCarlos Barria/ReutersMr. Biden has led in national and early-state polling, drawing about a third of the vote, enough to make him a solid but not overwhelming front-runner at a moment when such surveys are heavily dependent on name identification. He is viewed favorably by the vast majority of Democrats, but some surveys indicate Democrats want fresh faces and new leadership.Mr. Biden would portray himself as a progressive, embracing priorities like free public college tuition and expanding health care, advisers say. But he would also make the case that his 36 years in the Senate and eight years as vice president make him the best qualified to repair the damage they believe Mr. Trump has done at home and abroad.\u201cThis is a guy who actually gets along with Mitch McConnell and a number of other Republicans,\u201d said Mr. Carper, invoking the Senate majority leader with whom Mr. Biden worked closely to negotiate a handful of agreements in the Obama years.Yet the preferences of the party\u2019s donor class and an ability to work in a bipartisan fashion are hardly alluring to the party\u2019s increasingly liberal grass-roots activists and voters. And the candidacy of a Washington Democrat who fondly recalls his relationships with conservatives, and even used his speech bowing out of the 2016 race to make the case that Republicans are the opposition but not the enemy, may be ill-suited for the Trump era.\u201cWe are at a time when we have a combative racist and often unhinged person in the White House, and that\u2019s not going to be answered with somebody who says: Let\u2019s come together and let\u2019s heal and let\u2019s all be gentle souls,\u201d said Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, who supported Senator Bernie Sanders for president in 2016.Part of Mr. Biden\u2019s challenge would be what he represents as a septuagenarian who came of age in a consensus-oriented Senate dominated by white men, some of them segregationists, a political milieu as distant to millennial Democrats as the Civil War.Should he run, Mr. Biden would quite likely face multiple major black candidates and no fewer than three prominent women. After the Democratic base elevated diversity to a first priority in the midterm elections, Mr. Biden would have little to offer voters determined to change the face of the presidency.He would be counting, instead, on Democrats embracing a candidate from an ideologically and culturally traditional caste as an expedient for defeating Mr. Trump.Perhaps just as daunting, Mr. Biden would have to answer for a political record stretching back nearly half a century. He has never faced the level of criticism from his fellow Democrats that he would earn as a leading candidate for president.Mr. Biden has steadfastly supported important liberal priorities over the years, including gun control and labor rights, but he was also a loyal ally of the credit card industry as a senator from Delaware and backed a crime bill in the 1990s that is now seen by liberals as having forged a generation of mass incarceration.In 1991, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Biden presided over the confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas, including the interrogation of Anita Hill by a panel of all-white and all-male senators. And in 2002, he voted to authorize the invasion of Iraq.But he has said before that he is not alarmed about the indignity of ending his storied career by losing a primary.Invoking the 2015 death of his eldest son, Beau, Mr. Biden wrote in his book \u201cPromise Me, Dad\u201d that he understood \u201cthe difference between an electoral loss and real loss.\u201d"}, {"title": "At Hotels, Space That\u2019s Like the Office, \u2018but Cooler\u2019", "category": "Business", "id": "66198a2e-fdb2-407a-99ef-7ab633c5df0f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/business/hotels-co-working-areas.html", "publishdate": 20190107, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/08/business/08ITINERARIES-01/08ITINERARIES-01-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Hotels have already turned their lobbies into spaces where guests can socialize or work. Now, some properties are going one step further to cater to business travelers and professionals in general: They\u2019ve set up WeWork-style co-working areas.Traditional hotel business centers these aren\u2019t. Yes, they offer practical amenities like office supplies, printers and, of course, coffee. But they also have a laid-back ambience and convivial feel of the shared working spaces popping up around the globe under the banner of the start-up WeWork.The new hotel business centers seem to have struck a chord among business travelers who find that they\u2019re probably getting less work done in busy hotel lobbies, said Lorraine Sileo, the senior vice president of research for the travel research company Phocuswright. \u201cLobbies are distracting because there is so much going on, with people coming in and out and also socializing,\u201d she said. \u201cThese new work spaces are meant for productivity.\u201dThey\u2019re also especially attractive to younger business travelers, said Jessica Collison, the research director for the Global Business Travel Association. \u201cMillennials tend be more nomadic than the older generation of travelers and spend more time outside of their room,\u201d she said. \u201cHotels have picked up on this, and more of them are offering a co-working option.\u201dThe AC Hotel Phoenix Biltmore, for example, which opened in October, offers the indoor and outdoor AC Lounge, on the side of its lobby. The more than 5,000-square-foot light gray space has several couches, a large communal table with electrical outlets at every seat and a 20-seat high table that\u2019s a working area by day and a bar after 4 p.m. Guests and non-guests are welcome to use the lounge without charge, said David Belk, the hotel\u2019s general manager, and can get free coffee and biscotti. The lounge\u2019s small library has computers, printers and office supplies like paper clips and folders.ImageThe Revolution Hotel, in Boston\u2019s South End, charges non-guests $20 a day for access to its co-working space.CreditTony Luong for The New York Times\u201cWe want the lounge to be a go-to and convenient for anyone who\u2019s working,\u201d Mr. Belk said.Alex Griffiths, who lives in San Luis Obispo, Calif., and travels to Phoenix frequently for his job in renewable energy, has stayed at the AC several times since it opened and said that he used the lounge both for team meetings and computer work. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fully functioning office but cooler, and I like the synergy with the other people who are also working,\u201d he said. \u201cI also love the biscotti.\u201dThe co-working area at the Charlotte Marriott City Center in North Carolina, called Coco and the Director, is more compact than the AC Lounge. It has two tables with eight seats each and a whiteboard with markers that guests can use during meetings for notes, said Seamus Gallagher, the property\u2019s director of guest experience. It also offers a for-purchase menu of coffee and sandwiches.Although access is free for anyone, seats must be reserved by signing up on the chalkboard near the co-working area entrance. \u201cYou can stay for as long as you want,\u201d Mr. Gallagher said, \u201cand our staff will give you any office supplies you need and help with printing documents.\u201dMatt Nunn, a Seattle resident who works in computer technology, said that he bases himself at Coco and the Director when he\u2019s on work trips in Charlotte. \u201cIt\u2019s nice and quiet in there, and I can spread myself out and hop on conference calls,\u201d he said. Mr. Nunn said he has also invited customers to the space for meetings.Pivot62 at the DoubleTree by Hilton Vail, which opened in March, also offers a co-working space that\u2019s free for guests and non-guests. It has workstations, conference rooms and a kitchen area with free coffee.Hotels see the co-working spaces as a way to build loyalty with both hotel guests and the general public, said Adam Weissenberg, the head of travel, hospitality and leisure at Deloitte. \u201cThese spaces are often sleek looking and help raise a hotel\u2019s profile,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to lose money from them because anyone who uses them is likely to hang out at the hotel when they\u2019re done working and order drinks or food.\u201dImageHeather White, left, and Melisa Valdez of Trillfit, a boutique fitness studio, working at the Revolution Hotel\u2019s space, Conspire.CreditTony Luong for The New York TimesMr. Weissenberg noted that several recently opened hotels that have co-working spaces charge non-guests for access. \u201cThe fees aren\u2019t high, but the amenities they have generally warrant a charge,\u201d he said.The Revolution Hotel, for one, which opened on Dec. 5 in Boston\u2019s South End neighborhood, charges non-guests $20 a day for access to its co-working space, Conspire. The space offers communal tables, bar style seating, couches and an eight-person conference room.

Tim Wu\u2019s recent book, \u201cThe Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age,\u201d argued that failing to break up the newest giant corporations posed a grave risk of repeating the worst excesses of the Gilded Age.Others focus on the remarkable gains in productivity when the United States\u2019 economy finally overtook Britain\u2019s. Alan Greenspan\u2019s \u201cCapitalism in America: A History\u201d stressed that the growth from 1870 to 1896 was not only in wealth but in real wages and living standards.The implications of this historical debate for public policy today makes a recent book on the events that brought the Gilded Age to an end and ushered in the Progressive Era all the more timely and urgent.Jack Kelly\u2019s \u201cThe Edge of Anarchy: The Railroad Barons, the Gilded Age and the Greatest Labor Uprising in America\u201d opens in May 1893 with President Grover Cleveland surveying the half-million citizens who had filled the Chicago World\u2019s Fair, \u201cthe most astounding metropolis ever built.\u201d The Columbian Exposition, as it was known, was a celebration of the 400th anniversary of Columbus\u2019s arrival in the New World as well as \u201cthe productivity of American commerce.\u201d Four days after the fair opened, the bottom dropped out of the United States economy, which was further crippled that summer by \u201can increasingly ferocious depression.\u201dThe resulting economic turmoil provided the backdrop for a series of mass labor actions that are the focus of the book. These began with an unlikely 40-year-old Ohio businessman named Jacob Coxey\u2019s leading a hundred unemployed workers to Washington on foot to petition for a vast infrastructure investment project to alleviate unemployment and remedy the sorry state of the nation\u2019s roads.The improbable prophet picked up many more along the way and motivated multiple independent Coxeyite groups from across the West to make their way East. Although few ultimately completed the journey, and Coxey was arrested and convicted under a law making it a crime to deliver a \u201charangue or oration\u201d on Capitol property, the nation was held transfixed by the progress of the so-called Coxey Armies.The core of \u201cThe Edge of Anarchy\u201d is a thrilling description of the boycott of Pullman cars and equipment by Eugene Debs\u2019s fledgling American Railway Union. The strike caused much of the country\u2019s commerce to grind to a halt, federal troops were called out over the objections of state officials, and many lives were lost. Mr. Kelly closely scrutinizes the roles not only of the American Railway Union and management but of state, local and federal officials, the courts, industry, the press, activists, and labor. No one comes out unscathed.At the heart of the story is the complex figure of George Pullman. A paternalistic but benevolent capitalist, he had built an elegant planned community for his workers complete with parks, a library, a theater and an arcade. In the end, however, he decided that he would rather see the town and possibly the nation burn than accept any limitations on the inherent prerogatives of ownership.The stark contrast between the rather modest concessions sought by the American Railway Union and the magnitude of the conflagration that ultimately erupted is a reminder of how wrong things can go when matters of principle are at stake. Few in power had much sympathy for Pullman\u2019s intransigence, but fewer still were willing to even implicitly question the inviolability of property rights by forcing his hand. Pullman\u2019s position \u2014 \u201cThere is nothing to arbitrate\u201d \u2014 remained steadfast throughout.Among the most eye-opening aspects of \u201cThe Edge of Anarchy\u201d is the description of how government actually worked in that era. The current administration has nothing on Cleveland\u2019s when it comes to conflicts of interest and illicit collusion among the organs of government and business.Attorney General Richard Olney was a railroad lawyer and took the position on the condition that he could continue to represent clients. He remained a railroad board member with Pullman. He conspired with the White House and federal judges to draft the clearly unconstitutional injunction that landed Debs in jail. It was upheld unanimously, despite the fervent advocacy of Debs\u2019s lawyer Clarence Darrow, by the same Supreme Court that would decide Plessy v. Ferguson the next year.As depressing as some of this history is, it does provide hope that our institutions and our spirit are strong enough to survive even the most frontal attacks. When Debs was released from prison, over 100,000 supporters awaited his return to Chicago at Union Station. A commission empaneled to examine the causes of the boycott produced a scathing report that resulted in some of the earliest workers\u2019 rights legislation. And the midterm elections of 1894 made President Trump\u2019s corresponding performance look like a victory: Cleveland\u2019s Democratic Party would go from a 94-seat surplus to a 161-seat deficit and not regain the presidency or either house of Congress until 1910."}, {"title": "From Goldman\u2019s 1MDB Scandal to Bitcoin, Here\u2019s a Look Ahead at 2019", "category": "Business", "id": "24d78c45-2d25-4b3f-999d-a7e3ce58014b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/business/dealbook/goldman-1mdb-bitcoin.html", "publishdate": 20190107, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/08/business/dealbook/08db-henning1/merlin_148256811_a370b959-9aef-4efa-97d0-cf06968aac5a-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________One year ago, Bitcoin was minting millionaires as its value surged to nearly $20,000. Now it is worth about $4,000, and many wonder whether it can survive as a viable investment option, regardless of whether it will ever supplant currencies.In 2018, the special counsel investigation by Robert S. Mueller III kept expanding. With the Democrats in control of the House of Representatives, a raft of investigations of the Trump administration is sure to follow.The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same. Here are some thoughts on topics that should continue to be of interest in 2019:Will Goldman Fight the Government Over 1MDB?After the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs sought to expand into Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, that effort was caught up in a scandal at an investment fund in Malaysia.Goldman raised more than $6 billion for that fund, called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. The money was supposed to benefit the Malaysian public but ended up enriching Goldman and those close to Najib Razak, who was prime minister. In December, the Malaysian government filed criminal charges against Goldman, accusing the firm of violating securities laws there.Those charges come on top of a Justice Department investigation of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars corporations from bribing foreign officials to gain a business advantage. Goldman\u2019s former top banker in Asia, Timothy Leissner, pleaded guilty in August, describing his role in concealing bribes and kickbacks. Charges were also filed against Roger Ng, Mr. Leissner\u2019s former deputy, who is being held in Malaysia pending extradition.The firm initially tried to shake off the charges by claiming that any misconduct was the work of a few rogue employees, but reports that Goldman\u2019s former chief executive Lloyd C. Blankfein met with a key figure in the fraud have undercut that defense.Goldman\u2019s chief executive, David M. Solomon, has offered a full-throated defense of the firm. In a message to employees, he wrote: \u201cWe believe our culture and our processes around our due diligence and compliance was strong at the time, and is even stronger today.\u201dAn American corporation can be prosecuted for the acts of its employees, so Goldman does not have many defenses if prosecutors decide to file charges.Although Goldman has pledged its cooperation, the firm has also claimed that it is innocent of the Malaysian charges and may well be girding for a fight with the Justice Department to limit its liability. Goldman also will have to deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which shares jurisdiction over the bribery law, and the Federal Reserve, Goldman\u2019s chief banking regulator.Goldman has little choice but to reach a settlement. The key question is how much its entanglement with 1MDB may cost the firm. Disgorging the $600 million fee it earned for arranging the bond deals is the likely starting point for any resolution in the United States.How much a potential fine could be on top of that is anyone\u2019s guess. One possibility is that it will be a multiple of Goldman\u2019s profit on the transaction. That could push the penalty over a billion dollars, with the possibility of even more if Goldman has to reach an agreement with the Malaysian government.Do Cryptocurrencies Need a New Regulator?The precipitous fall in the value of cryptocurrencies in 2016 cries out for greater regulation to protect investors. Studies have shown that the market for cryptocurrencies is subject to widespread manipulation, which puts smaller investors at the mercy of those who are trying to profit from the price swings.Two bills were introduced in Congress in December to address manipulation in the cryptocurrency markets. Neither offers a concrete step toward regulating trading platforms, nor do they designate oversight to a single agency.As investors have suffered losses, the questions have increased about whether cryptocurrencies will survive as a viable investment class. Without greater government oversight to curb manipulation, the interest of small investors may well dry up.The Coming InvestigationsControl of the House means Democrats can investigate actions by the Trump administration, and perhaps the president himself. The subpoenas for documents and testimony are likely to fly up Pennsylvania Avenue in much the way they did during the Obama administration after Republicans took control of Congress.But those hoping for a cascade of materials from the Trump administration may be disappointed. Congressional investigations may well run into claims of executive privilege, something previous administrations have used to resist demands for information. That means any dispute of what must be produced will be decided in the federal courts under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Nixon, the Watergate case that found the judiciary has final authority to determine the scope of any claim of privilege.That is not a very expeditious route for a congressional committee to pursue. Any decision is likely to take months. Add to that the likelihood of an appeal, perhaps all the way to the Supreme Court, and it may take two or more years to adjudicate a privilege claim.Corporate DisclosureIn August, President Trump tweeted that he wanted the S.E.C. to change the requirements for companies to issue financial statements from each quarter to twice a year. Publicly traded companies complain that the quarterly reporting requirement feeds into the short-term mentality of the securities markets.The S.E.C. issued a request for comments on Dec. 18 about \u201cthe nature, content and timing of earnings releases and quarterly reports.\u201d Asking for comments is a sure way to slow-walk any potential changes.Reuters reported that some Republicans are frustrated that Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C., has not pushed a deregulatory agenda as aggressively as expected and sided with the two Democrats on the commission with some regularity. Could dissatisfaction with Mr. Clayton cause Congress to take the lead on making major changes to the reporting obligations of companies?Larger companies are unlikely to see any significant alteration of their quarterly reporting obligations, but smaller companies \u2014 which have a broad appeal on Capitol Hill \u2014 may see a change in the frequency and scope of their reporting.The question is whether that will be a positive change for the markets. Less reporting, especially by smaller companies, could allow companies to push the envelope in their financial disclosures and help them avoid, at least for a while, their day of reckoning.With the stock market declining sharply in December and growing concerns about a possible recession, would postponing reporting be good for investors?Corporate America has a strong voice in Washington, so changes in the reporting requirements that put the interests of executives over investors would hardly be surprising.Wishing everyone a happy and prosperous new year!"}, {"title": "Stocks Climb as Investors Look to China-U.S. Trade Talks", "category": "Business", "id": "968a8f74-b2b1-41e1-a50c-5ca7e25df739", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/business/global-stock-markets.html", "publishdate": 20190107, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/08/business/08markets-1/08markets-1-articleLarge-v2.png", "content": "Stocks rose on Monday, buoyed by the efforts of central bankers to ease economic worries, as investors watched for developments in trade talks between the United States and China.Trade negotiators from Washington and Beijing began discussions aimed at reaching an agreement that would end a trade war between the two countries.

Charles Miller, Ben\u2019s father, said he expects to vote for Ms. Warren, but is also intrigued by a Democrat who could be described as her ideological opposite: Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York.\u201cAs Democrats, we haven\u2019t seen a big field like this in a long time,\u201d said the elder Mr. Miller, a 47-year-old resident of Ankeny, Iowa. \u201cAnd as long as they keep it positive, as long as there\u2019s no personal attacks and they just share their views, it\u2019s going to be a good thing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m ready to be convinced.\u201dSuch is the mood of Iowa Democrats, who are currently feeling somewhat spoiled after a visit by Ms. Warren this weekend \u2014 more than a year before a single vote is cast in the state\u2019s caucuses \u2014 unofficially kicked off the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. The party\u2019s 2016 primary was defined by rigid and bitter lanes of Hillary Clinton and Mr. Sanders, but as the 2020 nomination process begins, the state\u2019s voters are giddy at the prospect of a crowded field that could feature more than a dozen candidates across the ideological spectrum.Angry at Wall Street? There\u2019s Ms. Warren, the longtime critic of unrestrained markets and big corporations, but also Mr. Sanders or Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who are both mulling presidential runs. Those eager for a female candidate may be able to choose between Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is expected to announce a presidential campaign this month, and other potential candidates, including Senators Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. At least five of the expected major candidates will support liberal wish-list policies such as Medicare for All.\"There's no magic formula,\" said Allison Kipp, 39, who brought her daughter to a rally for Ms. Warren in Des Moines on Saturday. \"You can't know what Trump will do or say. We need to find someone that inspires\" Democrats.VideoThe Massachusetts senator has said she will run against President Trump in 2020. The two already have a history of trading barbs on a range of topics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Native American ancestry.CreditCreditElizabeth Frantz for The New York TimesThe field of potential 2020 Democratic nominees will be perhaps the most wide open since 1992: with no obvious front-runner to challenge President Trump, and no broadly unifying political ideology as it moves away from decades of dominance by the Clintons and former President Barack Obama. The result is a robust debate about the party\u2019s direction, which some voters believe is overdue.Iowa, because of its first-in-the-nation presidential caucus, has long played in outsized role in determining the outcomes of such political fights. Though other, more diverse states have long complained of its influence, voters in Iowa take pride in being good adjudicators of political sensibilities.Iowans like Ms. Kipp believe the Democratic Party must select the candidate with the boldest vision that energizes base voters, regardless of political constraints. Gary Himes, 70, prefers a more incremental approach. Mr. Himes voted for Mr. Trump in the 2016 general election after a lifetime as a Democrat, and said a candidate like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. can win over former Democrats the party may have lost.\"I wanted change,\" Mr. Himes said, of his 2016 vote. He has now pledged to support the Democratic nominee in 2020 no matter who he or she is. \"I went off track but now I'm back on,\" he said.[Joe Biden\u2019s allies say he sees himself as Democrats\u2019 best hope in 2020.]Throughout Ms. Warren\u2019s weekend tour of Iowa, the first for a declared major candidate, residents and Democratic primary voters said the prospect of a large field had already impacted their decision calculus. Instead of being deferential to a singular preferred candidate, many listed a top tier, considering they felt fondly about several members of the presumed field.Cassandra Flomo, 69, said she expects to use most of 2019 to hear out different candidates, deciding even later in the process than usual.Ms. Flomo said she enjoyed Ms. Warren\u2019s Des Moines rally, but also was intrigued by Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. Ms. Flomo, who supported Mrs. Clinton, said Democrats were \u201ctoo nasty\u201d to each other in the 2016 presidential primary and that she hopes the large field will help damper tensions.\u201cI don\u2019t want any of that in-house fighting,\u201d said Ms. Flomo. \u201cOld people and young people, they were too divided. There just needs to be more inclusion.\u201dImageMs. Warren, along with local and state female leaders, spoke at an event at The District Venue in Ankeny, Iowa, on Sunday.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York Times\u201cI\u2019m looking for a vibe,\u201d said Carolyn Briggs, a 63-year-old Iowan who works at Des Moines Area Community College. \u201cI need to be in the same room as someone and just look into their eyes. There\u2019s just some feeling you get.\u201dShe was attending Ms. Warren\u2019s Des Moines rally on Saturday with her husband, David, who had wanted to watch the speech on television. His wife said no.\u201cIn this state, we\u2019re political animals, and we want to get to know the candidates,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want them to come to our homes and into our schools. Only then: you\u2019ll know.\u201dDuring stops in her five-city Iowa tour, Ms. Warren laid several markers for the Democratic candidates who will soon join her on the trail. She repeatedly called for Democrats to disavow corporate money and self-funding candidates, a warning shot possibly aimed at Mr. Bloomberg. She also repeated several times that the country needs \u201csystemic\u201d and \u201cstructural\u201d changes, a pointed response to the Democrats more focused on beating Mr. Trump than laying out a personal framework.\u201cI think that what our 2020 issue will be is how we talk about what we stand for,\u201d Ms. Warren said Sunday in Ankeny. \u201cOur affirmative vision of how we build a country that reflects our best values. That\u2019s what I try to talk about every chance I get.\u201d\u201cI want to put on the table an idea. And that is we need change \u2014 and not just one statute here or one law there,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need big structural change.\u201dThe ideas impressed Ms. Briggs, the Iowan who told her husband they needed to see Ms. Warren in person. In a text message sent after the rally, she said Ms. Warren gave her the elusive \u201cvibe\u201d she seeks in quality presidential candidates.\u201cShe\u2019s not pedantic. She assumes her audience is intelligent and doesn\u2019t speak down to him,\u201d Ms. Briggs said. \u201cSo far, she\u2019s my number one,\u201d she added \u2014 emphasizing \u201cso far.\u201d"}, {"title": "On Politics: Bolton Puts Conditions on a Syria Withdrawal", "category": "Politics", "id": "0777b029-e804-4656-95c8-f65e9348a56e", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/on-politics-bolton-syria-withdrawal.html", "publishdate": 20190107, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Monday morning.

The rate, which would apply to those earning more than $10 million a year, would be significantly higher than the current top rate of 37 percent, which was lowered in 2017 from 39.6 percent. She explained:\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.\u201dOn Twitter, Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana and the minority whip, called the suggestion an attempt to take \u201chard-earned money\u201d and \u201cgive it to leftist fantasy programs.\u201dMs. Ocasio-Cortez responded by accusing Republicans of \u201cripping off\u201d American workers \u201cfor profit.\u201d Mr. Scalise then said it was \u201cnot productive\u201d to engage with her \u201cradical followers,\u201d and admonished her with a hashtag to \u201c#StayClassy.\u201d\u2022 In the interview with Mr. Cooper, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez called herself a radical and said there was \u201cno question\u201d Mr. Trump is racist.\u2022 She also responded on Friday to footage from her college years showing her dancing barefoot on a rooftop, posting another video of herself dancing into her office in Washington. \u201cI hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cWait till they find out Congresswomen dance too!\u201dBridgewater escapes the 2018 hedge fund doldrumsLast year was rough for hedge funds.But not for Ray Dalio and his Bridgewater firm, which manages $160 billion in assets. The company\u2019s flagship Pure Alpha hedge fund recorded a gain of 14.6 percent last year, easily beating the broader market and rival funds. It was Pure Alpha\u2019s best performance in five years; in 2017, it returned just 1.2 percent.On average, hedge funds lost 2 percent last year through the end of November. \u201cMacro\u201d funds that bet on the direction of the global economy saw returns slide more than 4 percent.Bridgewater attributed its high return in part to a highly diversified strategy.Other hedge fund superstars had a far less successful 2018.The main fund of David Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital lost 34 percent last year, its worst performance since the firm opened in 1996, according to CNBC. Larry Robbins\u2019s Glenview Capital Management suffered a 16 percent decline, in large part because of a hit to the firm\u2019s health care portfolio, the WSJ reported. Third Point, run by Daniel Loeb, took an 11 percent hit. The S&P 500 ended the year down 6 percent.A case of nerves: Wall Street lowers forecasts and seeks safe havensThe Wall Street roller coaster is a ride that many analysts now look to with trepidation, as the bull market approaches its 10th year. Analysts from Citigroup, BMO Capital Markets and Credit Suisse are trimming their forecasts for 2019, according to the WSJ, despite soothing words from the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, about flexible rate policy as well as a blockbuster jobs report on Friday.Major indexes are performing far below their highs, especially after a sharp sell-off in December and Apple\u2019s decision on Wednesday to lower its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than 15 years.Many  investors are considering safe haven assets like the Japanese yen and gold. Analysts are worried that pessimism could result in slumping equities and rising corporate bond yields, which could lower consumer and business confidence and spending.The U.S. central bank, which steered the economy through the financial crisis and its rebound, has its work cut out: It must handle a slowdown in growth while keeping inflation in check and avoiding a recession.ImageApple iPhone XR modelsCreditNoah Berger/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesApple\u2019s boogeyman: A longtime fan in small-town Ohio?Apple blamed China\u2019s slowing economy and growing trade tensions with Washington when it announced last week that it was lowering its revenue forecast.But the NYT\u2019s Kevin Roose thinks the company should be more worried about his mom, a longtime Apple fan and tech-savvy retiree who lives in a small town in Ohio.The problem? She likes her phone \u2014 a three-year-old iPhone 6S \u2014 as well as her first-generation Apple Watch and (relatively) ancient MacBook Air. She\u2019s not looking to upgrade anytime soon. He writes:\u201cThe most consequential hit to Apple\u2019s bottom line may be from people who are holding on to their phones for longer. Back in 2015, iPhones were being replaced after roughly two years, on average, according to BayStreet Research, a firm that tracks smartphone sales. That period has jumped to roughly three years, and is expected to grow even more.\u201dElsewhere in the orchard:\u2022 Apple\u2019s cheapest new model, the iPhone XR, hasn\u2019t done very well, leading the company to cut its production forecast for the device.\u2022 As it shifts from its hardware-first approach into a more services-focused strategy, Apple announced a deal with Samsung, its archrival, to offer iTunes movies and television content on the South Korean company\u2019s television sets. Tomorrow, Samsung is expected to report its first drop in quarterly operating profit in two years, because of slower growth in China.Hoping for a slumpA growing number of venture capitalists are rooting for a market dip to calm the overheated start-up scene.For the past few years, Silicon Valley start-ups have been awash in cash that has allowed them to expand quickly and sell or go public at high valuations. Yet that drove up the costs of deal making for venture capitalists, who often prefer to invest in young companies at lower prices in the hopes of making a bigger return later.Now, some of these investors may get their wish for a market decline. Stocks tumbled late last year, led by tech giants such as Facebook and Apple, amid fears of slowing economic growth and a trade war with China. And so far this year, the stock market has had wild swings, whipsawed by confusing signals including Apple\u2019s disappointing iPhone sales in China and American employers adding more jobs than expected last month.It takes time for choppiness in the stock market to ripple out to the start-up market, but many venture capital investors are already preparing for a downturn. Some are setting aside money to pounce on investments and are preparing to write bigger checks with the expectation that new investors who flooded in recent years would flee. And they are keeping closer tabs on companies that were too expensive to invest in last year.In the U.S., venture capital activity last year sank to a five-year low of 5,536 deals, though funding surged 30 percent from 2017, to $99.5 billion. In Asia, the number of deals and the amount of financing surged.Revolving doorThe surprise announcement that Susan Zirinsky would replace David Rhodes as CBS News president was the latest major personnel change at CBS after the ouster of Leslie Moonves, the company\u2019s longtime chief executive.

Charlie Rose, the anchor of the morning show, was fired in November 2017 after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct. Jeff Fager, the longtime executive producer of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d was fired by Mr. Rhodes in September after he threatened a reporter and colleague looking into allegations of sexual harassment against him. And Ryan Kadro, the executive producer of \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d announced last month that he was departing.Mr. Rhodes\u2019 contract was set to expire early this year but his departure was not expected within the ranks of the news division. In fact, over the last few months, he has been weighing who should replace Mr. Fager at \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d Ms. Zirinsky was the leading candidate for the position. Now, as the first woman to lead CBS News, she will decide who will take over the program.In a Sunday night email to the staff, the acting CBS chief executive, Joe Ianniello, said that Mr. Rhodes \u201cdecided the time is right to move on to new opportunities.\u201dOf Ms. Zirinsky, he wrote, \u201cI can think of no one more equipped than \u2018Z\u2019 for the job, and we are delighted she has welcomed these new responsibilities.\u201dImage\u201cThe world we cover is changing, how we cover it is changing \u2014 and it\u2019s the right time for me to make a change too,\u201d David Rhodes said on Sunday.CreditEugene Gologursky/Getty Images for International Women's Media FoundationMs. Zirinsky, 66, has been with CBS News for more than 40 years and has touched almost every part of the division, from its morning show to its evening newscast and its coverage of the White House before joining \u201c48 Hours\u201d in 1996.

CBS News has an incredible legacy to build on.\u201dSuggesting that ratings could be improved, Ms. Zirinsky added, \u201cThe public\u2019s interest today for news and information is intense, and CBS News is uniquely positioned to expand its reach.\u201dMr. Rhodes, 45, became president of CBS News in 2011. He oversaw several key changes at the network, including at its evening news program and Sunday public affairs programs, as well as a revamp of its morning show. He also introduced the network\u2019s 24-hour digital news channel, CBSN.But CBS News was the subject of an investigation into the larger cultural issues at the company undertaken after the misconduct allegations against Mr. Moonves became public. (Mr. Moonves has denied all the allegations and said any sexual acts he engaged in were consensual.) The investigation, which was conducted by two outside law firms, concluded that though there were several issues that could be improved \u2014 including at \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and in the promotion of women into key positions \u2014 the news division did not have \u201ca toxic work or \u2018frat house\u2019 environment for women,\u201d according to a draft report of the inquiry reviewed by The New York Times.But since Mr. Rose\u2019s firing from the network\u2019s weekday morning show \u2014 and the appointment of John Dickerson to replace him \u2014 ratings for \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d have plummeted.

They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the deal publicly.The latest investment \u2014 which is coming from SoftBank itself, not its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund \u2014 values WeWork at $47 billion, and brings SoftBank\u2019s total investment in WeWork to about $10.5 billion, they said.SoftBank, a Japanese telecom conglomerate led by the billionaire Masayoshi Son, is reinforcing its commitment to WeWork even as the complex relationship between the two companies is under growing scrutiny.SoftBank now has multiple investments in WeWork, including equity positions, warrants and joint ventures. Much of its capital in WeWork is from the SoftBank Vision Fund, which is largely backed by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.Yet after the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which American intelligence agencies believe was directed by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, many in the technology industry are reassessing their willingness to take money from the kingdom.WeWork has emerged as one of the most valuable private companies, even as it continues to lose money. Though WeWork is the clear leader in the emerging co-working industry, it is essentially a commercial landlord, sprucing up office space and leasing it back to commercial clients.In August it reported that it had more than 250,000 paying members, more than double the figure from a year earlier. It is also expanding its enterprise business, leasing large offices to companies like Amazon, Pepsi and Salesforce.Yet WeWork continues to spend far more than it makes. It reported a loss of $723 million for the first half of last year as it built new co-working spaces around the globe. That old-school business model has led many analysts to believe that WeWork is wildly overvalued.\u201cThe valuation is going to take a significant amount of growth to justify it,\u201d said Alex Snyder, senior analyst at CenterSquare, a real estate investment firm in Philadelphia.ImageSoftBank has been a big booster of WeWork, and its total investments in the start-up add up to about $10.5 billion.CreditKoji Sasahara/Associated PressNonetheless, Mr. Son has emerged as one of WeWork\u2019s biggest boosters. As recently as last month, SoftBank was considering a larger investment in WeWork, according to the three people with knowledge of the deal. Under one possibility, SoftBank would have spent $10 billion to buy out all of WeWork\u2019s other investors and injected $6 billion more in the company.But several factors led to a smaller deal, they said. SoftBank proceeded with an initial public offering of its mobile unit in Japan, only to watch shares slide. Market volatility worldwide caused investors to be more cautious. And other WeWork investors were reluctant to sell too many of their shares to SoftBank.The result was a deal, earlier reported by The Financial Times, for SoftBank to invest $2 billion more into WeWork.That brings SoftBank\u2019s total investment in WeWork to $6 billion in the last six months. In August, SoftBank put $1 billion into the company. And in December, SoftBank spent $3 billion for a warrant that gave it the right to buy additional equity in WeWork.In 2017, SoftBank invested about $4.5 billion in the company with a web of deals. It spent $1.3 billion to buy shares from WeWork investors and employees. It injected some $1.7 billion to bolster WeWork\u2019s balance sheet. And SoftBank spent $1.5 billion to take major positions in WeWork\u2019s subsidiaries in Japan, China and the Pacific region.\u201cThey\u2019re our closest partner, and they\u2019ve been extremely supportive,\u201d Artie Minson, WeWork\u2019s president, said of SoftBank in an interview.About $5 billion of the recent investments will go to shore up WeWork\u2019s balance sheet. Much of those funds will be available to WeWork this year, but as much as $1.5 billion will be held back until 2020, according to the three people.\u201cThey are vastly outspending their cash flow position to sustain their growth,\u201d Mr. Snyder said. \u201cYou can do that as long as people are willing to give you the money.\u201dAbout $1 billion of the new investments will be used to buy shares from investors and employees, who will get a chance to cash out. Investors and employees who do sell stock to SoftBank will have their shares valued in the mid-$50s, giving WeWork an implied valuation of just over $20 billion.As WeWork continues its costly expansion plans, it could remain reliant on investors like SoftBank for support. SoftBank, meanwhile, may need to continue supporting WeWork to ensure that the start-up can live up to its lofty expectations.\u201cSoftBank will continue to give them money to justify the money they\u2019ve already put in,\u201d Mr. Snyder said."}, {"title": "For Wales, Nuclear Plant Would Mean New Jobs.

Gates and wire fences are up. Archaeologists are sifting through dirt to document stony dwellings dating from 100 B.C. A technical school is welcoming apprentices eager to learn how to maneuver in high-tech control rooms and operate water-cooling systems.The activity is all tied to a plan by Horizon Nuclear Power to turn this rugged outpost into the home of a plant that could be critical not just to the company, but to the Welsh economy and Britain\u2019s energy future.Horizon, a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi, is in private talks with the British government over how and when it might build a nuclear plant here at the northern tip of Wales. If the parties reach a deal on how the project\u2019s estimated 15 billion pound ($18.95 billion) cost will be paid, this stronghold of Welsh culture will change in ways that residents are just starting to consider.ImageCemaes, Wales. Some residents see the proposed nuclear plant as a chance for rebirth. Others see it as a threat.CreditFrancesca Jones for The New York TimesImageSifting through dirt at the construction site, where previously unknown ancient remains have been uncovered amid infrastructure work.CreditFrancesca Jones for The New York TimesSome people worry about nonstop truck traffic, the blasting of rock and soil, and the waves of outsiders the plant would bring to live and work in the area.Others in northern Wales herald the economic benefit the potentially enormous investment could have. They see the Horizon plant, which is expected to produce enough electricity for 5.5 million homes, as a vehicle for rebirth.The British government, eager for reliable, low-carbon energy to replace aging coal plants and nuclear reactors, has been encouraging. Greg Clark, the business and energy minister, told Parliament in June that the new Wales plant, Wylfa Newydd, was \u201cnext\u201d in Britain\u2019s nuclear \u201cpipeline\u201d and that the government would consider making a \u201cdirect investment\u201d in it with Japanese government agencies.But Horizon and Hitachi executives are frustrated with the pace of the talks. In an interview, Duncan Hawthorne, Horizon\u2019s chief executive, said Hitachi had spent \u201cbillions\u201d of pounds on the project, including the cost of acquiring it from two German utilities in 2012.\u201cIt is a very long and expensive road here,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe next several months will be critical.\u201dHitachi, without providing exact figures, wants government financing from Britain and Japan to help attract outside investors like pension funds that seek long-term income streams. Investments by the governments would also help lower Horizon\u2019s risk rating.The Wylfa Newydd plant, with two giant reactors, would be just the second nuclear plant to be built in the United Kingdom since the 1990s. Once a world leader, Britain\u2019s nuclear industry atrophied after serious accidents in Ukraine and the United States spurred broad resistance to nuclear power.Britain has legally committed to cutting carbon emissions. As a result, the government is reassessing its energy options amid a decline in natural gas from the North Sea oil fields and a decision to phase out the use of coal.Proponents of wind and solar energy say Britain should be putting its money there, but those sources have not been able to match the steady supply of power nuclear energy produces. So nuclear plants are back in vogue. One is being built at Hinkley Point in southwest England, and at least four more are planned.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to conceive that nuclear does not have an important role to play,\u201d said Steve Holliday, a former chief executive of National Grid, the British power system operator.Britain\u2019s renewed interest in nuclear power stands out among Western countries, where such plants have become forbiddingly costly and complex. The challenges were evident in October when Toshiba scrapped plans to build a plant in northern England.Delays and cost overruns at plants being built at Olkiluoto, Finland, and Flamanville, France, have hurt the industry\u2019s reputation elsewhere in Europe. Germany, the region\u2019s top manufacturing power, is phasing out nuclear power. An abundance of cheap shale gas has undercut interest in the United States, although two new plants are in the works.Hitachi is intent on the plant in Wales, Mr. Hawthorne said, because it would provide a key European foothold after the 2011 Fukushima accident dampened interest in Japan. Horizon executives have described the area as an ideal location, with water from the sea to be used in the cooling system and the rocky terrain able to bear the massive concrete structure that nuclear power demands.For Anglesey Island, with a population of about 70,000, the project would provide a huge lift and create around 850 permanent jobs. Many local residents favor it because a smaller nuclear facility on a nearby seaside bluff was a dependable employer for nearly 50 years before closing in 2015.Gareth Winston Roberts, a local councilor who worked at the plant \u2014 known as Wylfa, after the bluff \u2014 before retiring in the 1990s, called it \u201ca godsend.\u201d\u201cIt kept people here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt produced a lot of engineers.\u201dImageGwen Parry-Jones, Horizon\u2019s executive director, left, and Gareth Winston Roberts, a local official, both worked at a smaller nuclear power plant in the area that is mostly closed now. Mr. Roberts called it \u201ca godsend\u201d that \u201ckept people here.\u201dCreditFrancesca Jones for The New York TimesGwen Parry-Jones worked there beginning in 1989. Since April, she has been Horizon\u2019s executive director and is steering the negotiations with the government. For the previous decade, she was an executive at EDF Energy, a French-owned utility that has taken over much of Britain\u2019s nuclear system.\u201cI benefited from having a nuclear power station effectively on my doorstep as a young scientist,\u201d she said. \u201cI strongly feel that we are benefiting from the fact that there is an existing nuclear power station here.\u201dThe need for jobs is obvious. The Wylfa plant still employs some technicians to remove fuel rods, but a local chemical plant closed in 2004 and an aluminum smelter closed in 2009. Britain\u2019s plan to leave the European Union this year could hurt another key employer, the port at Holyhead, a hub for trade with Ireland, an E.U. member.\u201cWe find ourselves in a position where we need that one big project,\u201d said Edward T. Jones, a local cattle farmer who also lectures on economics at Bangor Business School in North Wales.Some local leaders also see the plant as a vehicle for preserving the island\u2019s character.\u201cWe still have got the Welsh language, and it\u2019s quite a strong part of our community,\u201d said Llinos Medi, the leader of the island\u2019s governing council. \u201cWith work we can keep our young people and our culture and our Welsh language.\u201dBut some residents believe the plant could damage the island\u2019s rural charm and hurt tourism. A walk along the pebble beach at Cemlyn Bay, a wildlife sanctuary next to the construction site, suggests why.The old Wylfa plant sits at the beach\u2019s eastern end. Because the new one will be far larger, much of the surrounding landscape must be reshaped to accommodate it. The North Wales Wildlife Trust has been asking that fragile wildlife populations \u2014 thousands of terns nest here every summer \u2014 be taken into consideration.ImageSusan and Simon Walker, local residents who moved to the Cemaes region after retiring. \u201cIt is going to completely spoil the area,\u201d Mr. Walker said of the proposed nuclear plant.CreditFrancesca Jones for The New York Times\u201cIt is going to completely spoil the area,\u201d said Simon Walker, a retired businessman who was on the shore with his wife, Susan, watching his four dogs splash in the water.Last month, in a nod to environmental concerns, the Welsh government said it would review the site preparations. Horizon said it disagreed with the move, which could result in delays.Whether the plant proceeds will probably come down to how it will be paid for.A key yardstick is the Hinkley Point facility in southwest England. The government is financing that plant\u2019s \u00a320 billion cost through a so-called contract for difference, an arrangement that guarantees developers of big energy projects a long-term base rate for the power they produce. If the price of electricity falls below that rate, customers pay higher bills to make up the difference.At Hinkley Point, the British government guaranteed the owners an inflation-indexed price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt-hour for 35 years. That is about 50 percent higher than current energy rates. Not surprisingly, the government has been criticized for potentially saddling consumers with expensive electricity for decades.With Horizon, the British government is pushing for a rate up to 30 percent lower than what it agreed to for Hinkley Point. Mr. Hawthorne of Horizon said he anticipated the Wales plant could provide power at \u201ca significant price reduction\u201d compared with Hinkley Point.ImageThe older nuclear plant in the area, called Wylfa, was built in the 1960s. It was known to many local residents as a dependable employer until it ceased operations in 2015.CreditFrancesca Jones for The New York TimesThe question is whether a British government consumed with the process of leaving the European Union is prepared to move quickly on the Anglesey Island project \u2014 and how pivotal it believes the plant is to its climate change promises."}, {"title": "Commercial Real Estate Transactions", "category": "Business", "id": "1d3f9e6a-411e-4a5a-bae4-0dc31e128fbf", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/realestate/commercial/new-york-commercial-real-estate.html", "publishdate": 20190108, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/09/realestate/commercial/09transFor-Sale/09transFor-Sale--articleLarge.jpg", "content": "FOR SALE$12.95 MILLION85 Pitt Street (between Rivington and Stanton Streets)ManhattanThis six-story walk-up is available in an \u201copportunity zone\u201d on the Lower East Side, which offers a potential break on capital-gains taxes.

No, really. Student debt reached a new height last year \u2014 a whopping $1.5 trillion. A typical student borrower will have $22,000 in debt by graduation, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.Now, Silicon Valley is backing a novel idea that proposes to rewrite the economics of getting an education.The concept is deceptively simple: Instead of charging students tuition \u2014 which often requires them to take out thousands of dollars in loans \u2014 students go to school for free and are required to pay back a percentage of their income after graduation, but only if they get a job with a good salary.The idea, known as an Income Share Agreement, or I.S.A., has been experimented with and talked about for years. But what\u2019s happening at Lambda School, an online learning start-up founded in 2017 with the backing of Y Combinator, has captivated venture capitalists. On Tuesday, Lambda will receive $30 million in funding led by one of Peter Thiel\u2019s disciples, Geoff Lewis, the founder of Bedrock, along with additional funds from Google Ventures; GGV Capital; Vy Capital; Y Combinator; and the actor-investor Ashton Kutcher, among others. The new funding round values the school at $150 million.ImageAshton Kutcher is among the investors kicking money into the latest round of funding for Lambda School, an online education start-up.CreditSteve Jennings/Getty ImagesThe investments will be used to turn Lambda, which has focused on subjects like coding and data science, into a multidisciplinary school offering half-year programs in professions where there is significant hiring demand, like nursing and cybersecurity. It\u2019s an expansion that could be a precursor to Lambda becoming a full-scale university. Lambda is being closely watched by educators, the student debt complex and even Wall Street. Purdue University has developed a version of an Income Share Agreement. And Tony James, executive vice chairman of Blackstone Group, has started the Education Finance Institute and hired James Runcie, former chief operating officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid, to help universities and education systems develop I.S.A. programs.It is an approach meant to treat students as investments rather than cash cows \u2014 a fundamental shift that could finally lift the crippling debt load we routinely push onto students. But it also comes with a peculiar kind of danger: By seeking safe investments, programs like this could cast aside the strides made to expand educational opportunities to higher-risk students and reduce the appeal of educations that focus on noble, but lower compensated, professions.At Lambda, students pay nothing upfront. But they are required to pay 17 percent of their salary to Lambda for two years if they get a job that pays more than $50,000. (Lambda says 83 percent of its students get a job with a median salary of $70,000 within six months of graduating.) If they don\u2019t get a job, or their salary is lower, they pay nothing. Payments are capped at $30,000, so a highly paid student isn\u2019t penalized for success, and if a student loses a job, the payments pause.It is a model that so far has been aimed at vocational education but has the potential to end the crushing cycle of student debt and change the way schools think about students.\u201cIt aligns the incentives fully,\u201d said Mr. Lewis, the venture capitalist. The school is incentivized to only enroll motivated students who won\u2019t drop out; it is incentivized to successfully teach them the skills they will need on the job; it is incentivized to find them a job; and it is incentivized to make sure they are a success once they\u2019re on the job because the school relies on employers to keep hiring its graduates. \u201cThere are no schools that are incentivized to make their students successful anywhere,\u201d said Austen Allred, co-founder and chief executive of Lambda. \u201cThe schools get paid up front, they get paid in cash, whether that\u2019s by the government or whether that\u2019s by an individual doesn\u2019t really matter. At the end of the day, the schools get paid no matter what. \u201cI think in order to create better outcomes the school has to take the hit,\u201d he said.Mr. Allred said he doesn\u2019t see Lambda as a replacement for a four-year education \u2014 yet. \u201cWhat we\u2019re built to do right now is close employment gaps,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you have a field where there is a shortage of employees the obvious place for us to start is by building programs to fill those holes.\u201d Whether this model can \u2014 or should \u2014 be applied to the larger education system remains an open question. It clearly improves the financial incentives for the school and the student. But, if expanded more widely, it could press programs to ignore a traditional liberal arts education, where the earning power is reduced. If a student dreamed of a major in Russian literature, she may struggle to find a school that sees a knowledge of Tolstoy to be particularly marketable.It also means schools may not be willing to take a chance on a promising but higher-risk student.\u201cIs it a bad thing to say that schools are going to be for people who are motivated to succeed in said school?\u201d Mr. Allred asked. \u201cI look at some of the predatory, for-profit educations that just don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a win for anybody, including the students. I think schools should be actively trying to determine who will be successful and that\u2019s part of your job. Harvard does that, right?\u201dCritics of such programs have argued they are a form of indentured servitude. The percentage of income that Lambda takes \u2014 17 percent \u2014 is high, and has even been described as predatory. And Purdue\u2019s program is even more aggressive: It is a loan-like arrangement that could charge high-earning students 250 percent of the cost of their education. But those concerns seem less worrying: Student loan borrowers can already pay enormous amounts of interest, and Lambda\u2019s two years of payments could be far more palatable than the decade or more of monthly bills that are already the norm for most college graduates, who can\u2019t escape them even by filing for bankruptcy.\u201cDepending on how it\u2019s structured I think you could come up with something that\u2019s scalable across four-year universities and schools across the country,\u201d said Mr. Runcie, who was hired to help schools put I.S.A. programs in place.There almost certainly will be obstacles, even with big-money investors capable of providing the kind of cash that makes them easier to surmount. Such programs would have to guard against leaving deserving students behind, and might not work at all outside the high-earning fields of technology and business. But in sticking to the Silicon Valley ethos of breaking the status quo, Lambda may have found a radically new approach to funding education, one that could really work for students, not just for schools and bill collectors. Education Inc. should be taking notes."}, {"title": "Carlos Ghosn, Emerging in Public, Lays Out His Defense", "category": "Business", "id": "aeb55f92-bdc0-4b45-92e3-5fd510329c3f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/business/carlos-ghosn-nissan-defense.html", "publishdate": 20190108, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/09/world/09ghosn1/merlin_148898535_91c8a54d-763c-4edf-b159-8f1e31e8ab1c-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "TOKYO \u2014 Carlos Ghosn and his lawyers are laying out the most comprehensive case yet for his innocence, nearly two months after his arrest shook the auto business and tarnished his reputation as an industry titan.Still, it may not be enough to free him from jail for months, as prosecutors try to build a case against the ousted Nissan Motor chairman and onetime leader of an automaking juggernaut that builds more than 10 million cars annually.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s chief defense lawyer in Japan said on Tuesday that prosecutors had no basis for holding him in jail on allegations that he had improperly transferred personal losses to Nissan\u2019s books, saying that board members had approved the transactions.Late Tuesday, that lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, submitted a request to the court to release Mr. Ghosn from detention on the grounds that Nissan did not ultimately bear any losses and that he was not a flight risk.The moves came hours after Mr. Ghosn appeared in court on Tuesday, his first public appearance since his arrest on Nov. 19. Mr. Ghosn, 64, fought back against the allegations, which include charges that he had failed to report his full compensation from Nissan in filings with regulators. He declared that he had \u201cacted honorably, legally, and with the knowledge and approval of the appropriate executives inside the company.\u201dThe defense sets the stage for what could be a lengthy legal battle between Mr. Ghosn and Japanese prosecutors. And Mr. Ghosn may remain in custody for months. Mr. Otsuru, a former prosecutor, said it was possible Mr. Ghosn could spend up to six more months in jail, as it was typical for Japanese courts to detain suspects until the start of their trials.\u201cThere are documents that have to be investigated in both Japanese and English, which will take time,\u201d Mr. Otsuru said. \u201cSix months will be needed before being able to go to trial.\u201dImageMotonari Otsuru, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s chief defense lawyer in Japan, asked a court on Tuesday to release his client from detention. Mr. Ghosn has been in a Tokyo jail since November.CreditKim Kyung-Hoon/ReutersMr. Ghosn has been in jail since his arrest, throwing into turmoil a vast alliance of Nissan, Mitsubishi Motors of Japan and Renault of France. Nissan, which removed Mr. Ghosn as chairman that month, has said that its investigation into his actions \u201cuncovered substantial and convincing evidence of misconduct,\u201d and that its \u201cscope continues to broaden.\u201dLast month, Mr. Ghosn and Nissan itself were indicted on charges that they had withheld millions of dollars of his income from Nissan\u2019s financial filings for years when he was both chairman and chief executive of the company.Mr. Ghosn and his lawyers portrayed him on Tuesday as a dedicated executive committed to overseeing the alliance. His actions, they said, were disclosed to and approved by other company officials. In his statement to the court, Mr. Ghosn said he had \u201cnever received any compensation from Nissan that was not disclosed.\u201dLate last month, he was rearrested on the allegations that he had improperly transferred investment losses to Nissan, and his detention was extended.Mr. Otsuru said at a news conference that Nissan\u2019s own board minutes showed the company had agreed that Nissan would temporarily provide collateral for Mr. Ghosn when he incurred deep paper losses on foreign exchange investments after the financial crisis of 2008.The board minutes have not been publicly released.In a statement submitted to the court for the hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s defense lawyers described the board minutes as authorizing a Nissan \u201csecretarial section\u201d to enter into foreign exchange contracts \u201cfor the benefit of non-Japanese corporate officers and directors at no cost to the company.\u201dMr. Ghosn, the statement said, had asked the board to pass a resolution with general language that did not specifically include his name so that \u201che would not have to explain the situation where he had to pay for significant losses\u201d as the \u201csuspect, if possible, did not want to have all of the people attending the board meeting to know that he had incurred significant valuation losses.\u201dMr. Otsuru said that Nissan had entered into an agreement with Mr. Ghosn and a bank that had lent Mr. Ghosn money, but that the agreements were explicitly designed to shield Nissan itself from any losses. \u201cAt the time of the transfer being made to Nissan, it was made clear that any losses would be borne by Mr. Ghosn,\u201d Mr. Otsuru said.ImageA guard at the detention center where Mr. Ghosn is being held.CreditBehrouz Mehri/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesThe most recent arrest also focused on allegations that Mr. Ghosn had improperly used Nissan funds to pay a Saudi businessman to provide collateral for Mr. Ghosn\u2019s investment losses. In his court statement, Mr. Ghosn said that Nissan had paid the businessman, Khaled Juffali, for \u201ccritical services that substantially benefited Nissan.\u201dMr. Otsuru told reporters that the businessman, whom he declined to name at the news conference, had provided 3 billion yen (about $31 million at the time) as collateral for Mr. Ghosn in 2009. But he reiterated that Nissan\u2019s payments to the businessman\u2019s company were for legitimate services, such as helping to negotiate disputes with a Saudi distributor or soliciting investments in Nissan.Nissan said in a statement that it was \u201cnot in a position to comment on the content of allegations made by the Tokyo Public Prosecutors Office, or rebuttals of such allegations. The company is complying with requests to aid the discovery process in the ongoing criminal investigation.\u201dMr. Otsuru played down speculation, put forward by Mr. Ghosn\u2019s own children, that the auto executive\u2019s arrest and ouster were the result of a revolt by his former Nissan colleagues.\u201cAs a former prosecutor, I am certain that the prosecution would not investigate a case that, for example, would tilt the scales in favor of a particular side in a Nissan power struggle,\u201d Mr. Otsuru said.He added that Mr. Ghosn had not been asked to sign a confession in Japanese that he did not understand, contradicting an assertion made by Anthony Ghosn, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s son, in an interview with the French newspaper Journal du Dimanche over the weekend.\u201cNot once has Mr. Ghosn expressed concerns about being asked to sign anything that he doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d Mr. Otsuru said.Anthony Ghosn declined to comment, according to Devon Spurgeon, a spokeswoman for the family.Since he was arrested coming off his corporate jet, Mr. Ghosn has been kept in a small cell in Tokyo, where he is not allowed to speak with his family and is limited to talking with diplomats and his Japanese lawyers. His lawyers cannot be present when prosecutors question him.Mr. Otsuru said he met with Mr. Ghosn for about two and a half hours every day.\u201cHe is a very logical person,\u201d Mr. Otsuru said. \u201cHe wants to use this time as effectively as possible. He doesn\u2019t speak with us about whether his room is small or his bed is uncomfortable.

Lampert, an opportunity to sweeten his $4.4 billion offer to acquire Sears and keep its roughly 400 stores operating.Mr. Lampert, a hedge fund manager who took control of Sears in 2005, is now expected to officially bid for the company at a court-supervised auction next week.Mr. Lampert, the company\u2019s largest shareholder, is the only bidder seeking to acquire Sears and maintain it as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d The other option under consideration entails selling off all of the company\u2019s real estate, inventory, intellectual property and other assets.The company\u2019s largest creditors will ultimately decide whether they would recover more money by letting Mr. Lampert keep the company going or by selling Sears off piecemeal.On Friday, Sears determined that Mr. Lampert\u2019s bid was not adequate, which led analysts and investors to believe that the retailer was headed toward a fire sale.But lawyers for a committee of independent directors and Mr. Lampert negotiated through the weekend and Monday in an effort to save the company.

They assert that he has sought to enrich his hedge fund, by selling or spinning off some of the company\u2019s most valuable assets. Mr. Lampert denies those accusations and has said he has \u201ctaken a huge personal hit\u201d on the investment and time he committed to the company.Creditors could threaten litigation in an effort to force Mr. Lampert to improve his bid even further at next week\u2019s auction.[Read more about how Mr. Lampert cut his losses in Sears.]"}, {"title": "On Politics: Americans Feel Shutdown\u2019s Bite", "category": "Politics", "id": "4af0e0f2-64a2-4089-bfc7-4942aa51373a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/politics/on-politics-government-shutdown-impact.html", "publishdate": 20190108, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Tuesday morning.

On Tuesday, he also seemed to brandish a stick.Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s leader, arrived by train in Beijing on Tuesday to meet with Mr. Xi during the second day of talks nearby between midlevel trade negotiators from China and the United States. Though the government said the events were unconnected, Mr. Kim\u2019s surprise visit was an unmistakable reminder that China could complicate the Trump administration\u2019s pursuit of other goals \u2014 including ridding the North of nuclear weapons \u2014 if the two powers fail to strike a deal on trade.The trade talks were originally set to wrap up Tuesday, but wound up being extended into Wednesday. The two sides are laboring to finish a deal before March 2, when higher American tariffs will kick in and escalate the trade war.Mr. Kim\u2019s arrival was the clearest sign yet that China is looking for ways to prod the United States to settle the dispute quickly. China\u2019s economy has slowed significantly. Both business and consumer confidence have fallen. Car sales have plunged. Weak smartphone purchases contributed to Apple\u2019s warning last week that its sales figures would be lower than expected because of results from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.The trade war isn\u2019t the only reason for China\u2019s slowdown, but it is making the slump worse.\u201cThe trade war, in addition to its direct costs, has created huge uncertainties for exporters and importers, producers, consumers, entrepreneurs and investors,\u201d Fred Hu, the founder of a large private equity firm in Hong Kong, said at a UBS conference in Shanghai on Monday.By contrast, the Trump administration\u2019s trade hawks see China\u2019s offers so far as inadequate, people with detailed knowledge of the talks said last week.The trade hawks have been pushing China to add more specifics to what they have characterized as nebulous promises to improve intellectual property protection, to limit government subsidies and to stop putting pressure on American companies to transfer valuable technology to China.With Chinese and United States officials meeting to discuss how to end their trade war, North Korea\u2019s recalcitrance could provide China with badly needed leverage. Mr. Trump\u2019s key strategy on North Korea \u2014 using sanctions to apply \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d to the isolated country \u2014 relies on Chinese cooperation, as more than 90 percent of North Korea\u2019s external trade passes through China, and has at times been financed by China as well.\u201cKim is eager to remind the Trump administration that he does have diplomatic and economic options besides what Washington and Seoul can offer,\u201d said Harry J. Kazianis, an expert on North Korea and the director of defense studies at the Washington-based Center for the National Interest, referring to the United States and South Korea.Mr. Kazianis noted that the trip to Beijing by Mr. Kim followed a New Year\u2019s Day speech in which he threatened to find a \u201cnew way\u201d of defending his country\u2019s interests if Washington persisted with sanctions.\u201cThat should make America quite concerned,\u201d Mr. Kazianis said, \u201cas China could easily turn Trump\u2019s \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 strategy into nothing more than a memory, as almost all North Korea\u2019s external trade flows through China in some capacity.\u201dThe strategy isn\u2019t a surefire one. In the past, Chinese officials have refused to link trade disputes with national security issues. While doing so could give them a bargaining chip, it also runs the risk of provoking the White House\u2019s national security hawks and making Mr. Trump take an even harder line. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that Chinese officials had made clear that North Korea and trade were separate issues.ImageMembers of the American trade delegation in Beijing on Tuesday. The two sides are laboring to finish a deal before March 2.CreditWu Hong/EPA, via ShutterstockBy contrast, the Kim strategy could also be ineffective because Mr. Trump has essentially declared victory in North Korea and has said he is in no rush to achieve the goal of denuclearization.At a daily news briefing on Tuesday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said the talks were unrelated. \u201cChina has many diplomatic events, and our diplomatic schedule is very full,\u201d Mr. Lu said. \u201cIf there are some overlaps, it is also natural.\u201dThe broad outlines of a potential trade deal have been visible ever since Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi met in Buenos Aires on Dec. 1. In that compromise, the United States agreed not to impose further tariff increases, but to keep the tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed last summer in a series of categories deemed important to American national security or economic security. Those included nuclear reactor components, cars, and various gears and pumps needed by many industries.China has since made other offers, such as stronger protections for intellectual property and foreign companies\u2019 trade secrets. It could also further cut its tariffs on global imports, experts say. Still, it could be difficult to get the United States to come to a full agreement.While Mr. Trump is now expected to attend the World Economic Forum this month in Davos, Switzerland, his administration has resisted Chinese efforts to schedule any formal trade negotiations then. The administration has also sought to delay an expected visit by Vice Premier Liu He, China\u2019s economic czar and an important figure in the talks, to Washington for further trade negotiations until after Mr. Trump delivers his State of the Union address on Jan. 29.The problem for Beijing is that such a delay would mean that any progress from Mr. Liu\u2019s visit would come too late to fortify consumer confidence before China\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday, which begins on Feb. 4. The weeks before the holiday typically bring a binge of consumer spending; they are often among the biggest weeks of the year for car sales, for example.So Mr. Kim\u2019s visit gives China a chance to show that it still has something the United States wants.Mr. Kim officially remains committed to working toward the \u201ccomplete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d a promise he first made when he met with Mr. Trump in Singapore in June. But his government insists that the denuclearization must also include the removal of all American nuclear threats from the peninsula and its vicinity, including Washington\u2019s nuclear-capable strategic weapons and its joint military exercises with South Korea.Mr. Kim also insists that his country has done enough to win Washington\u2019s initial trust by freezing its nuclear and missile tests and returning the remains of American war dead. He is now refusing to take more crucial steps toward denuclearization until the United States reciprocates by easing sanctions.China says it remains committed to enforcing a series of sanctions the United Nations Security Council has adopted with its endorsement. But in recent months, China has begun calling for easing the sanctions as an incentive for the North to move faster toward denuclearization. In November, a United States congressional commission warned that China appeared to have already relaxed sanctions enforcement.Since Mr. Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day speech, analysts have wondered about what he meant when he threatened to \u201cfind a new way\u201d if Washington refused to ease sanctions. Some saw it as a veiled threat to resume the nuclear and long-range missile tests North Korea has suspended since late 2017.But others said North Korea was trying to play a balancing game between China and the United States, capitalizing on the trade war.Writing for 38 North, a website specializing in North Korea, R\u00fcdiger Frank, an expert on the country at the University of Vienna, said Mr. Kim\u2019s message to Mr. Trump came down to this: \u201cYou are not our only option for security and economic development. If you refuse to be cooperative, we will ignore you and turn to China.\u201d"}, {"title": "China Offers Trump a Trade Peace Deal.

It is offering to keep its hands off valuable corporate secrets, while also allowing foreign investors into more industries than ever before.Beijing hopes all of that will be enough to let President Trump declare victory and end the trade war between the two largest economies. But the offer combines some real concessions, like lower tariffs, with nebulous promises, and it will be hard to ensure that China sticks to its commitments.That could make it a tough sell in Washington. The Trump administration\u2019s trade hawks are still pushing for a lot more, while even the doves fret that the new promises need effective enforcement to make sure that China follows through, according to people with a detailed knowledge of American policymaking.Many American officials and businesses complain that China has long wiggled out of commitments \u2014 accusations that China denies. And the more hawkish wing of the administration contends that Beijing\u2019s assurances have been so vague that it is hard to discern any meaningful progress, a position some analysts support.Beijing\u2019s effort so far adds up \u201cto a modest adjustment of Chinese foreign economic policy,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, \u201cbut nowhere close to the great leap in liberalization that the U.S. and others are seeking.\u201dMidlevel trade talks this week in Beijing, which will continue into Wednesday, have been productive. But if negotiators do not come to a deal in the coming weeks, the administration is poised to raise American tariffs on $200 billion a year in Chinese-made goods on March 2, amping up the trade war at a time when China faces rapidly softening growth and the American economy is facing headwinds.It is not clear whether the moves will fully satisfy Mr. Trump. The American stock market, one of the president\u2019s favorite barometers, has slumped in part over trade tensions. And further market gyrations could prompt the president to declare victory, even if China does not give up too much.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said in a message on Twitter that the talks were \u201cgoing very well,\u201d a sign that Beijing was at least moving in what he considered the right direction.China added a complicated new variable to the trade talks on Tuesday by inviting North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to Beijing. The invitation could increase pressure on Mr. Trump to reach a deal soon, but it might also antagonize national security hawks in his administration who worry about North Korea\u2019s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs.The White House has said China is an unfair trading partner. Its tariffs are too high, it says. It forces American companies to give up important technology to Chinese partners as a price for doing business there. It offers subsidies and cheap loans to Chinese companies that hope to compete with American companies in strategic areas like jetliners, semiconductors and electric cars.Chinese officials dispute those claims. They say higher Chinese tariffs and strict investment limits are justified because China is still a developing country and well behind the United States in many economic respects. China\u2019s manufacturing capabilities, they say, need upgrading for the country\u2019s continued growth. They have consistently denied that the government allows forced technology transfers, saying some companies willingly share and make big profits in China doing so.Still, China has begun to budge. Last month, it dropped retaliatory measures on American-made cars and resumed purchases of American soybeans. It has also reduced tariffs on more than 700 categories of goods from around the world.Beijing has said it is considering a law that would forbid local Chinese officials to demand foreign companies transfer their technology to Chinese businesses through licensing agreements or joint ventures. It has also promised to open up more fully some sectors of the economy, such as vehicle manufacturing and brokerages, to foreign investors. The efforts, Beijing believes, will help the Chinese economy even as they placate Mr. Trump.On cars and soybeans, American negotiators can claim some measure of victory. Soybean purchases have yet to reach earlier volumes, however, while Chinese imports of American-made cars are quite small since many are already made in China.ImageIn addition to buying American soybeans again, China has cut retaliatory tariffs on cars made in the United States and made other efforts. A new round of trade talks begins this week.CreditChristopher Smith for The New York TimesBut China had imposed measures on soybeans and cars to retaliate against American tariffs last summer on $50 billion of Chinese goods. By dropping them, without requiring the United States to abandon theirs, China is signaling that for now it is willing to accept higher American tariffs on some of its goods, provided they are not applied more broadly.China\u2019s other peace offerings are more ambiguous.Chinese lawmakers last month released a draft of a proposed law that would stop local officials from forcing foreign companies to transfer their technology as a cost of doing business. The Trump administration says that Chinese industries like cars and aviation have benefited from American technology.The law may not change things meaningfully, said Donald Clarke, a specialist in Chinese law at George Washington University. The draft is vaguely worded, he said, and doesn\u2019t acknowledge that the pressure American companies face to share their know-how often comes from behind-the-scenes maneuvering rather than strict government requirements.As with many laws in China, it could also be moot if local governments decide not to enforce it or if penalties are not stiff enough.\u201cThese forced tech transfers that people complain about don\u2019t occur because some government department issues an order saying, \u2018Transfer this tech,\u2019\u201d Mr. Clarke said in an email.\u201cIt\u2019s done through the government department getting involved behind the scenes in the negotiations, or not granting discretionary permission to do something unless some tech is transferred. It\u2019s very hard to stop through a specific rule.\u201dStill, Chinese analysts say the pledges are significant. Chinese laws and regulations are often succinct \u2014 only a page or two when American laws or regulations would require dozens or even hundreds of pages. The real work lies in carrying out the regulations, and Beijing is now prepared to impose the new rules diligently, Chinese analysts say.The issue of forced technology transfer \u201cis a longstanding complaint by American businesses in China, and we are addressing it through legal adjustments,\u201d said Tu Xinquan, the executive dean of the China Institute for World Trade Organization Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. \u201cSo no matter what, there will be a positive impact to some extent, that is, in reducing America\u2019s dissatisfaction with China.\u201dChinese officials are also taking steps to strengthen intellectual property protections against counterfeiters and piracy. Chinese officials last month submitted a draft amendment to the country\u2019s patent law that would raise the level of damages and fines for willfully infringing on patents.One of the biggest beneficiaries might be companies in China. Big Chinese players have increasingly shed their reputation as copycats and have developed sophisticated technologies, and complain that local businesses can too easily steal their ideas.\u201cTo be honest, in many areas, there is still insufficient motivation for innovation,\u201d said Ma Yu, a research scholar in foreign investment research at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation. \u201cSo I don\u2019t view these moves to be concessions or compromises, let alone harmful to us.\u201dThe biggest sticking point in China\u2019s package of concessions to the White House may be Made in China 2025, a government plan for developing high-tech industries. The Trump administration has repeatedly criticized the plan, saying it is evidence that China unfairly supports its own companies over foreign competitors in the Chinese market.China has played down the catchy Made in China 2025 name. But there\u2019s no concrete reason to believe that Chinese companies have halted or reversed their plans, or that officials are any less interested in plowing money into its state-owned enterprises. China\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which played a major role in the program, said last month that it would continue to support development of new manufacturing processes, without mentioning the policy by name.Jake Parker, vice president for China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council, an American business group, said that \u201cit\u2019s positive that China is taking steps proactively.\u201dBut he also said that China had yet to completely fulfill its promises on issues ranging from opening up its market to credit-rating agencies and American banks to accepting credit card companies\u2019 efforts since 2001 to offer full, nationwide service.\u201cAre more statements going to be enough to move the needle for President Trump?\u201d Mr. Parker asked. \u201cI think it would have to be a lot more robust than another policy. I don\u2019t think this meets that bar.\u201d"}, {"title": "Anchors Scramble to Fact-Check Trump After Prime-Time Address", "category": "Business", "id": "bf13d6d0-2b30-492c-b403-1d33d87d0099", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/business/media/networks-trump-address.html", "publishdate": 20190108, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/09/business/09trumpmedia-print/merlin_148925619_f14eb3de-e097-431e-84c6-cd2060d13da8-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Moments after President Trump concluded his Oval Office remarks on border security on Tuesday, the NBC anchor Chuck Todd came on air with a blunt assessment.\u201cHe made a lot of dubious claims,\u201d Mr. Todd informed millions of viewers after the network\u2019s scheduled program \u2014 a new episode of an Ellen DeGeneres-hosted game show \u2014 had been pre-empted for a rare prime-time presidential appearance.Shepard Smith, on the Fox network, told viewers that contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s assertions, \u201cstatistics show there is less violent crime by the undocumented immigrant population than by the general population.\u201dAnd on ABC, the White House correspondent Cecilia Vega took issue with Mr. Trump\u2019s depiction of a southern border in crisis. \u201cJust because you say it\u2019s a crisis,\u201d Ms. Vega said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily make it one.\u201dThe decision by major broadcast networks to carry Mr. Trump\u2019s  address live set off a fierce debate over journalistic responsibility in an age of unusual mendacity in politics. Anchors responded by delivering a tough-minded assessment of his nine-minute remarks, reeling off several immediate correctives to some of his misleading claims.The president who appeared on Tuesday night was a far cry from his most famous prime-time incarnation, the gregarious host of \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d Less comfortable in formal settings, Mr. Trump struggled at times reading from his teleprompter, adopting a mostly flat affect.Granting a president airtime to address the nation is normally an easy decision for network executives. But Mr. Trump\u2019s public statements have been marked by untruths and misleading claims, and liberals wondered why news outlets would defer to a president who on Monday labeled journalists \u201cthe Enemy of the People\u201d and \u201ccrazed lunatics.\u201dEventually, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox agreed to the White House\u2019s request, forgoing their 9 p.m. entertainment shows \u2014 and millions of dollars in associated ad revenue \u2014 for the appearance. The networks also broadcast a response from the Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, and Chuck Schumer, the senator from New York.The decision was controversial and predictable at the same time.Executives at the major networks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions, cited the government shutdown \u2014 and the millions of Americans affected by it \u2014 as the primary reason for airing the president\u2019s remarks. This was also Mr. Trump\u2019s first formal request that the networks carry a prime-time address, a rarely used arrow in the presidential quiver.\u201cWhen the president of the United States asks for time to make an address to the American public, I don\u2019t think you can say no,\u201d Ted Koppel, the longtime ABC anchorman, said in an interview. Any concern about misleading claims, he added, \u201cis a judgment you can only make after you hear what he has to say.\u201dOthers argued that traditional ways of covering the president should not apply to the norm-breaking Mr. Trump. Former aides to President Barack Obama pointed out that his request for airtime in 2014 to discuss immigration reform was turned down by the networks, which called the subject overly political. One aide, Dan Pfeiffer, wrote on Twitter after Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks on Tuesday night that \u201cthe Networks got played.\u201dStill, producers at several networks cited the uncertainty surrounding the shutdown, and an impending suspension of federal paychecks, as inherently newsworthy.Executives were juggling a slew of concerns, some tied to public responsibility and others crassly commercial. Tuesday is a relatively slow night for prime time, so airing the president\u2019s address would not pre-empt a ratings magnet like a National Football League game. Executives in New York are mindful of their national affiliates, many of which cater to red-state audiences that might be antagonized to discover their local station is declining to show Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.Even as the news landscape has fractured, the four major networks still have the biggest audience in mass media. Some journalists had questioned if a different approach was necessary.\u201cThere are so many sources of news now, but the networks\u2019 policies haven\u2019t changed very much,\u201d Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News, said before the speech. \u201cOne very attractive option would be to promote the fact that it\u2019s live with a crawl, and then if it turns out to be newsworthy, you can do a special report. You then pull selected sound from it and give it context, as opposed to having to get trapped in something and having to react to it.\u201dFor those who sought counterprogramming on Tuesday, one former Trump associate offered an alternative.\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for anything even remotely worth watching tonight at 9pm EST, I will be folding laundry in my underwear for 8 minutes on Instagram live,\u201d Stormy Daniels, the adult film actress who has claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump, wrote on Twitter. She followed through on her promise in a streaming video featuring the sounds of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cAnother Brick in the Wall.\u201dAs for Mr. Trump, his preparations for prime time went beyond the usual speechwriting.At a White House lunch with television anchors on Tuesday, the president was in a cheery, chatty mood. But according to two people in the room, he frowned when a hefty slice of chocolate cake arrived for dessert.\u201cThat\u2019s going to look good on me tonight,\u201d Mr. Trump joked, declining to partake."}, {"title": "Some Workers Need Jobs as Much as Builders Need Workers.

Living in the working-class neighborhood of Hunters Point, he heard about a program that was training residents to build the Chase Center, the $1 billion, 18,000-seat arena in Mission Bay that will be the new home of the Golden State Warriors when it opens this fall.Mr. Gaviola, 33, applied to the program, was accepted and completed six weeks of training in early September. He then began working at the arena and was recently installing insulation and acoustical ceiling tiles above the Warriors\u2019 practice court.\u201cI\u2019m very fortunate to have a job and be part of this,\u201d he said. \u201cI was doing little delivery jobs, just to get by with the bills, and was really close to being homeless.\u201dMr. Gaviola\u2019s experience mirrors that of hundreds of others nationwide as demand for construction labor outstrips supply. Eighty percent of contractors were having trouble finding skilled workers, according to a national survey released last year by the Associated General Contractors of America trade group and the software designer Autodesk.Competition for workers over all has been heating up. December was one of the strongest months of job gains in the last decade, with employers adding 312,000 to payrolls, the Labor Department reported on Friday.Facing a tight labor pool, developers, public officials and community organizations are using commercial projects to provide residents with careers in construction. Together, they\u2019re making an effort to recruit men and women from impoverished neighborhoods or challenged populations, such as former prison inmates. In booming markets like San Francisco, Denver and Miami, where gentrification is squeezing affordable housing, demand for these types of programs is growing.ImageJPMorgan Chase, which bought the San Francisco arena\u2019s naming rights, has contributed $350,000 for training courses.CreditJim McAuley for The New York TimesThe training programs are also occurring in smaller markets. In Milwaukee, for example, Gorman & Company, an apartment developer, has teamed up with city, state and community agencies to give former inmates on-the-job training restoring dilapidated, tax-foreclosed homes, which are then rented to low-income earners.\u201cThere\u2019s a very limited number of jobs that people re-entering society can do, but they are key to our success,\u201d said Ted Matkom, president of the Wisconsin market for Gorman. \u201cThey can earn a good wage and are motivated.\u201dIn some cases, contractors are required to meet local hiring targets, particularly on big projects that include incentives or are providing a public benefit. Cities and community organizations are recruiting and training workers to help builders meet the thresholds.In addition to classes, the programs typically provide tools, boots and other equipment to the candidates, and they pay for items such as apprentice application fees, child care and gas. Case managers at the organizations even make sure newly employed graduates receive wake-up calls.The developers of Chase Center are getting a hand from San Francisco\u2019s CityBuild Academy, a program that has trained about 1,400 workers since it was introduced in 2006. Among other services, the academy provides 18 weeks of training for apprenticeships in partnership with City College of San Francisco. JPMorgan Chase, which acquired the naming rights to the arena, has also kicked in $350,000 to fund special training courses.To date, those programs and others have provided union apprenticeships to 81 graduates, according to representatives from CityBuild and the National Basketball Association\u2019s Warriors. The workers can make hourly wages of $20 to $30, not including overtime, said Joshua Arce, director of work force development for San Francisco.ImageThe developers of the Chase Center are working with CityBuild Academy, which has trained about 1,400 workers since 2006.CreditJim McAuley for The New York Times\u201cThese are the kind of wages you need to rent an apartment or to save over the long term to buy a home,\u201d Mr. Arce said. \u201cThis is a way to get in front of displacement and address San Francisco\u2019s housing affordability crisis.\u201dFor taxpayer-funded projects, San Francisco requires that local workers perform 30 percent of overall work hours and 50 percent of apprentice hours. The rules do not apply to privately funded projects, but some developers, like those building the Chase Center, also agree to strive for those goals, Mr. Arce said.Similarly, developers of the downtown Miami Worldcenter agreed to hire 10 percent of their skilled workers and 30 percent of their unskilled workers from Miami-Dade County, with an emphasis on recruiting from the nearby neighborhoods. That was in return for nearly $90 million in incentives to help fund the first phase of the 27-acre, $3 billion luxury residential, office, hotel, entertainment and retail project.The new state minimum wage is $8.46 an hour, but developers agreed to pay starting hourly wages of at least $11.58 or $12.83, depending on whether health insurance is included.\u201cEven though employment is strong in Miami, these jobs offer a great opportunity for folks because they can move up the ladder as they meet certain criteria,\u201d said Daniel Kodsi, a principal of Paramount Ventures, developer of the $600 million Paramount Miami Worldcenter condominium tower, which is scheduled to open this year.In addition to spearheading job fairs and other initiatives to recruit workers, the local community redevelopment agency used a federal grant to provide training to 30 students through Miami Dade College. Henry Crespo Sr., president of the Development Firm in Miami, a diversity and inclusion hiring consultant on the project, said another training program was being planned.\u201cThe idea is not only to steer residents toward the Worldcenter project,\u201d Mr. Crespo said, \u201cbut to also give them the ability to find a career path through construction.\u201dIn Denver, work is about to begin on the $765 million redevelopment of the National Western Center, home to the 113-year-old National Western Stock Show.The project, which is being funded by a voter-approved permanent extension of a 1.75 percent tax on hotels and car rentals, will transform about 250 acres northeast of downtown into a campus for the agricultural organization and its livestock, horse and rodeo events held each January. It will also serve as a hub for education and research on food, water, livestock health, and other agricultural and environmental issues.The redevelopment is expected to create 1,000 construction jobs, and the city is requiring contractors to recruit in nearby low-income neighborhoods and to reach out to veterans and former prison inmates, said Gretchen Hollrah, executive director of the Mayor\u2019s Office of the National Western Center. WorkNow, an 18-month-old platform of the Center for Workforce Initiatives at the Community College of Denver, is providing hiring support and training for the project and others.\u201cThere are many construction projects in Denver that have really intensified the need for an expanded pipeline of workers,\u201d said Katrina Wert, director of the Center for Workforce Initiatives. \u201cWe want to reach populations that haven\u2019t shared in the city\u2019s recent growth and prosperity.\u201dIn 2017, WorkNow began recruiting workers for a $1.2 billion, 10-mile overhaul of Interstate 70 in Denver. With the help of $1 million from a philanthropy tied to the Colorado oilman Sam Gary, the organization placed 56 workers into registered apprenticeships and provided 190 experienced construction workers with additional training in its first fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30.Che Derrera found his way to WorkNow in October. He had difficulty landing work in his previous professions when he was released from prison in early 2018 after serving eight years. But Mr. Derrera, 45, is now an apprentice replacing traffic signals and setting up temporary lights at the I-70 project, and he continues to enhance his skills, including training for hazardous operations and emergencies.\u201cThis opportunity is a steppingstone \u2014 not to erase my choices in the past, but to build from them and ensure I don\u2019t have any setbacks,\u201d Mr. Derrera said. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to earn a good income and have long-term stability.\u201d"}, {"title": "On Politics: Trump\u2019s Prime-Time Gamble", "category": "Politics", "id": "14d4f7ca-0f35-47bb-bd5c-535e6a6bf010", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/us/politics/trump-immigration-speech.html", "publishdate": 20190109, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Wednesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today._____________________\u2022 President Trump doubled down on one of the biggest gambles of his presidency with a televised appeal to pressure Congress into paying for his long-promised border wall. It was his first prime-time Oval Office address, a strategy that he himself privately disparaged as unlikely to work.\u2022 The nine-minute speech made no new arguments but included multiple misleading assertions. The Times fact-checked the president\u2019s remarks.\u2022 The Times sent correspondents to the four states bordering Mexico and found few who shared the president\u2019s sense of alarm. Many said there was indeed a humanitarian crisis unfolding \u2014 but they blamed the Trump administration for worsening it.\u2022 President Trump has repeatedly warned that terrorists are pouring into the United States from Mexico. But his own government\u2019s assessments conclude that Mr. Trump has seriously overstated the threat.\u2022 This week would have been payday for 800,000 federal workers across the country. But as the shutdown drags on, no paychecks are arriving to replenish their savings or pay down their maxed-out credit cards.\u2022 A formatting error by Paul Manafort\u2019s defense lawyer revealed that Mr. Manafort, a top official in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, discussed internal polling data during the 2016 race with a man tied to Russian intelligence.\u2022 Former felons in Florida have begun registering to vote, after the approval in November of a historic ballot measure that restored the voting rights of as many as 1.5 million people.\u2022 The Supreme Court refused to intercede in a mysterious fight over a sealed grand jury subpoena that may be part of the Mueller inquiry.\u2022 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey refused to meet John Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, saying that Mr. Bolton made a \u201cgrave mistake\u201d when he said that Turkey must agree to protect Syria\u2019s Kurds in the event of an American withdrawal.\u2022 Emboldened House Democrats, seeking a politically charged debate on gun control, unveiled legislation to expand background checks to nearly all firearms purchases.\u2022 The federal budget deficit continues to rise and is on pace to top $1 trillion for the 2019 fiscal year, as increased revenue from Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs fails to keep up with losses from his signature corporate tax cuts.\u2022 Writing his first Supreme Court opinion for a unanimous court, Justice Brett M.

He had made deliberate preparations in recent months to seek the White House, running television ads in the early primary states, recruiting potential staff members and even designating a campaign manager for a possible run.But Mr. Steyer began informing aides early this week that he would not be a candidate after all, after concluding that he could have a greater political impact through his impeachment activism, several advisers to Mr. Steyer said. Mr. Steyer intends to spend at least $40 million on impeachment efforts in the coming year \u2014 money that might otherwise have been directed toward a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.\u201cMost people come to Iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president,\u201d Mr. Steyer said in prepared remarks, which were obtained by The New York Times. \u201cBut I am proud to be here to announce that I will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president.\u201dAlluding to Mr. Trump\u2019s Oval Office address on Tuesday night, in which he demanded the construction of a border wall, Mr. Steyer said the president had \u201conce again lied to the American people, repeatedly, for his own political skin.\u201d He described Mr. Trump as having already committed numerous offenses warranting his removal from office, and warned Democrats that shying away from an impeachment battle would serve to \u201cenable\u201d the president.Mr. Steyer, 61, left himself some wiggle room to change his mind on 2020, saying in prepared remarks that he had decided against running \u201cat this time.\u201d But his announcement ended \u2014 at least for now \u2014 the latest of several flirtations with seeking high office, which have also included abortive candidacies for the United States Senate and for governor of California. He considered running for president in 2016 before ultimately endorsing Hillary Clinton.In some respects, the Democratic primary landscape appeared inviting for a candidate like Mr. Steyer, with his sterling credentials as a Trump antagonist and a virtually bottomless well of money to spend on advertising. He has been one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most prolific donors over the last few elections, eclipsed in 2018 only by Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who is considering a presidential campaign of his own.Anticipating a likely race, Mr. Steyer had settled on a close adviser, Heather Hargreaves, to serve as his eventual campaign manager. He had conducted research into his own political vulnerabilities, in anticipation of attacks from other Democrats in a rowdy primary, and had mapped out how to reorganize his advocacy groups to comply with the fund-raising regulations that apply to presidential candidates.Mr. Steyer also recently retained a new senior adviser, Doug Rubin, who previously advised former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts on a possible 2020 run. Mr. Patrick announced last month that he had closed the door on a presidential candidacy.Mr. Steyer and his advisers had conducted polling to test a campaign message focused on attacking corporate greed, confronting climate change \u2014 and, of course, denouncing Mr. Trump.Yet amid his preparations, there were warning signs for Mr. Steyer, too. As a candidate, he would have faced new levels of scrutiny of his business record: Mr. Steyer made his vast fortune as the founder of a hedge fund, and his portfolio of investments included considerable stakes in fossil fuel companies. As a wealthy white man, he could have been an awkward cultural match for a party increasingly defined by demands for racial and gender equality, and economic populism.And Mr. Steyer\u2019s intention to use his personal fortune in fueling a presidential campaign would most likely have been divisive in a Democratic primary. His announcement in Iowa that he would not run comes days after the first major Democratic candidate to join the race, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, denounced self-funding candidates on a swing through the leadoff caucus state.An adviser to Mr. Steyer, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations with him, said that he had been unruffled by Ms. Warren\u2019s attacks on billionaire candidates. But, the adviser said, Mr. Steyer was impressed by Ms. Warren\u2019s rollout as a candidate and suggested that her announcement video channeled the very themes he had been planning to campaign on.Mr. Steyer also disclosed to Vogue magazine in November that he and his wife of 32 years, Kat Taylor, were living separately.He is the second prominent Democrat to make preparations for a 2020 campaign before abandoning them, after Mr. Patrick.In stepping back from the presidential race, Mr. Steyer signaled he would further ramp up his impeachment drive, which has roiled Democratic politics over the last year, bringing him into direct conflict with elected party leaders and helping shove the idea of Mr. Trump\u2019s early removal into the mainstream of debate on the left.Underwritten by Mr. Steyer\u2019s personal wealth, the impeachment campaign has bombarded television and computer screens around the country with ads demanding Mr. Trump\u2019s ouster, and staged pro-impeachment events around the country.Mr. Steyer indicated on Wednesday that his pressure campaign would continue. One of his political committees, Need to Impeach, said it would aim a pressure campaign at House Democrats who lead committees relevant to impeachment, including Representatives Adam Schiff of California, who heads the House Intelligence Committee, and Jerrold Nadler of New York, who leads the House Judiciary Committee.And Mr. Steyer, a longtime donor to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, called on her by name to \u201cselect a bipartisan group of lawmakers to start immediately\u201d with a process to remove Mr. Trump from office.\u201cThe longer they wait, the more they normalize Mr. Trump\u2019s unacceptable acts,\u201d Mr. Steyer said in his prepared speech. \u201cAnd the more they enable him.\u201dDemocratic leaders remain wary of Mr. Steyer\u2019s impeachment message, and the institutional obstacles to removing Mr. Trump from office still appear insurmountable. Ejecting a president requires a two-thirds majority in the Senate, and Republicans hold 53 seats in the chamber.Yet the idea of impeachment has moved steadily into the foreground of the Democratic imagination, despite the obvious practical impediments. When a high-profile freshman lawmaker, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, vowed last week in coarse language to impeach Mr. Trump, she drew little censure from party leaders and numerous influential voices on the left leapt to her defense."}, {"title": "John Lasseter, Ousted From Pixar in #MeToo Wave, Finds New Hollywood Home", "category": "Business", "id": "1860ec77-2bf6-4004-bc17-a2b9810b0f89", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/business/media/john-lasseter-skydance.html", "publishdate": 20190109, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/10/business/10lasseter3/merlin_130393995_8577a95b-d249-4348-90c8-44f4f7c0665d-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 John Lasseter, the Pixar co-founder who was forced to resign from the Walt Disney Company in June after complaints about unwanted touching in the workplace, has become one of the first men toppled in the #MeToo era to find a new Hollywood perch.David Ellison, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d producer and founder of Skydance Media, a production company affiliated with Paramount Pictures, said on Wednesday that Mr. Lasseter would become Skydance\u2019s animation chief. Mr. Lasseter, 61, will start this month at the company, which Mr. Ellison, 36, started in 2010 with money inherited from his father, the Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison.The comedian Louis C.K. has pushed to revive his comedy career \u2014 to vigorous opposition \u2014 after admitting to sexual misconduct. But Mr. Lasseter, a force behind the \u201cToy Story,\u201d \u201cCars\u201d and \u201cFrozen\u201d franchises, is one of the first executives in the entertainment industry to return to a position of prominence after #MeToo allegations.In giving Mr. Lasseter a comeback opportunity, Mr. Ellison appears to have weighed his own professional ambitions \u2014 to build a major entertainment company \u2014 against any potential blowback, including from employees and advocacy organizations like Time\u2019s Up.\u201cJohn is a singular creative and executive talent whose impact on the animation industry cannot be overstated,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement. Skydance wants \u201cto expand our animation efforts for the global marketplace,\u201d he added. \u201cWe look forward to John bringing all of his creative talents, his experience managing large franchises, his renewed understanding of the responsibilities of leadership and his exuberance to Skydance.\u201dStill, Mr. Ellison continued: \u201cWe did not enter into this decision lightly. John has acknowledged and apologized for his mistakes and, during the past year away from the workplace, has endeavored to address and reform them.\u201dMr. Ellison did not specify how. A Skydance spokesman noted that the company\u2019s two most senior-ranking women, Dana Goldberg, chief creative officer, and Anne Globe, chief marketing officer, both supported the decision to bring aboard Mr. Lasseter.In an email to Skydance employees, Mr. Ellison said he had hired \u201coutside counsel to thoroughly investigate the allegations, which we considered serious.\u201d He did not reveal any of the conclusions but said the company had \u201ccarefully evaluated the findings of this extensive investigation.\u201dIn a statement of his own, Mr. Lasseter insisted that he had spent time in \u201cdeep reflection, learning how my actions unintentionally made many colleagues uncomfortable, which I deeply regret and apologize for.\u201d He added that he planned to build Skydance Animation in the same way he built Pixar, albeit with a new commitment to \u201csafety, trust and mutual respect.\u201dHe will replace Bill Damaschke, a former DreamWorks Animation executive.Time\u2019s Up, the organization founded by women in Hollywood  in response to the #MeToo movement, criticized Skydance as \u201cproviding another position of power, prominence and privilege to a man who has repeatedly been accused of sexual harassment in the workplace.\u201d The hire, Time\u2019s Up added in a statement, \u201cendorses and perpetuates a broken system that allows powerful men to act without consequence.\u201dTime\u2019s Up, whose founders include Reese Witherspoon and Shonda Rhimes, said three things were needed for men like Mr. Lasseter to return to positions of authority: a demonstration of true remorse, deep work to reform their behavior and restitution to those harmed.\u201cOffering a high-profile position to an abuser who has yet to do any of those things is condoning abuse,\u201d the organization said.The accusations against Mr. Lasseter did not rise to the level of those against powerful Hollywood figures like Harvey Weinstein, who has been accused of acts of sexual misconduct and rape going back decades, or Leslie Moonves, the former CBS chief who was found to have engaged in \u201cmultiple acts of serious nonconsensual sexual misconduct,\u201d according to a report by CBS investigators. Both Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Moonves have denied engaging in nonconsensual sexual activity.But the complaints made by Pixar and Disney employees against Mr. Lasseter were serious enough to prompt his ouster. The Hollywood Reporter cited \u201cgrabbing, kissing and making comments about physical attributes\u201d as recurring behavior by Mr. Lasseter in meetings and at work events, particularly when he had consumed alcohol. Multiple staff members \u2014 none who came forward publicly \u2014 also told managers at Disney that Mr. Lasseter had become increasingly domineering over the years.As word spread in Hollywood this week that Mr. Lasseter was close to finding new employment, several influential women involved with the #MeToo movement noted that he expressed no regret for his behavior or discussed making efforts to reform when he left Disney in June. In a statement at the time, he said he had made his own decision to \u201cbegin focusing on new creative challenges.\u201dDisney had put Mr. Lasseter on leave in November 2017. At that time, he sent an email to employees at Pixar and the separate Walt Disney Animation studio apologizing \u201cto anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape or form.\u201dAs Mr. Lasseter looked for a new job in recent months, people in his camp contended that he had been unfairly swept up in the #MeToo movement. At one point, he talked to Warner Bros. about a role there.Skydance, based in Santa Monica, has divisions dedicated to movies, television and video games. Skydance\u2019s recent films include \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout,\u201d which collected $791 million at the box office last year. It controls the \u201cTerminator\u201d franchise and supplies the hit series \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d to Netflix. Coming up, Mr. Ellison is working with Paramount Pictures on a \u201cTop Gun\u201d sequel and \u201cGemini Man,\u201d a science-fiction thriller directed by Ang Lee.Skydance releases most of its movies through Paramount Pictures, which counts on Mr. Ellison as a major producing and co-financing partner (and was told about Mr. Lasseter\u2019s hiring only in the minutes before it was announced). Skydance raised $700 million in new financing in 2016.Skydance Animation, founded in 2017, has not released any films. One of its first movies, \u201cLuck,\u201d directed by Alessandro Carloni (\u201cKung Fu Panda 3\u201d) and aimed toward theatrical release by Paramount in 2021, explores a world where secret organizations called Good Luck and Bad Luck secretly control people\u2019s lives. Another project is an untitled fantasy directed by Vicky Jenson (\u201cShrek\u201d). The division also intends to make animated television shows."}, {"title": "South Korea Raised Taxes in Bid for Growth.

Vice Premier Liu He, China\u2019s economic czar, is expected to go to Washington sometime after that.In a statement after the talks ended, the United States trade representative\u2019s office said the two sides had discussed China\u2019s pledge to buy a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of American agricultural, energy and manufacturing products.Negotiators also focused on White House concerns about China\u2019s approach to intellectual property protection and its practice of so-called forced technology transfer, the statement said.The Trump administration wants to ensure that China keeps its commitments in any deal that is reached. To that end, the statement said, officials discussed \u201cthe need for any agreement to provide for complete implementation subject to ongoing verification and effective enforcement.\u201dChina\u2019s Commerce Ministry said in a statement on Thursday morning on its official mini-blogging account that the two sides had \u201cconducted extensive, in-depth and meticulous exchanges on trade issues and structural issues of common concern, which enhanced mutual understanding and laid the foundation for resolving mutual concerns.\u201cBoth parties agreed to continue to maintain close contact,\u201d the statement continued, without specifying when or where the next meeting might be held.The United States delegation plans to report back to the White House to determine what happens next. The administration has set a March 2 deadline for raising tariffs on roughly two-fifths of annual American imports from China if no deal is reached.\u201cI\u2019m optimistic that they\u2019re making progress \u2014 the tone of the talks is important, and this tone has been good,\u201d said Dean Pinkert, a former commissioner of the United States International Trade Commission who is now a trade law partner at Hughes Hubbard & Reed, a big international law firm. \u201cIt is still important to the U.S. government to get credible commitments.\u201dAt issue is the extent to which China is willing to offer binding commitments to change trade practices that have long irked President Trump and his administration.The scheduled two-day talks extended into a third day as American officials pressed China for more details on how it will live up to its commitments, said people with knowledge of the negotiations, who insisted on anonymity to avoid disrupting the talks.China has made a series of offers to the Trump administration in recent weeks to end the trade war. But many of the administration\u2019s trade hawks regard them as nebulous, especially when it comes to Chinese trade practices that administration officials consider unfair.ImageThe Ministry of Commerce in Beijing.CreditOliver Zhang/Associated PressThey allege that officials in China pressure foreign companies to transfer key technologies to Chinese rivals as a condition for entering the country\u2019s market. They also protest lavish government subsidies granted through the Made in China 2025 program to build local companies into global powerhouses in industries like commercial aircraft, semiconductors and electric cars.China denies that its trade practices have been unfair. Nevertheless, officials have agreed to make it easier for multinational corporations to participate in manufacturing development programs in China. They have also promised to improve intellectual property protection and to ban the forced transfer of technology.Both sides see reasons to reach a deal soon. Mr. Trump wants to stabilize volatile financial markets, people familiar with the administration\u2019s deliberations said. President Xi Jinping of China is trying to confront weak business and consumer confidence, which have already triggered a sharp economic slowdown in his country.Adding to the difficulty of reaching a deal has been the fractious nature of the Trump administration, with the three main government departments involved in the negotiations each pursuing a somewhat different agenda. Those different agendas to some extent reflect each agency\u2019s institutional biases and responsibilities, but make it harder to predict what a final deal will look like.Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative and a hawk on trade issues, has led the push to impose tariffs on imports from China and has pursued an ambitious agenda that would require China to carry out verifiable and enforceable changes to the basic structure of its economy. Mr. Trump said last month that Mr. Lighthizer would be the lead trade negotiator with China.The Commerce Department, which oversees American export promotion activities overseas, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have been pushing since the early days of the administration for a deal that would require China to buy more food, natural gas and other products from the United States. Beijing officials have been happy to go along, as their country is short on arable land and gas, and long-term purchase agreements fit easily into the Chinese government\u2019s economic planning model.The Treasury Department, under Secretary Steven Mnuchin, has been pushing for a quick deal that would stop further increases in American tariffs. But Treasury would preserve indefinitely the 25 percent tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed in July and August on $50 billion a year in Chinese-made goods, or roughly a tenth of American imports, and the 10 percent tariffs that he imposed in September on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods.That first set of tariffs covers several categories in which China does not export much now but plans to do so in the next several years. The most important products covered by the 25 percent tariffs are gasoline-powered and electric cars. At least six Chinese automakers have announced plans to start exporting cars to the United States in 2020, said Michael Dunne, the chief executive of ZoZo Go, an automotive consulting firm specializing in China.\u201cImport duties will slow \u2014 but not stop \u2014 Chinese automakers\u2019 plans to enter the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a slowing home market, pressure to export has never been greater.\u201dDemocrats and Republicans alike have been wary of allowing an influx of Chinese cars in an election year, particularly when manufacturing states like Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin have been among the main electoral battlegrounds in recent decades.In the latest sign that the Chinese economy could use a lift from a trade agreement, officials announced Wednesday evening that car sales plummeted 19 percent last month from a year earlier, the steepest such decline in modern record-keeping in China.Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi agreed in Buenos Aires on Dec. 1 to a temporary truce that would keep last summer\u2019s American tariffs in place and suspend much of China\u2019s retaliation for those tariffs, but had few other details. So the quickest possible deal in the coming weeks could be to make that arrangement more permanent.Complicating the trade talks has been Mr. Xi\u2019s decision to invite North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, to visit Beijing this week. Mr. Trump has been pushing North Korea to abandon the development of missiles with nuclear warheads that can reach the United States, but he needs China\u2019s cooperation to do so because China is North Korea\u2019s main ally and largest trading partner.Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, reported that Mr. Kim left Beijing early Wednesday afternoon, about the same time that the trade talks ended.

Li Yuan, a technology columnist in Hong Kong, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.You write about Chinese tech. What tech tools do you rely on to do your job, and what do you like about them?It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say I live in and work on WeChat, the messaging app that\u2019s the equivalent of WhatsApp plus Facebook plus PayPal plus Uber plus GrubHub plus many other things. As my iPhone battery use record shows, I spend about one-third of my daily nine-hour phone time on WeChat. That doesn\u2019t include the two to three hours I use WeChat\u2019s web version.I\u2019m not alone in my heavy WeChat use. There are 800 million internet users in China, but over one billion WeChat accounts. Just about every Chinese online has at least one account, and some more than one. Over one-third of them spend four hours or more on the app each day. The prevalence has made WeChat an indispensable part of many people\u2019s lives and work. Two years ago, I met two people who refused to use WeChat, and I thought about writing a story about how people like them navigated work and life. Before I got around to it, both became my WeChat friends.So as a journalist, I have to hang out on WeChat. I message and call my sources on WeChat. I keep an eye on WeChat Moment, which is similar to Facebook Timeline, and group chats so I\u2019ll always be on top of what\u2019s going on in China. When others pretend they are too busy to get back to me, I comment on their Moment posts and group chats to tell them that I know they aren\u2019t so busy.By now, some readers must be screaming, \u201cHow about the censorship and government surveillance on WeChat?\u201d Sadly, it\u2019s just the way of life in China. I\u2019m not trying to make light of the issue. I\u2019ve been very critical of how the tech companies work with the government to censor and monitor the Chinese public. But the reality is that ordinary Chinese often feel powerless and fatalistic when it comes to censorship and surveillance. ImageWith government interference a fact of life in China, Ms. Yuan said, she has tried to persuade others to use encrypted messaging apps, but without much success.CreditKenneth Tsang for The New York TimesI\u2019ve tried to persuade people to get on encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp but haven\u2019t had much success. I also use Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. I used to be an active Weibo user and still have a few million followers there. But after the government cracked down on Weibo a few years ago and shut down many of the most provocative and influential accounts, I don\u2019t use it too often because the conversations are often dominated by celebrity news instead of discussions of current affairs. But Weibo is still a good place to check out the hottest topics and trends. That\u2019s where I found people to talk to for a column I wrote about the generation that grew up without Google, Facebook or Twitter.How do people in China use tech differently, compared with people in the United States?The first thing many visitors to China notice is how mobile the Chinese are. Many Chinese never owned a laptop or a PC, and their first computer was their smartphone. Email never really took off in China. Some big corporations do use it. But people usually resort to WeChat for a quick response.Because of WeChat\u2019s prevalence, few Chinese carry business cards any more. At many meetings in China, there\u2019s a time when everybody takes out his or her phone and scans the WeChat QR codes of others to become \u201cfriends.\u201d I personally like having contacts on WeChat rather than on business cards. Because it\u2019s a social media platform, you learn about your contacts as individuals beyond their business titles.Many businesspeople I know have two or more WeChat accounts because WeChat allows only 5,000 contacts for one account. A young venture capitalist told me that it had taken him only two years to reach the limit. I don\u2019t know how they manage so many contacts.Generally, Chinese are more receptive to new things and more tolerant of imperfect products, including mobile apps. Some commentators here say Facebook is almost a Chinese company because of its \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d mantra. Many people in China\u2019s internet industry work super-long hours to make sure they beat competitors to roll out new features first.Why are mobile wallets so popular in China?When I moved from New York to Beijing in 2008, China was still a cash-based nation. Not many people had credit cards, and it wasn\u2019t easy for small businesses to get approval to install the machines. I used to have to go to the A.T.M.s all the time. Going to the banks, mostly giant state-owned enterprises, was torturously time-consuming. Then came WeChat Pay and Alipay, the mobile payment services from Tencent and Alibaba. Since so many Chinese were already on WeChat and were trained to scan QR codes, it took the two giants only some cash-bonus campaigns at grocery stores to convert people like my mom to mobile payments.ImageMobile payment systems are widely available in China. CreditKenneth Tsang for The New York TimesMobile pay is now available in almost every place I visit in China, including small towns. I\u2019ve been carrying a 100-yuan ($15) bill in my wallet for months but haven\u2019t found an occasion to use it. Everybody \u2014 hotels, department stores, taxi drivers, noodle stands \u2014 takes Alipay or WeChat Pay or both. Even tollbooths accept mobile payment. What are some hot new apps, tech products or internet services in China?The hottest app is a short video service, Douyin, which is called TikTok outside China. As my colleague Kevin Roose aptly put it in a recent column, it\u2019s \u201ca quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment \u2018Carpool Karaoke.\u2019\u201dTo be honest, I\u2019m too old for the app \u2014 Douyin targets urban teenagers and 20-somethings \u2014 and have not spent much time on it. But I\u2019ve seen some viral Douyin videos on Weibo and WeChat that are fun and goofy. Some young Chinese told me that they spend hours watching Douyin videos every day, which I would argue is the downside of the app. Its parent company, Bytedance, is very good at using artificial intelligence to push content based on users\u2019 viewing history.The short video app that I check out from time to time is Douyin\u2019s rival, Kwai. Kwai is popular in small towns and the countryside. You can watch young people chasing geese and getting married in white gowns in front of mud houses. I call Kwai the \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d of China. It\u2019s where you can get a flavor of what China is like outside the biggest coastal cities.Outside of work, what tech product are you into right now? I\u2019m a very low-tech person! While my iPhone feels like an extension of my left arm, I don\u2019t use many other electronics. I didn\u2019t own a TV until a year ago and only watch Netflix sometimes. I bought a microwave this year, and it\u2019s the simplest model because I knew I would use it only to reheat food.My biggest tech wish is for Google, Facebook, Apple or another company to build a technology that can break the Great Firewall, the system of filters and blocks that prevents Chinese from visiting thousands of foreign websites. Instead of kowtowing to the Chinese government\u2019s demands in order to gain access to the market, American tech giants could do something heroic: Liberate hundreds of millions of people from information darkness."}, {"title": "Fed Ready to Pause on Interest Rate Increases", "category": "Business", "id": "97062bf1-da07-42fb-943d-95ac1833041b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/business/economy/fed-interest-rates-minutes.html", "publishdate": 20190109, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/10/business/10DC-FED/merlin_148329129_3bade939-f7fc-4961-86be-fba5de2a4c86-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A pair of influential Federal Reserve officials said Wednesday that the central bank should pause to assess economic conditions before considering additional interest rate increases, reinforcing the message delivered last week by the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell.The Fed on Wednesday also published an account of its most recent meeting, in December, which showed that most Fed officials had already reached a similar conclusion at that time.Taken together, the speeches and the meeting minutes signal that the Fed will not raise its benchmark interest rate at its January meeting and that it is unlikely to do so at the following meeting, in mid-March.But most Fed officials still expect that economic growth will be strong enough to justify rate increases later in the year.Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, told a Boston audience that the Fed was puzzling through the recent divergence between strong economic data and faltering financial markets.\u201cAt this juncture, with two very different scenarios \u2014 economic slowdown implied by financial markets; or growth somewhat above potential G.D.P. growth, consistent with economic forecasts \u2014 I believe we can wait for greater clarity before adjusting policy,\u201d he said.Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, delivered a similar message in a speech Wednesday in Riverwoods, Ill. \u201cI feel we have good capacity to wait and carefully take stock of the incoming data and other developments,\u201d he said.The remarks were significant because both men spoke in favor of the Fed\u2019s rate increases last year, and both hold rotating votes on the Fed\u2019s policy committee.James Bullard, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who opposed the rate increases last year, told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that he, too, favored a pause.The Fed is \u201cbordering on going too far and possibly tipping the economy into recession,\u201d Mr. Bullard said. He added that other Fed officials were coming around to his position that the Fed should pause.The Fed at its December meeting raised its benchmark rate into a range between 2.25 and 2.5 percent. It was the fifth consecutive quarterly increase. Mr. Powell said the rate now stood near the lower end of the range that the Fed regards as neutral territory \u2014 neither encouraging nor discouraging borrowing and economic growth.At a news conference after the December meeting, Mr. Powell emphasized that economic growth remained strong, and that the Fed expected to continue raising rates in 2019. Investors registered their disapproval by driving down asset prices, exacerbating a market slump.Since then, Mr. Powell and other Fed officials have sought to deliver a more nuanced message, emphasizing that they are paying attention to investors\u2019 concerns, and that the absence of inflationary pressure means the Fed can afford to postpone judgment.The account of the December meeting reinforced that message.The Fed, according to the minutes, said that \u201cparticipants expressed that recent developments, including the volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth, made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming less clear than earlier.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s own economic outlook remains upbeat. The minutes described economic data in the final months of 2018 as even stronger than the Fed had expected. Mr. Rosengren said consumers remained \u201cwilling to spend,\u201d and he expected unemployment would continue to fall.Mr. Evans said he was still forecasting \u201canother good year in 2019.\u201dBut uncertainties have piled up in recent months. The minutes said investors were particularly concerned about trade tensions between the United States and China, and about global growth.The minutes did not mention that investors also fear that the Fed will make a mistake by raising interest rates too quickly, snuffing out the economic expansion.The recent downturn in financial markets is both a symptom of these worries and a potential problem in its own right. Declines in invested wealth, or reductions in lending, can infect the broader economy.The message from Fed officials is that the Fed will wait to see who is correct.\u201cIf the pessimism evident in financial markets eventually shows through to economic outcomes, there would be less need (and perhaps no need) for further increases in interest rates,\u201d Mr. Rosengren said. \u201cHowever, my current expectation is that the more optimistic view will prevail.\u201dTo reinforce that policy decisions will depend on the latest economic data, the minutes said that the officials discussed changes in the Fed\u2019s communications. Since the 2008 crisis, the Fed has leaned heavily on \u201cforward guidance\u201d to manage market expectations about its plans. In recent months, it has sought to reduce that guidance, encouraging investors to focus instead on the latest economic data.At the December meeting, Fed officials also continued to discuss the Fed\u2019s gradual reduction of its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which were acquired during and after the financial crisis as part of the central bank\u2019s campaign to stimulate economic growth.The Fed, which is reducing the holdings at a regular pace, has said that it does not want to adjust that pace in response to changes in economic conditions, preferring to adjust interest rates instead. But the minutes said that Fed officials discussed the possibility of adjusting the pace for technical reasons, as part of the process of determining how large a portfolio the Fed should maintain in the longer term."}, {"title": "40 Million Watched Trump\u2019s Prime-Time Address on TV", "category": "Business", "id": "56c334f8-765b-4ca1-8971-84fe1fe2e62f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/business/media/president-trump-speech-ratings.html", "publishdate": 20190109, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/10/business/10RATINGS-01/10RATINGS-01-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Even in its heyday, \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d never earned ratings like this.President Trump\u2019s appearance in network prime time on Tuesday \u2014 a nine-minute speech from the Oval Office on border security that mostly recycled his usual talking points \u2014 drew roughly 40 million television viewers, according to statistics released on Wednesday by Nielsen.That audience fell short of Mr. Trump\u2019s State of the Union address last January, which drew about 45.6 million viewers, and past landmark presidential moments, like Barack Obama\u2019s announcement of the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011, which reached 56.5 million people.But Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance edged Mr. Obama\u2019s 2016 State of the Union address (31.3 million), a 2014 speech that Mr. Obama delivered about the Islamic State (34.1 million) and, for good measure, the first-season finale of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in 2004 (28 million).The decision by broadcast networks to pre-empt programming for Mr. Trump, who requested time to discuss the government shutdown, touched off a vigorous debate.The speech itself made little news, and critics questioned why network executives had agreed to grant Mr. Trump such a large platform. Executives said they believed that the shutdown, and its adverse affects on millions of Americans, were inherently newsworthy.Mr. Trump told a group of news anchors at a private lunch on Tuesday that he hadn\u2019t been inclined to give the address and that his public-relations blitz on border security was \u201cnot going to change a damn thing.\u201dViewers still tuned in, including nearly 16 million across the three big cable news channels \u2014 Fox News, CNN and MSNBC \u2014 a major jump in their usual weeknight audience.

China has also offered to welcome more foreign investors and help limit forced transfer of overseas companies\u2019 technology to Chinese businesses.Yesterday, President Trump wrote on Twitter that the discussions were \u201cgoing very well!\u201dBut in Washington, many are sounding a note of caution: Are China\u2019s promises too vague? Are they enforceable? One scholar described Beijing\u2019s compromises as \u201ca modest adjustment\u201d when the U.S. and other countries want a \u201cgreat leap in liberalization.\u201dThe Kim surprise:  Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, stepped off a train in Beijing yesterday to meet with President Xi Jinping, at the Chinese government\u2019s invitation. China said the timing of his arrival was coincidental, but his presence was a reminder that the U.S. needs China\u2019s cooperation to exert pressure on North Korea.Scheduling issues: The Trump administration has said that if negotiations fail, it will raise tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. But there are several other key dates in play.\u2022 Mr. Trump will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts Jan. 22. But the U.S. is reluctant to set up formal trade negotiations there, possibly because the president plans to use his State of the Union address, on Jan. 29, to demand broader powers to raise tariffs.\u2022 But China wants progress before the Lunar New Year on Feb. 4, which is generally preceded by a surge in consumer spending.China has reason to rush: The trade tensions are hurting its economy.\u2022 The World Bank said yesterday that Chinese growth would slow to 6.2 percent this year from 6.5 percent last year. Global growth is predicted to fall to 2.9 percent from 3 percent in 2018.\u2022 Corporate insolvencies are expected to increase faster in China than in any other major economy this year, growing by a fifth in 2019.\u2022 Chinese bond yields are at a two-year low. Its central bank loosened credit conditions five times in the past year.\u2022 Signs of progress in the talks drove markets higher in the U.S. yesterday and in Europe and Asia today.A reprieve for SearsThe struggling retailer reached a deal yesterday to stay alive after a flurry of last-minute negotiations, the NYT\u2019s Michael Corkery writes. Sears\u2019s chairman, Edward Lampert, a hedge fund manager who took control in 2005, now has the opportunity to sweeten his $4.4 billion bid for the company. He is expected to enter an official bid at a court-supervised auction next week.Sears\u2019 largest creditors are in the driving seat, and they have two options. They can let Mr. Lampert try to maintain it as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d or force it to liquidate by selling all its real estate, inventory, intellectual property and other assets.Other retail news: In the first retail holiday update, J.C. Penney reported yesterday that adjusted comparable sales fell 3.5 percent during the crucial shopping period.

It was ostensibly focused on her right to his holdings, but it drew interest because of the salacious details it disclosed and the questions it raised about his mental state.Mr. Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone, run the private theater chain National Amusements, through which they control the CBS television network and a portfolio of companies at Viacom that include MTV and Paramount Pictures.Ms. Herzer, who is at least four decades younger than Mr. Redstone, had been named as a beneficiary of his will until he stripped her from the document in 2015 and forced her out of his mansion in Beverly Hills.Fallout from the ensuing court battle led Mr. Redstone to scale back his involvement in CBS and Viacom, and prompted a succession struggle that put his daughter at the top of the media empire.Court filings show that Ms. Herzer must now pay back $3.25 million in gifts and money received while she was Mr. Redstone\u2019s companion.Dark days for Deutsche BankInvestment bankers at the embattled financial institution are steeling themselves for a double-digit cut to their bonus pool, according to the FT.Deutsche has been battered by bad news in the past year: Its stock price hit record lows, competitors are gobbling up its market share, and top-level employees are jumping ship as it fires thousands of others.

Spurred by substantiated allegations of harassment against one of the most prominent young economists in the country, top women in the field shared stories of their own struggles with discrimination. Graduate students and junior professors demanded immediate steps by the A.E.A. to help victims of harassment and discipline economists who violate the group\u2019s newly adopted code of conduct.Leading male economists offered an unprecedented acknowledgment of harassment and discrimination in the field. \u201cEconomics certainly has a problem,\u201d Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who took over as A.E.A. president this year, said during a panel discussion. The profession has, \u201cunfortunately, a reputation for hostility toward women and minorities,\u201d he said.Janet L. Yellen, who was the first chairwoman of the Fed and will head the A.E.A. next year, said that addressing the issue \u201cshould be the highest priority\u201d for economists in the years to come.During a panel discussion on gender issues, Ms. Yellen was one of several women who shared stories of discrimination and bullying. Her fellow panelists described a list of \u201cknown\u201d male predators in academic departments who have never been punished for behavior that included repeatedly making unwanted sexual advances toward junior colleagues.One of the panelists, Susan Athey, a Stanford economist, said she had bought \u201ckhakis and loafers\u201d to fit in with the men in the lunchroom of her first economics department, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She did so even though the department was the \u201cmost supportive environment\u201d she has encountered in her career.\u201cI spent all my time hoping that no one would remember I was female,\u201d said Ms. Athey, a past winner of a prestigious award for young economists. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to remind people that I\u2019m a sexual being.\u201dEconomics has long struggled with diversity. Only about a third of economics doctorates go to women, and the gender gap is wider at senior levels of the profession. Racial and ethnic minorities \u2014 particularly African-Americans and Latinos \u2014 are even more underrepresented. And notably, the gender gap in economics is wider than in other social sciences and, at least by some measures, traditionally male-dominated fields such as science and math.Certain subfields, like finance, have a particularly poor record of advancing women. A branch of the American Finance Association presented survey results in Atlanta that show barely 10 percent of tenured finance professors, and 16 percent of tenure-track faculty, are women. In economics as a whole, women accounted for about 23 percent of tenured and tenure-track faculty in 2015.Stories of harassment and discrimination, long shared in private conversations and email chains, began to be aired more publicly last year with allegations that Roland G. Fryer, a prominent Harvard economist, had harassed and bullied women in his university-affiliated research lab. The New York Times reported last month that a Harvard investigation had substantiated some of those claims while other investigations are continuing.The economics association last year approved its first code of professional conduct, which calls for \u201cequal opportunity and fair treatment for all economists\u201d regardless of sex, race or other characteristics. The association also created a standing committee to address diversity, and is surveying its members about harassment and discrimination.But many economists, particularly younger ones, pushed leaders here for more aggressive action. Hundreds of graduate students and research assistants have signed an open letter calling for more explicit codes of conduct, stronger enforcement and better systems for reporting abuses, among other reforms.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to rely on whisper networks to protect us from abuse and inappropriate behavior,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have the power to discipline our supervisors, or even our peers. You do. Please, listen to us.\u201dSome of that frustration bubbled over in the A.E.A.\u2019s formal business meeting Friday evening, a usually dry affair in which members hear reports on the association\u2019s finances and similar matters.ImageLisa Cook, Associate Professor of Economics and Director of the AEA Summer Program at Michigan State University.CreditBrittany Greeson for The New York Times\u201cThere\u2019s just a ton of anger and resentment around how the profession has been,\u201d Elisabeth Perlman, 34, an economist with the Census Bureau, said at the meeting. She added that the profession must also address the misconduct that was allowed to go unchecked for decades.Meeting attendees also expressed frustration with what they said was the association\u2019s response to the allegations against Mr. Fryer, who had been due to join the A.E.A.\u2019s executive committee this month. After the Times article was published, the association issued a two-sentence announcement that Mr. Fryer had resigned, but made no other public statement.\u201cThe silence from the executive committee has really been deafening,\u201d Jennifer Doleac, a professor at Texas A&M, said at Friday\u2019s business meeting. \u201cA lot of the profession is really waiting to hear from you, and for some semblance of leadership about the direction of the profession and what will be tolerated and what won\u2019t be.\u201dOlivier Blanchard, the association\u2019s departing president, said for the first time Friday that the executive committee had asked Mr. Fryer to resign. He called that request \u201cthe best way out\u201d because the association had no formal procedure to remove an elected officer. The committee, Mr. Blanchard said, is now working to develop such rules.Some members of the executive committee wanted to go further and establish procedures to punish or expel members for violations of the code of conduct. There are currently no such penalties.Other members seemed more skeptical of that idea when it was raised in a closed-door session last Thursday, according to several people who were there. Mr. Blanchard cut off discussion, saying he was hungry and it was time for lunch, these people said. The committee will take up the issue again in April.Mr. Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, did not dispute that account. \u201cThe job of the person in charge of the meeting is to make sure that all issues on the agenda are taken up and discussed,\u201d he wrote in an email on Wednesday, adding a parenthetical: \u201cand yes, that people, including me, have time to eat.\u201dHe also said that he was \u201chappy\u201d that the profession was taking women\u2019s concerns seriously, and that \u201cI think the A.E.A. is playing a strong role\u201d on the issue.Lisa D. Cook, a Michigan State University economist who is one of the most prominent black women in the field, credited younger women with forcing the A.E.A. to move more quickly.\u201cI told them they have more power than they know,\u201d Ms. Cook said of graduate students and other young people pushing for change. \u201cThis is the possible beginnings of a sea change.\u201dMany male economists long dismissed claims of bias and discrimination, arguing that gender disparities must reflect differences in preference or ability. They pointed to theories that predict that, in the simplified world of economic models, discrimination on the basis of characteristics like gender and race would disappear because of competition.In recent years, however, a growing body of research has found evidence of discrimination at virtually every stage of the profession, from undergraduate enrollment to tenure decisions. Erin Hengel, a University of Liverpool economist, has found that women are held to higher standards of writing and research than their male colleagues. Alice Wu, then an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, made waves two years ago with a paper documenting rampant misogyny and hostility toward women on a popular online forum for graduate students.One provocatively titled paper presented in Atlanta asked \u201cDoes Economics Make You Sexist?\u201d It found that undergraduate students in Chile exhibited more implicit and explicit gender bias after studying economics. The effect was particularly strong among male students \u2014 and weaker in departments with more female faculty members.Shelly Lundberg, a University of California, Santa Barbara, economist who has long pushed the field to include more women, said that each study had faced \u201can unusual level of scrutiny and skepticism,\u201d but that taken together, they were hard to dismiss.\u201cThe realization that this is real, that there is bias, is starting to sink in,\u201d Ms. Lundberg said. \u201cI really think this may have been the breakthrough.\u201d"}, {"title": "Everything You Thought You Knew About Driving on Snow Was Wrong", "category": "Business", "id": "dd02efbc-30a0-4315-b451-95794079e635", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/business/driving-snow-ice-winter.html", "publishdate": 20190110, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/11/business/11WHEELS-WINTER/11WHEELS-WINTER-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Ogden Nash described winter as \u201cthe season to be young, catching snowflakes on your tongue.\u201d Sure, snow days are fun for children, but for drivers, wintry weather is a hazard.The problem is that driver education classes typically gloss over what makes winter driving different and how to avoid and handle skids, said Tim O\u2019Neil, the founder of Team O\u2019Neil, a rally-driving school in Dalton, N.H., that also teaches winter driving.That\u2019s why even people who have been driving for decades can make crucial mistakes on snowy roads, said Mark Cox, the director of the Bridgestone Winter Driving School in Steamboat Springs, Colo.\u201cWe see a lot of people from all over the country who have grown up in the Snow Belt and have years and years of driving experience and in reality have just been lucky because their technique leaves a lot to be desired,\u201d Mr. Cox said.The biggest problem is speed, and not knowing it will take much longer to stop, experts say. Here\u2019s some other advice to avoid slip-sliding away.Some snow is more slipperyThe amount of grip available on snow can change sharply depending on the temperatures, said James H. Lever, a researcher at the Army\u2019s Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in Hanover, N.H.Warm snow is weaker and gives way more easily, so tires have a harder time getting a good grip, he said.\u201cAs temperatures warm up, it gets more slippery. It is a big effect,\u201d he said. For example, when the air is 30 degrees Fahrenheit, packed snow is about five times more slick than it is at zero degrees.Researchers say when a tire begins to slide across the snow at higher temperatures it is more likely to melt the snow. That water then acts as a lubricant.Smooth moves are importantOn dry pavement, tires have so much grip that drivers can accelerate hard, slam on the brakes and make sudden, sharp turns, Mr. O\u2019Neil said.But that all changes on a slippery surface.\u201cWe have less grip in the winter. One of the things you have to do in the winter is be way smoother,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neil said. Otherwise, the tires can quickly lose what little grip they have.On dry pavement it may be possible to brake while going through a turn. On snow it is safest to slow the vehicle first and then make the turn, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like walking on the ice. You take smaller, little tiny steps. You don\u2019t try to run on the ice. It\u2019s the same idea with a car,\u201d he said.Four-wheel drive isn\u2019t a cure-all\u201cA lot of people overestimate the capabilities of their vehicles, especially people driving all-wheel drive. They mash the gas pedal and the thing goes forward with all four wheels pulling and they get a false sense of confidence,\u201d Mr. Cox said.\u201cThe beauty of all-wheel drive is to help get you moving from a complete stop, that is where it is the best \u2014 or climbing a steep hill. But when it comes to braking and cornering, all-wheel drive doesn\u2019t give you much or any benefit. Often they are the first ones in the ditch.\u201dBe wary of all-season tiresAll-season tires are a compromise, just like a houseboat, said Travis Hanson, the director of operations at Team O\u2019Neil. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good house, and it\u2019s not a good boat,\u201d he said.For winter driving, the best winter tires are far superior to the best all-season tires, said Jennifer Stockburger, who conducts tire testing for Consumer Reports and is the director of operations at its auto test center.One reason is a special tread design with \u201cadditional biting edges\u201d called sipes, Ms. Stockburger said.In addition, winter tires have a special rubber compound that stays more pliable \u2014 and thus grippy \u2014 when the temperature drops, she said.One downside is that the softer compound doesn\u2019t last as long as the compound on an all-season tire. Another is that the cornering and braking on dry pavement may be diminished.\u201cThey are squirmier. The more pliable rubber. The additional cuts. There\u2019s no free lunch,\u201d she said.The Quebec government considers winter tires to be such an advantage that in 2008 it began requiring them on passenger vehicles between December and March.Those tires must have what\u2019s known as an \u201calpine\u201d symbol, an icon with a mountain and snowflake, on the sidewall indicating they meet international standards for winter performance. The law applies only to vehicles registered in Quebec.Ms. Stockburger said anyone who drives in snow should have winter tires on all four wheels. \u201cIt is absolutely worth the investment.\u201dThe electronic safety netMost vehicles now have anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control.Anti-lock brakes are designed to automatically pump the brakes and help the driver maintain control when trying to stop on a slippery surface.Electronic stability control uses sensors to determine if the front or rear of the vehicle is going in a direction that\u2019s at odds with where the steering wheel is aimed. Then, it applies one or more brakes to try to nudge the vehicle back in the right direction.But drivers shouldn\u2019t be using those regularly, Mr. Cox said.\u201cIf your stability control or your anti-lock brakes turns on, that means you as a driver have made a mistake and the electronic nanny has stepped in to try to save you from that,\u201d he said.Instead, he said, drivers should view those as sensors. If the driver feels the anti-lock brakes or electronic stability systems engage, it\u2019s a clear sign to slow down because the vehicle is approaching \u201cthe edge of available grip.\u201dAnd those systems work best with winter tires because they need traction to be most effective, Mr. O\u2019Neil said.What to do when it goes wrong\u201cWhen you do start losing control, you really need to look where you want to go rather than staring at whatever obstacle you might run into.\u201d Usually, Mr. Hanson said, your hands will steer you in that direction.And, hopefully, out of harm\u2019s way."}, {"title": "Judge Cites \u2018Serious\u2019 Accusations Against McKinsey in Reopening Bankruptcy Case", "category": "Business", "id": "74c8f651-5d92-4a60-90ac-3f8b1049d109", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/business/mckinsey-bankruptcy-investments.html", "publishdate": 20190110, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/10/business/10MCKINSEYprint/merlin_148958727_5a35c78c-b16a-4a56-aeb8-e07bf128473f-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 A judge in Virginia reopened a more than two-year-old case on Wednesday to consider accusations that the powerful consultancy McKinsey & Company had defrauded his court while advising a bankrupt coal company.\u201cThese are some of the most serious allegations that I have ever seen,\u201d said the judge, Kevin R. Huennekens of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Richmond.The decision to reopen the bankruptcy case of Alpha Natural Resources was the latest in a series of court actions and legislative maneuvers meant to examine whether McKinsey has failed to disclose investments in the entities it helps reorganize \u2014 an arrangement that could allow the company to profit off the plan it helped put in place. The request to reopen came from a retired turnaround specialist, Jay Alix, and was supported by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of the United States Trustee.The federal bankruptcy code bars the professionals who work on bankruptcies from hiding their stakes, although possessing an interest in a company is not automatically disqualifying. The regulations require the disclosure of such connections between companies to ensure fair treatment of all parties.McKinsey has denied wrongdoing. \u201cWe continue to stand by our disclosures, which have always fully complied with the law, and we are confident that Alix\u2019s fraud claims will be exposed as completely meritless,\u201d the company said in a statement.McKinsey already faces similar claims of misconduct from Mr. Alix in the bankruptcy of another energy company, Westmoreland Coal, in Texas. And an examination by The New York Times revealed how the company is acting as an adviser in the bankruptcy-like restructuring of Puerto Rico while also holding some of the territory\u2019s debt. A bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed legislation that would strengthen the disclosure requirements in Puerto Rico\u2019s case.Judge Huennekens did not indicate whether he thought there was any merit to the allegations involving Alpha Natural Resources, but said they were too grave to brush off.\u201cWe have to get to the bottom of this,\u201d he said.Mr. Alix, who formed a small investment company that bought some of Alpha\u2019s unsecured debt, has expressed concerns about McKinsey\u2019s behavior in bankruptcies for several years.Mr. Alix alleged that there was \u201csubstantial, irrefutable evidence\u201d that a McKinsey investment fund held an indirect stake in Alpha\u2019s secured debt. He told the court he believed McKinsey had improperly reaped a profit of $50 million because it helped determine the way secured creditors were compensated.McKinsey made the investment through an outside hedge fund, Whitebox Advisors, which has been a creditor in several other bankruptcies where McKinsey played a role, as well as in Puerto Rico\u2019s case.Judge Huennekens said he was especially troubled by Mr. Alix\u2019s accusation that McKinsey did not tell him about its relationship with Whitebox, because McKinsey disclosed its business connections to the judge privately, rather than in open court.A lawyer for McKinsey, Jennifer Selendy, told the judge the omission was not intentional. She said the consulting firm believed it had provided all the information that Judge Huennekens had asked for. She said Mr. Alix was seizing upon innocent omissions and using them to make \u201cwild accusations.\u201dJudge Huennekens said McKinsey\u2019s relationship with Whitebox still should have been disclosed, saying that it would have shone out at him \u201clike a beacon.\u201dThe Office of the United States Trustee had also asked for the Alpha case to be reopened. The office filed a statement in court in November, saying that McKinsey had failed to comply to make \u201ctransparent, timely and accurate\u201d disclosures of potential conflicts. The statement asked Judge Huennekens to order McKinsey to pay back roughly $20 million in fees it had received.The hearing Wednesday came a week after another bankruptcy judge, David R. Jones, told McKinsey and Mr. Alix that they should try to settle their dispute over Westmoreland Coal. If they didn\u2019t, he said, he would also be compelled to investigate further. The United States Trustee is also urging the court to disqualify McKinsey in that case and make it forfeit the fees it has earned."}, {"title": "Netherlands May Have Given Nike Illegal Tax Breaks, E.U.

Starbucks paid \u20ac25.7 million to the Netherlands in 2015, and an investigation into Ikea is underway.The Dutch Finance Ministry said Thursday that it was cooperating with the investigation. \u201cWe fully support the work of the commission,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.Nike said in its own statement that the investigation was \u201cwithout merit.\u201d\u201cNike is subject to and rigorously ensures that it complies with all the same tax laws as other companies operating in the Netherlands,\u201d the company, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., said in the statement.The Netherlands has long been a magnet for multinational corporations, attracting more foreign investment than Germany or France because of its business-friendly tax laws and its accommodating officials.Big companies have typically worked out arrangements with the Dutch Finance Ministry under which they minimized their tax bills by funneling profits to offshore tax havens with little or no corporate taxes. About \u20ac22 billion a year flows through the Netherlands to low-tax countries, according to the ministry, which did not provide an estimate of how much Nike might have saved.Airbus, Fiat Chrysler, Google, IBM and the Renault-Nissan alliance are among the corporations that have headquarters in the Netherlands. Nike\u2019s European headquarters are in Hilversum, just south of Amsterdam.The Netherlands has come under pressure from the European Commission and Dutch citizens disgruntled about special favors for big companies. Officials in Amsterdam have responded by vowing to tighten rules that allow companies to camouflage profits as \u201croyalties\u201d and protect them from taxes.Dutch officials have also said that they would no longer approve corporate structures that allowed companies to steer profits to low-tax countries and that royalties would be subject to taxation starting in 2021. The Netherlands is also moving to eliminate inconsistencies in international tax laws that corporations can exploit to avoid taxes.Nike\u2019s tax practices in the Netherlands have drawn scrutiny before. It used a common method of shifting profits to a tax haven, according to research published in 2017 by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists based on leaked documents known as the Paradise Papers. (The New York Times is a member of the consortium.)First, Nike allocated ownership of its \u201cswoosh\u201d trademark and other intellectual property to a subsidiary in Bermuda, which has no corporate income tax. The subsidiary in Hilversum then paid royalties for the use of the trademarks to the Bermuda unit. The royalties counted as business expenses and therefore were not taxed in the Netherlands.The company\u2019s strategies also lowered its tax bill in the United States and cut its worldwide tax rate to as low as 13 percent in 2017 from 35 percent in 2006, saving billions of dollars, according to the consortium.The European Commission is investigating whether the Dutch government violated European Union rules by approving the tax avoidance scheme and giving Nike and its Converse unit an unfair advantage over competitors.From 2005 to 2015, the commission said in a statement, the Dutch authorities endorsed Nike\u2019s method for calculating the tax-deductible royalties paid to offshore subsidiaries. The commission said it was examining whether the royalties paid to the offshore units, which had no employees, were higher than the market value of the intellectual property.By paying an inflated price for the royalties, Nike could claim a larger tax deduction."}, {"title": "Bernie Sanders Apologizes Again to Women Who Were Mistreated in 2016 Campaign", "category": "Politics", "id": "c9e40cdf-eaa1-48ea-b689-78371ee275b4", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/sanders-sexism-apology.html", "publishdate": 20190110, "imageurl": "", "content": "For a second time in eight days, Senator Bernie Sanders apologized to women on his 2016 presidential campaign, as he seeks to put behind him a series of damaging reports about the mistreatment of female staff members that threatens to undercut another likely White House bid.A political housecleaning appeared underway as well in the Sanders camp: Three top advisers from the 2016 campaign either will not return if Mr. Sanders runs in 2020 or will serve in different roles, according to people close to Mr. Sanders.One of those 2016 advisers, Rich Pelletier, who served as national field director and deputy campaign manager, was let go Thursday from the main volunteer effort trying to draft Mr. Sanders to run in 2020 after The Times reported on accounts that he mishandled concerns about allegations of mistreatment.Mr. Sanders\u2019s two apologies follow several recent articles describing harassment, sexism and gender discrimination in his 2016 campaign, including a report last week in The Times and another on Wednesday night in Politico. Several of his top aides and advisers have been implicated; Jeff Weaver, his campaign manager, has said he would not return in the same role if the Vermont senator runs again.\u201cIt appears that as part of our campaign, there were some women who were harassed and mistreated \u2014 I thank them from the bottom of my heart for speaking out,\u201d Mr. Sanders said during a scheduled news conference on Thursday about prescription drugs. \u201cWhat they experienced was absolutely unacceptable and certainly not what a progressive campaign or any campaign should be about.\u201d\u201cWhen we talk about \u2014 and I do all the time \u2014 ending sexism and all forms of discrimination, those beliefs cannot just be words. They must be based in day-to-day reality and the work we do, and that was clearly not the case in the 2016 campaign,\u201d he added.Some campaign alumni have requested a meeting with the senator and his campaign leadership team to discuss the treatment of women going forward, with some delegates suggesting he should not run again until he addresses the issue of sexism in his campaign.In a statement posted on Twitter shortly after Thursday\u2019s news conference, Mr. Sanders said: \u201cClearly we need a cultural revolution in this country to change workplace attitudes and behavior. I intend in every way to be actively involved in that process.\u201dThough Mr. Sanders has not yet announced he is running for president, allegations of harassment, sexism and gender discrimination that have emerged in recent weeks have already threatened to impede a potential 2020 bid.The 2016 runner-up is especially vulnerable on gender-related issues because so many of his top aides were men and some of his most outspoken supporters, derided as \u201cBernie Bros\u201d by supporters of Hillary Clinton, were often caustic and sexist in their criticism of the Democratic Party\u2019s eventual nominee.The issue is just as acute because of President Trump\u2019s widely criticized derogatory comments about women and the number of female candidates who could also join the 2020 race. Indeed, the reports about sexism in Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign have come as his friend and colleague, Senator Elizabeth Warren, has entered the race with the sort of assault on corporate interests and big money in politics that could appeal to Mr. Sanders\u2019s enthusiasts.In the Times article, former staff members described in on-the-record interviews their experiences with sexism, including harassment and pay inequity. They portrayed the insurgent 2016 campaign as disorganized and decentralized, making it hard to report mistreatment.In an interview on CNN last week following the Times report, Mr. Sanders said he was proud of his 2016 campaign and attributed any missteps with staff members to the explosive growth that was sometimes overwhelming.\u201cI certainly apologize to any woman who felt she was not treated appropriately, and of course if I run we will do better the next time,\u201d he said.The group \u201cOrganizing for Bernie\u201d said on Thursday that Mr. Pelletier, who was a leader of group, was no longer part of it \u201cin part due to concerns raised about personnel management related to his employment at Bernie 2016.\u201dAs Mr. Sanders considers his next steps, he has faced criticism for seemingly surrounding himself with many of the same people who worked on his last campaign, stoking anxiety that little would change should he run again.He still retains some of his support from the last campaign. But with some Democrats who supported him out of antipathy to Mrs. Clinton already drifting away, he can scarcely afford to lose more voters in the lead up to the primary.Mr. Sanders \u2014 who is loath to drift from his unrelenting focus on policy issues and for years has grumbled about the press\u2019s focus on what he calls \u201cpolitical gossip\u201d \u2014 plainly recognizes that he must show contrition for what took place in 2016.What is less clear is whether he is prepared to take any more steps to comprehensively address the conduct on his campaign. Both of his statements of apology came in response to media questions following detailed articles, and he has done little else to defuse the criticism arising from the issue.And when asked if he knew about the complaints in the interview with CNN last week, he said, \u201cI was a little bit busy running around the country trying to make the case\u201d \u2014 a curt response that was widely viewed as tone deaf to a sensitive issue.Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters are somewhat torn, not wanting to be seen as tolerating sexual misconduct but also deeply angry about what they see as unfair treatment of the senator by the news media and mainstream Democrats.Nomiki Konst, one of the most committed 2016 Sanders surrogates who is now running for Public Advocate in New York, said any claims of sexual harassment should be \u201cdealt with immediately\u201d and noted that \u201cit always helps to have more women in leadership.\u201dBut Ms. Konst also pointed out that former male aides to Mrs. Clinton and Senator Kamala Harris of California had also been accused of sexual misbehavior, and complained bitterly about what she called \u201cthe Bernie Bro smears\u201d that erased Mr. Sanders\u2019s female supporters.\u201c#Metoo is not a political weapon,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we start to use the #metoo movement as a political weapon it starts to weaken it.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: Progress in Talks to End the Trade War", "category": "Business", "id": "19728b13-7ca7-4e35-85e7-450f7bb5befd", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/business/dealbook/us-china-trade-war-talks.html", "publishdate": 20190110, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/11/business/11db-auto/merlin_148970304_fd5b9678-f53d-4b06-bf10-c924f6255751-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Thursday morning. Want this by email? Sign up here.Trade negotiators offer hope but few detailsTrade talks between midlevel American and Chinese officials, extended from a planned two days to three, ended yesterday in Beijing after negotiators made progress but released few details.What happened: According to U.S. officials, negotiators discussed intellectual property protections, so-called forced tech transfer and China\u2019s promise to buy \u201csubstantial\u201d amounts of American agricultural, energy and manufacturing products. China\u2019s commerce ministry spoke of \u201cextensive, in-depth and meticulous exchanges.\u201d Wang Qishan, China\u2019s vice president, said today that the two countries \u201cmust adapt to the new reality, keep looking for and expanding our common interests, deepening and promoting practical cooperation.\u201dWhat\u2019s next: No date or location is set for the next round of talks. Higher-level discussions could occur in Davos, Switzerland, if President Trump attends the World Economic Forum meeting there, starting Jan. 22. But he may cancel if the partial government shutdown is not resolved by then. China\u2019s economic czar is expected to visit Washington sometime after that. The Trump administration has set a March 2 deadline to wrap up negotiations, after which it says it could raise tariffs.What\u2019s at stake: If China and the U.S. let tensions escalate and investors pull back, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at enough of a tightening in financial conditions to say that a global recession is a real risk,\u201d Peter Hooper, a former Federal Reserve official and Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief economist, told Bloomberg.President Trump wants to calm volatile financial markets. And China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, needs to perk up a slowing economy. A measure of factory prices in China last month showed the slowest increase since late 2016. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told Bloomberg Television yesterday that there is \u201cpretty clear evidence that things have slowed down a fair amount in China.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of grounds for concern,\u201d he added.What else: \u2022 Auto importers in the Chinese port city of Tianjin are rushing to get American-made cars through customs, taking advantage of a temporary cut in the 40 percent tariff that Beijing imposed on them last July.\u2022 Amid suspicion from the F.B.I. and American universities, China is going quiet about its \u201cThousand Talents Program,\u201d which has attracted thousands of scientists and experts to the country since 2008.\u2022 The Hang Seng stock index in Hong Kong recorded its best day in more than a month yesterday and closed on its fifth straight rally today. U.S. equities also rose, though not as much as in recent days.____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________ImageSenator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi leaving the West Wing after meeting with President Trump.CreditCarlos Barria/ReutersA presidential \u2018tantrum\u2019 over the border wallWelcome to Day 20 of the shutdown, which could become the longest in history on Saturday. Yesterday, President Trump stormed out of a meeting with congressional leaders, throwing what Democrats described as a \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d over his demand to fund a border wall, a key sticking point in talks to reopen the government. On Twitter, he called the session \u201ca total waste of time.\u201d The NYT writes:The contentious, brief and futile session underscored an impasse that is looking each day like an insurmountable gulf between the two sides.Today, President Trump will visit the border in McAllen, Tex. Yesterday, he reiterated a threat to invoke emergency powers to fund his wall without congressional approval. That, writes Charlie Savage in the NYT, \u201cwould be an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms \u2014 and establish a precedent for presidents who fail to win approval for funding a policy goal.\u201dSome consequences of the stalemate:\u2022 In Washington, one of the richest areas in the country, it\u2019s affecting retailers, tourist centers, salons, garbage bins and more.\u2022 Nationwide, restaurants struggling with a severe worker shortage said they will continue hiring even though they can no longer check recruits\u2019 immigration status online.\u2022 Coast Guard employees received a five-page tip sheet suggesting that they could stay afloat without their paychecks through garage sales, babysitting, dog-walking, serving as \u201cmystery shoppers\u201d or, as a last resort, declaring bankruptcy.\u2022 This was expected to be a banner year for I.P.O.s. But with work halted at regulators, it could be only the fourth year since 1995 when no major company goes public in January. Other deals, including CVS\u2019s purchase of Aetna, could also be delayed.The Fed is ready to pauseTwo Federal Reserve officials said yesterday that the central bank should assess economic conditions before it considers raising rates again. And they did so as the Fed released the minutes of its December meeting, showing that it reached the same conclusion.The takeaway: Central bank officials are now not likely to raise the benchmark interest rate at their January meeting nor at one in mid-March, writes the NYT\u2019s Binyamin Appelbaum. But they still expect strong enough economic growth to justify increases this year.The reaction: Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, was criticized for not saying more to soothe investors in December. \u201cHe could have handled that differently, and better,\u201d one economist said. The dollar fell to a three-month low against the euro after the meeting minutes were released.The next step: The Fed is considering options to keep interest rates in its target range. One approach would be to slow the decline of bank reserves in the system.Brexit is becoming a divorce by committeeTheresa May, Britain\u2019s prime minister, is getting backed into a corner over Brexit \u2014 and she knows it.Her plans for how Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union will play out are strongly expected to be rejected by Parliament in a vote next week \u2014 two and a half years after Britons voted to leave the bloc in a referendum, and a month after this vote was first scheduled.Yesterday, lawmakers moved to block Mrs. May from stalling further. They have also passed a measure aimed at making it harder for the government to exit the E.U. without a deal.The withdrawal is scheduled for March 29. Many are concerned that, without an agreement with Brussels in place, economic chaos could ensue. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, meets with Mrs. May today, and automakers such as Honda, Nissan and Toyota, which manufacture in Britain for export into continental Europe, are pushing him to press the case against a no-deal Brexit.Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, pushed for fresh elections if Parliament turns down Mrs. May\u2019s plan. The British public is still deeply conflicted over the E.U., as shown in these charts from Bloomberg.ImageMoon Jae-in, South Korea\u2019s president.CreditPool photo by Jung Yeon-JeSouth Korea\u2019s bid for growth stumblesPresident Moon Jae-in of South Korea has embraced a pro-labor program of higher wages and taxes, but the early results have been discouraging, writes the NYT\u2019s Michael Schuman.Growth has slowed, unemployment has risen and small-business owners are complaining. The troubles suggest South Korea\u2019s limits in solving economic problems, especially without addressing underlying structural issues. Rapid changes like Mr. Moon\u2019s can also have unintended consequences. The biggest is the strain on small businesses, which are often unable to pass on higher costs to their customers.U.S.-North Korea talks:  A second summit meeting between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Trump to negotiate the terms of denuclearizing the North is \u201cclose,\u201d Mr. Moon said today after Mr. Kim\u2019s visit to China this week. He added that North Korea should take more concrete steps to secure U.S. concessions.Fiat\u2019s $650 million emissions settlementFiat Chrysler Automobiles will pay nearly $650 million to settle lawsuits over illegal software that allowed diesel vehicles to thwart emissions tests and release higher levels of pollutants, according to the NYT.The settlement, which is expected to be announced today, does not include an admission of guilt by the company or a declaration of wrongdoing by the Environmental Protection Agency. Earlier, the agency found that Fiat used technology that could turn off pollution controls under certain driving conditions.The Justice Department sued Fiat over the issue in 2017. The company will recall 104,000 diesel-powered Ram 1500 trucks and Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles to install new software.Other auto news: \u2022 Tesla\u2019s chief, Elon Musk, wrote on Twitter yesterday that it will stop selling the cheapest versions of its Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle from Monday, and suggested that the upcoming Roadster sports car might be able to levitate.\u2022 Rolls-Royce had record sales last year, as wealthy buyers spent some of their gains from the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts.\u2022 Toyota is recalling 1.7 million vehicles in North America, 1.3 million in the U.S., to replace potentially lethal Takata front passenger airbag inflaters.Revolving door\u2022 The Pixar co-founder John Lasseter, who resigned from Disney in June after complaints about unwanted touching, will build an animation production company affiliated with Paramount.

Bloomberg who could bankroll their own campaigns or finance others.Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts fired several  shots after entering the race last week, denouncing \u201ccampaigns that are funded by billionaires, whether it goes through super PACs or their own money.\u201d When Rachel Maddow of MSNBC asked if billionaire Democrats like Mr. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer should not run for president, Ms. Warren made a distinction.\u201cI just mean people should not be self-funding,\u201d she said.Senator Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist who is eyeing 2020, inveighed against \u201cthe billionaire class\u201d last week, and left-wing activists heckled Mr. Bloomberg over his wealth when he visited Iowa last month. Even Connie Schultz, the wife of Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, mocked suggestions that Mr. Bloomberg would spend $100 million or more on his own possible presidential campaign.\u201c\u2018I want a man who wants to buy himself a presidency,\u2019 I\u2019ve thought precisely never,\u201d Ms. Schultz, whose husband is eyeing a 2020 run, wrote on Twitter last month.As three dozen Democrats consider a 2020 run, potential candidates are taking populist positions on capitalism, income inequality, taxes and health care and embracing the favored label of the moment: \u201cprogressive.\u201d Many of them have little interest in the pragmatic politics and big-donor appeal of Hillary Clinton, the 2016 nominee. But with Democrats needing to define themselves in what will likely be a crowded field, the most liberal candidates are making an issue of wealth even though some of these billionaires have liberal policy views themselves.On Wednesday, Mr. Steyer took himself out of the 2020 running after weeks of hinting that he might enter the race. A fierce advocate of impeaching President Trump and a longtime environmentalist, Mr. Steyer sidestepped a question about Ms. Warren and self-financed campaigns as he announced he would focus his time and money on trying to get Mr. Trump impeached.\u201cI believe in the grass roots, just as Senator Warren does,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we have pushed for is the broadest possible democracy, power to the people, at all times. What we\u2019re saying is \u2014 what counts in this is the voice of the American people.\u201d[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Ms. Warren has moved out front quickly to use wealth as a cudgel against potential opponents and try to establish herself early with voters as a vanguard of middle-class and working-class concerns \u2014 a kind of \u201cpeople-not-the-powerful\u201d message that Democrats like Al Gore tried in the past. If they run, liberals like Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown and former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke are likely to advance similar arguments as well.Anti-billionaire populism is convenient for both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. Neither has the financial wherewithal to fund their own campaign, and both have well-developed lists of online donors. With ideological leftists ascendant in the party \u2014 like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her call for much higher taxes on the wealthy \u2014 their attacks on billionaires may appeal particularly to liberal millennials and middle-class workers in early caucus and primary states.\u201cIf you look at the entire period since the financial crisis, the resentment of corporations \u2014 and particularly how they failed to work for their own companies and their own workers \u2014 that resentment is strong,\u201d said Stan Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster. \u201cPeople really do believe they\u2019ve been buying influence. They think there\u2019s a nexus of C.E.O.s, corporations, big business and politicians that\u2019s corrupt.\u201dMs. Warren repeated her criticism of self-funded campaigns last Saturday in Iowa, on her first campaign swing to the early caucus state. \u201cNone of us want super PACs to help us and none of us believe the billionaires should be able to self-finance,\u201d she told a crowd in Des Moines.ImageSenator Elizabeth Warren struck a populist tone by criticizing self-funded campaigns on her first campaign swing to Iowa last weekend.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York TimesRob Hogg, a state senator and 2016 Democratic convention delegate, said the message could resonate with some Iowa voters. \u201cYou have the reaction from activists in both political parties that we\u2019re not sure we want this campaign to be bought,\u201d Mr. Hogg said.In South Carolina, an early primary state, a candidate\u2019s extreme wealth could be a turnoff to a state party membership that skews poorer than Democrats in the rest of the country, said Gibbs Knotts, a professor of political science at the College of Charleston. Many voters are fed up with the concentration of political power among the wealthy, he said.\u201cFor Democrats, given the unique character of the South Carolina Democratic electorate, I think that would be something that could be hard to overcome,\u201d said Mr. Knotts, who is writing a book about the South Carolina primary.Self-funding can cut both ways. Not only do candidates with vast resources have the ability to weather campaign setbacks that can dry up donations, they also can argue that they are not beholden to unpopular corporate interests.Laura Belin, a close Iowa caucus observer, said she doesn\u2019t think being a billionaire self-funder is necessarily a deal-breaker.\u201cI don\u2019t think of Iowans as automatically rejecting a billionaire candidate,\u201d said Ms. Belin, an author on the Bleeding Heartland blog. \u201cI feel like there are bigger issues for people that are more like litmus test issues, like Medicare for All.\u201dRather than accepting contributions from special-interest PACs whose backers fuel disgust, Mr. Bloomberg can point out that he made all the money himself \u2014 via his company that pioneered providing computerized data to investors \u2014 and owes nothing to anyone.\u201cHe\u2019s never taken a dime of any special interest money,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a top adviser to Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cThat fact has allowed him to act independently, totally on the merits, without ever having to wonder what donors or other special interests expect or want from him. Mike is somebody who did not grow up with privilege. He made all of his money on his own.\u201dMatt Mackowiak, an Austin-based Republican strategist, pointed to another advantage for Mr. Bloomberg.\u201cIn Bloomberg\u2019s case, he\u2019s been extremely generous in philanthropy over his life. It\u2019s hard to make a case that he\u2019s been selfish,\u201d said Mr. Mackowiak, suggesting that Mr. Bloomberg could counter criticism of his wealth by emphasizing his record of promoting the public good.While casting billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg as plutocrats may resonate among some Democrats, longtime party advisers point out that the strategy is tricky and that, by embracing it, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are ignoring historical reality: Several of the party\u2019s wealthiest leaders have been among its most progressive.\u201cIf you look at the last century, the people who did the most, in many ways, to advance progressive politics in the country \u2014 F.D.R. and the Kennedys \u2014 all came from great wealth,\u201d said Bob Shrum, a longtime adviser to Democratic candidates.Even so, Mr. Shrum, who teaches at the University of Southern California, said that almost any viable Democrat running this year will talk in some way about having a president who is there to serve the people, not the powerful, the theme that Mr. Shrum coined for use in Mr. Gore\u2019s 2000 campaign.Susan E. Howell, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of New Orleans, said that even in an era of populist backlash against the wealthy, the message could backfire.\u201cWhat\u2019s working against Warren and Sanders is that, let\u2019s face it, we are a capitalist country with a capitalist culture,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the working class in a large part, over time, has bought into this. This has been our culture, that you can work hard and become a Bloomberg.\u201dMr. Bloomberg, a businessman regarded as an economic centrist, was a loyal ally of Wall Street while he was mayor of New York City, but he has nevertheless embraced the liberal side of some of the country\u2019s most pressing social issues \u2014 including climate change and gun control. As mayor, he was known for fighting the tobacco and soft drink industries.He is rated 10th on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans, with a net worth of about $40 billion, and he has become a deep-pocketed force in progressive politics. Organizations controlled and funded by Mr. Bloomberg recently spent more than $100 million promoting two dozen Democratic congressional candidates in the 2018 midterm elections. Of those, 21 won.Mr. Wolfson pointed out that Mr. Bloomberg has been criticized before for self-funding his campaigns but still won in his three successive mayoral races \u2014 in which he spent close to $300 million. Running as a independent in 2009, he outspent his opponent, Bill Thompson, by 14 to 1. Despite wide speculation that he is running, Mr. Bloomberg has not entered the race.Paradoxically, in an era of populist backlash against the wealthy, more and more candidates are self-funding, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. There is evidence, though, that self-funders generally don\u2019t win in political campaigns, although it\u2019s not entirely clear why.Of 73 general-election candidates for governor who spent $1 million or more on their campaigns since 2000, only 25 won, according to data collected by National Institute for Money in Politics.ImageHoward Schultz, the former Starbucks C.E.O., has indicated he might consider running for president in 2020.CreditTed S. Warren/Associated PressAmong the Democrats mulling a 2020 run, at least one other billionaire could potentially self-fund a campaign \u2014 the former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz. He has been sharply critical of President Trump, and indicated last year that he might consider running for the White House.Mr. Schultz, whose net worth is estimated at $3.6 billion, did not respond to requests for comments on whether or when he would announce plans for 2020. But in a move that could help set the stage for a bid, Mr. Schultz is set to begin a national tour to promote his new book, with the first stop scheduled for Jan. 28 in New York."}, {"title": "Judge Dismisses Part of Ashley Judd\u2019s Lawsuit Against Harvey Weinstein", "category": "Business", "id": "2563ee3b-59c2-4cae-b471-da0e983f38e4", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/business/media/ashley-judd-lawsuit-harvey-weinstein.html", "publishdate": 20190110, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/10/us/10weinstein2/merlin_143958450_786c23c7-cd57-41d2-947f-83d3af33b9f4-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 A federal judge dismissed part of Ashley Judd\u2019s multipronged lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein on Wednesday, ruling that her allegations of sexual harassment do not fall within the scope of a California statute.The order by Judge Philip S. Gutierrez of United States District Court in Los Angeles does not end Ms. Judd\u2019s case, which is built around other claims, including defamation and unfair business practices. In a suit filed in May, she claimed that her career withered because Mr. Weinstein spread lies about her in Hollywood after she rejected his sexual requests.\u201cNothing about today\u2019s ruling changes that Ms. Judd\u2019s case is moving forward on multiple claims,\u201d Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., the lead lawyer representing Ms. Judd, said in a statement.Judge Gutierrez\u2019s 13-page order on Wednesday made it clear that he was making no judgment on whether Ms. Judd had been sexually harassed by Mr. Weinstein \u201cin the colloquial sense of the term.\u201d Rather, the ruling was limited to whether a recent change in California sexual harassment law applied to Ms. Judd, who has said in court filings that Mr. Weinstein, appearing in a bathrobe during a business meeting at his hotel in the 1990s, asked her to submit to a massage and watch him shower. Ms. Judd previously recounted the episode in an interview with The New York Times.ImageA federal judge said that new sexual harassment laws in California do not retroactively apply to Ms. Judd\u2019s accusations against Mr. Weinstein.CreditMark Lennihan/Associated PressMr. Weinstein has denied engaging in nonconsensual sexual activity.\u201cWe have said from the beginning that this claim was unjustified, and we are pleased that the court saw it as we did,\u201d Phyllis Kupferstein, a lawyer for Mr. Weinstein, said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that we will ultimately prevail on her remaining claims.\u201dIn September, Judge Gutierrez ruled that Ms. Judd could not claim sexual harassment because she did not have a specific business relationship with Mr. Weinstein at the time \u2014 a requirement of the statute. But the court allowed Ms. Judd to amend the sexual harassment part of her complaint and resubmit it. Her lawyers did so, citing end-of-year revisions to California sexual harassment laws and arguing that the changes should be applied retroactively.It is rare for people to recover damages for smear campaigns \u2014 for instance, quietly labeling actresses as \u201cdifficult\u201d when they do not acquiesce to powerful men \u2014 because of how complicated it can be to prove the action took place, much less harmed a career. But Ms. Judd has an A-list director on her side: Peter Jackson, who came forward early last year to say he removed Ms. Judd from a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d casting list \u201cas a direct result\u201d of what he now thought was \u201cfalse information\u201d provided by Mr. Weinstein.In her original suit for defamation, Ms. Judd said that, until Mr. Jackson came forward, she did not know that \u201csomething unseen was holding her back from obtaining the work she wanted, and had been doing so for decades.\u201dSeparately, Mr. Weinstein faces a criminal trial in New York City this year. He faces charges that he raped one woman and forced another to allow him to perform oral sex on her."}, {"title": "The Political Benefits of Shutting It Down", "category": "Politics", "id": "a0b2b91d-147e-4872-ab15-c4f075c4c7ab", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/on-politics-shutdown-democrats-republicans.html", "publishdate": 20190110, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/10/us/politics/10onpolitics-border/10onpolitics-border-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.[Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]Cash-strapped government workers  are worried about buying food and making rent. Trash and human feces (seriously!) are piling up in national parks. Even the Secret Service is feeling stressed.And yet, 19 days into what\u2019s become the country\u2019s second-longest government shutdown, there\u2019s no compromise in sight, and no additional negotiations scheduled.The problem, of course, is politics. The shutdown hinges on a border wall battle that\u2019s become about so much more than a wall. In many ways, President Trump\u2019s fight for his \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d is a metaphor for the current politics of Washington.You have a broadly unpopular Republican president, already operating under a cloud of investigations, obsessed with keeping his promises to his supporters ahead of what\u2019s expected to be a tough re-election race. And you have a Democratic opposition equally driven by their voters to oppose him at every turn.Those politics are the undercurrent for all the talks about the shutdown, and they\u2019re fundamentally at odds with each other. And each sides sees political benefit to holding out and resisting any sort of compromise.Here\u2019s what Democrats see:\u2022 Midterm wins. Democrats won control of the House despite efforts by the president to turn the final weeks of the campaign into a referendum on undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump couldn\u2019t get his wall funded when he controlled both houses of Congress. Why should they give now, Democrats argue, if his own party wouldn\u2019t?\u2022 The base. Yes, some Democrats have backed border fencing in the past. But Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line policies, which Democrats see as racist and xenophobic, have pushed the party to the left. And it\u2019s harder to cut deals when the debate becomes about morality.\u2022 The dealmaker has no clothes. Storming out a meeting after saying \u201cbye-bye\u201d isn\u2019t a good look for any president, Democrats believe, but particularly one who ran on his ability to negotiate. The broader impact of the shutdown cuts through the theatrics the president typically uses to get out of tricky situations.\u2022 Jumpy Republicans. On Wednesday night, eight House Republicans broke with the president and voted for a Democratic bill that would reopen the Treasury Department. At least four G.O.P. Senators have expressed some support for reopening the government. The most jittery of all? Republicans up for re-election in purple states.What the White House sees:\u2022 The other base. Mr. Trump measures his political success by whether he keeps his supporters happy. That\u2019s part of why he rejected a deal on the shutdown negotiated by his own aides and G.O.P. leaders after conservatives voiced opposition. And his base wants that wall.\u2022 Mueller? Mueller? The constant focus on the shutdown provides Mr. Trump and the White House with a break from the story line that really makes them nervous: the special counsel investigation.What Republicans see: \u2022 Opposition to Mr. Trump never pays. There are 19 Senate Republicans up for re-election next year in red states. A lesson many took away from the president\u2019s support of primary challengers during 2018 midterms was that Republican establishment doesn\u2019t win by contradicting Mr. Trump.\u2022 A longer timeline. The decisions by the White House to pay out food stamps through February and process tax refunds means Republicans have a bit more breathing room. Particularly in poorer districts, extending these programs provides essential cash infusions to large parts of their voting base.\u2022 The elusive deal. Senate Republicans have grown increasingly aggravated with the lack of clarity from the White House, leaving them unsure about whether Mr. Trump would even sign a deal they managed to cut with Democrats. That\u2019s part of why the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has kept his distance from the talks. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult,\u201d Senator John Cornyn told The Washington Post, \u201cwhen the person you\u2019re negotiating with is someone who changes his mind.\u201dBut don\u2019t forget this:Elections are not won or lost on shutdowns.In 1995 and 1996, Americans blamed the Republican Congress for shutdowns. The party held onto its majorities in the 1996 election. In 2013, Americans once again blamed Republicans for the shutdown. In the midterms that followed the next year, the party gained seats in the House and won back the Senate.Have you been personally affected by the shutdown? Tell us about it: OnPolitics@nytimes.com. Our inbox is always open!____________________ImageFact check: Trump and the borderAfter a day of fruitless negotiations over the wall, President Trump traveled to a border town in Texas today to make his case. We decided to check in with Linda Qiu, The Times\u2019s fact checker, and test the veracity of some of the president\u2019s recent talk about the border.Lisa: In his prime-time address on Tuesday, the president said the southern border was at a crisis point. What do you make of that? Have things gotten considerably worse down there? Linda: Mr. Trump said the word \u201ccrisis\u201d six times in that nine-minute address! But there\u2019s not really a good case for a border crisis. Illegal border crossings have been declining for about two decades. I\u2019ll bore you with some numbers now: From the 1980s to mid-2000s, apprehensions at the southwest border were between 1 million and 1.6 million annually. Last year, the number was just under 400,000. Now, there has been an uptick in monthly crossings in October and November, to about 50,000 apprehensions each month. But compare that to 2000, when the monthly number was between 70,000 and 220,000.It\u2019s also interesting to me that Mr. Trump has sort of stopped trying to use data to support his arguments. Instead, he\u2019s talking more about \u201cAngel Families\u201d \u2014 people whose loved ones were killed by undocumented immigrants \u2014 as he did in the speech on Tuesday night and during a round-table today. (And some of these families really appreciate the president advocating on their behalf!) But certainly, it\u2019s more beneficial for him to highlight these specific tragedies than talk about the body of research that shows that immigration does not lead to more crime, and that immigrants are actually less like to commit crimes than native-born Americans.So at the end of the day, it\u2019s an emotional appeal, rather than a statistical or empirical argument about any \u201ccrisis.\u201dLisa: The appeal to emotions reminds me of the migrant caravan, which the president helped turn into a national story ahead of the midterm elections. What happened to the caravan? Did the migrants ever come to the U.S.?Linda: Some migrants certainly did try. Remember that televised clash in late November? Hundreds of migrants attempted to run toward a border crossing in San Diego, and Customs and Border Protection closed the border and fired tear gas into the crowd. Our colleagues who have been traveling with the caravan also reported in December that about 2,000 have made appointments with immigration officials to petition for asylum \u2014 which is perfectly legal \u2014 and they\u2019re facing long waiting times. A lot of migrants have also decided to just stay in Mexico for the time being. And some have attempted to cross the border illegally.Now that Washington is at an impasse over the president\u2019s border wall, Mr. Trump has been talking caravans again. This time he\u2019s warning of a new caravan forming in Honduras. And I imagine this won\u2019t be the last time we hear him talking ominously about groups of migrants coming to the southern border.For more, check out Linda\u2019s Fact-Check of the Day.

The message: She\u2019s a unifier in a time of deep polarization and division.\u201cWe\u2019re at an inflection moment, not only in the history of our country but the history of our world,\u201d Ms. Harris said on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. \u201cThere are a lot of people who rightly feel displaced. They are wondering: Where do they belong? Are they relevant? Are they seen? Are we thinking about them?\u201d\u201cWe need leadership has a vision of the future in which everyone can see themselves,\u201d she said.Though Ms. Harris is expected to announce her presidential candidacy in the coming weeks, a source close to the senator said there\u2019s no imminent plans on when that will happen. Ms. Harris will be in New York City Friday, for a book event at the famed 92nd Street Y on the Upper East Side.This week she also tweeted a call for nationalized legal marijuana and said incarcerated persons who were convicted on nonviolent marijuana-related charges should have their records expunged.Ms. Harris has, at times, come under fire from social justice activists who say her tenure as California attorney general did not match her progressive rhetoric. It is one of several challenges facing Ms. Harris\u2019s candidacy, which will be one of the first viable campaigns for president launched by a nonwhite woman.[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.]____________________What to read tonight\u2022 Scientists have found that the oceans are heating up 40 percent faster than a U.N. panel estimated five years ago, and that ocean temperatures have broken records for several straight years.\u2022 Video games as a varsity sport?

By 2011 Volkswagen had built a growing following for its diesel Jetta, Beetle and other models, and other automakers raced to offer their own clean diesel models.Fiat Chrysler introduced diesel versions of its Ram 1500 pickup and Jeep Grand Cherokee in 2014.For a time, environmental scientists marveled at the vehicles, which offered power and efficiency for moderate prices while seeming to emit far less pollution than older diesel engines. But research at West Virginia University eventually showed that while Volkswagen\u2019s diesels passed emissions tests, they released far more pollutants than allowed in real-world driving.In 2015, Volkswagen acknowledged that its diesel cars were equipped with software that activated robust emissions controls in testing but disabled them at other times, a revelation whose legal and reputational costs continue to reverberate. After that, the United States Environmental Protection Agency began looking more closely at other companies that made diesel vehicles, and Fiat Chrysler was one of them.In 2017, the Justice Department sued the company over the E.P.A.\u2019s finding that Fiat Chrysler had used illegal engine-control software that turned off pollution controls under certain driving conditions. The E.P.A. contended that the software enabled the vehicles to pass emissions tests while allowing them to release higher levels of pollutants in normal driving, conduct the agency called \u201cserious and egregious.\u201dUnder the settlement announced Thursday, the company will pay $305 million in civil penalties in connection with those claims and another $6 million over allegations of illegally importing noncompliant vehicles.It will also pay $19 million to mitigate excess emissions from noncompliant vehicles in California, which also sued the company.\u201cFiat Chrysler\u2019s effort to defeat emissions controls is a clear violation of the law, and they also tried to hide their actions,\u201d the E.P.A.\u2019s acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said in a conference call. \u201cThe E.P.A. caught them cheating.\u201dAs part of the agreement, Fiat Chrysler will recall about 100,000 diesel-powered Ram 1500 trucks and Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicles from the 2014, 2015 and 2016 model years. The recall repair involves installing new software in the vehicles and providing extended warranties, at a total cost of up to $185 million, the Justice Department said.Fiat Chrysler said vehicle owners could expect the recall later this year.In addition, owners will be eligible for compensation of $990 to $3,075 from Fiat Chrysler and Bosch, a German company that supplied engine computers and software. That agreement that could cost up to $300 million. Fiat Chrysler said it would bear an estimated $280 million of that cost.The Justice Department said the settlement did not resolve any potential criminal liability.\u201cA multinational bad actor has seriously violated American emissions laws, to the detriment of the health and welfare of the American people,\u201d said Jeffrey Clark, assistant attorney general in the department\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division.Fiat Chrysler, however, has said that its software did not amount to an illegal defeat device. \u201cOur position on that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Eric Mayne, a company spokesman.The settlement amount was in line with the $800 million that the company set aside in October to cover it, and its stock closed up 1.5 percent on Thursday.Analysts said the company was unlikely to suffer any significant damage to its reputation with American consumers, or any long-lasting decline in sales. \u201cIf sales do drop, I think they\u2019ll pop back up pretty quickly,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an executive analyst at Autotrader.Fiat Chrysler is coming off a strong year in North America. Although the company\u2019s profit fell on a global basis in the first nine months of 2018, its North American division\u2019s pretax profits rose 17 percent.The company is benefiting from a decision in 2015 to focus on trucks and S.U.V.s, which have higher profit margins than smaller vehicles. In the United States, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s new-vehicle sales rose 9 percent in 2018, while the overall market grew just 1 percent. Fiat Chrysler stopped making sedans in the United States five years ago and has added more high-margin variants of its trucks and Jeeps, a move Ford Motor is making only now.The company still faces challenges, however. It has not pushed into electric vehicles and self-driving technology as aggressively as Ford, General Motors and some other companies have, though its Pacifica minivan is being used in Waymo\u2019s autonomous-vehicle testing.In addition, its chief executive, Mike Manley, has been on the job for just six months. He succeeded Sergio Marchionne, who died in July at 66 after shoulder surgery.United States officials viewed the Fiat Chrysler matter as less serious in some respects than the Volkswagen case because it involved fewer vehicles and the trucks and S.U.V.s had been on the road for less time. The E.P.A. also stopped short of accusing the company of intentionally engineering the software to cheat on emissions tests.Volkswagen pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and other charges brought by the Justice Department. The company agreed to pay $22 billion in settlements and fines, including $4.3 billion to settle a case brought by federal prosecutors. It also was required to buy back 600,000 diesel vehicles from American consumers. Two Volkswagen executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges in the United States."}, {"title": "On Conservative Media, Qualified Support for Trump on Shutdown", "category": "Politics", "id": "e00f6ebe-2359-457d-818e-a36454165929", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/us/politics/government-shutdown-media-coverage.html", "publishdate": 20190111, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/12/us/politics/12shutdown-media-1-print/merlin_148929429_c0ee26c7-2112-431a-aa61-ff76de5db4ab-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The government shutdown and partisan wrangling over a wall at the southern border have produced high political drama in Washington, where President Trump has sought to portray the impasse as a national emergency.And as the shutdown reached a record 22nd day on Saturday, Americans following local and national media coverage would be forgiven for thinking they had fallen into a parallel universe \u2014 with the episode being presented both as a moment of crisis and hardship, and a curiosity that mostly registered as a politically motivated annoyance.Early in the week, the historically conservative Cincinnati Enquirer labeled the paralysis a \u201cbuzzkill,\u201d warning readers that the lag in government approval of new beer labels could reduce the output from local breweries. Several days later it reported on 40 Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky government employees protesting outside a local I.R.S. processing center, focusing on the financial difficulties furloughed employees face, like day care expenses and rent payments.Polls show that more Americans blame the president for the shutdown than blame congressional Democrats. But there is a very stark partisan divide, with a large majority of Republicans supporting Mr. Trump.And while conservative media has been mostly supportive of the president, its coverage has sometimes diverged from Mr. Trump\u2019s tone of crisis.In Beaumont, Tex., a moderate city in a red district near Houston, the Beaumont Enterprise editorial board welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to the border on Thursday but urged both sides to compromise.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that Trump has done more to inflame this standoff than Democrats,\u201d the paper wrote. \u201cThe goal must be a solution, not a continuation of this costly governmental stalemate.\u201dThe Dallas Morning News published an editorial this week that took particular aim at Mr. Trump for waging a potentially unwinnable fight that focuses on crime, questioned his \u201cmoral credibility\u201d and urged him to offer a deal that protects immigrant children in exchange for the wall he wants.But Robert Pratt, a popular conservative radio talk-show host in Lubbock, and a former head of the county Republican Party, recently criticized the news media for focusing on government workers affected by the shutdown.The Government Shutdown Was the Longest Ever. Here\u2019s the History.The roots of Washington\u2019s budget dysfunction date to the 1970s. Here\u2019s a look at past shutdowns and how they led to today\u2019s.\u201cThe temporary plight of government workers is treated as a national crisis while the perpetual plight of millions more who take huge risks, work long hours to create jobs, and build and maintain the economy rarely gets a mention,\u201d he wrote.There has even been some conflicting commentary in the Fox News firmament.Brian Kilmeade, a co-host of the reliably pro-Trump \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d said on Thursday\u2019s program that the declaration of a national emergency to fund a wall, which the president is considering, \u201cwould just be a disaster in the big picture, and just show us being inept and unable to govern around the world.\u201dThe host went on to suggest that future presidents could use a similar tactic for purposes that may be less aligned with the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d worldview. \u201cIt would just set a terrible precedent,\u201d Mr. Kilmeade said, as his co-hosts listened silently. \u201cThe next president, if it is a liberal president, will say a state of emergency will be climate change.\u201dMr. Kilmeade\u2019s break from Trump orthodoxy followed a tough exchange last weekend between the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d moderator Chris Wallace and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.The harsh questioning of Ms. Sanders led to the president dropping one of his key talking points \u2014 an inaccurate claim that thousands of terrorists were crossing the border \u2014 in favor of a wall.Many of Fox News\u2019s commentators, however, have been supportive of the president. In an online column on Wednesday titled \u201cTrump\u2019s plea for a wall is more than about stats \u2014 it\u2019s about saving lives,\u201d Sean Hannity echoed many of the president\u2019s arguments from his Oval Office speech on Tuesday, citing the same statistics about crime and opioid deaths. \u201cThis is a national emergency,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Hannity wrote, conveying Mr. Trump\u2019s dark tone. \u201cThe situation is now dire.\u201dAnother columnist, Charlie Kirk, wrote that, politically, Mr. Trump had trapped Democrats, \u201cessentially forcing them to say: We support border security and we support reopening the entire federal government, but we don\u2019t support border security enough to take action to reopen the entire federal government.\u201dThe belief that Democrats are to blame for the shutdown has been mostly consistent across right-wing media. In an interview that the conservative Sinclair Broadcast Group required all of its stations to run, Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, told the political analyst Boris Epshteyn \u2014 a former top aide to Mr. Trump \u2014 that the shutdown was a test of whether Democrats wanted to \u201cdo anything other than the status quo.\u201d\u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d Mr. Epshteyn said at the end of the segment, which aired across the country this week. \u201cIt is highly irresponsible for congressional Democrats to let their disdain for the president and their insistence on playing partisan politics stand in the way of securing our country. Let\u2019s hope the Democrats come to the table soon and end this partial government shutdown.\u201dImmediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s Oval Office speech on Tuesday, in response to a caller on WNIR in Akron, Ohio, the conservative radio personality Jim Isabella said the president had successfully gotten Congress\u2019s top two Democrats \u2014 Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer \u2014 to \u201ctake a cheap shot at him.\u201dImageSean Hannity, left, with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law. Mr. Hannity interviewed Mr. Trump during his trip to the border in McAllen, Tex., on Thursday.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times\u201cHe was the adult in the room tonight,\u201d Mr. Isabella said.Rush Limbaugh, the right-wing talk radio host, praised Mr. Trump for refusing to give ground.\u201cWe have a president keeping promises left and right,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said on Wednesday. \u201cAnd isn\u2019t it interesting to see how trivial Washington thinks that is?\u201dBut in some corners of conservative media, the sentiment supporting the president was more nuanced.Raheem Kassam, a fellow at the conservative Claremont Institute and a columnist for The Daily Caller, wrote on Tuesday that the shutdown was \u201cof course being leveraged by the Democrats and the establishment media,\u201d but that it was working in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor. He added that he didn\u2019t think arguments about the shutdown\u2019s impact on government workers would be effective.\u201cThat\u2019s a tough sell to most Americans, who don\u2019t have half the luxuries or benefits of federal employees,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Trump can continue looking like a steward of security and humanitarian concerns throughout his visit to the border on Thursday, there\u2019s a very good chance he has the wall in the bag.\u201dOther outlets called outright for the president to back down. After Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado supported the reopening of the government \u2014 the first Republican senator to do so \u2014 Colorado Peak Politics, which bills itself as the state\u2019s \u201cconservative bully pulpit,\u201d published an editorial titled \u201cEND THE SHUTDOWN.\u201dDavid Brody, the chief political correspondent for the Christian Broadcasting Network, which reaches a largely evangelical Christian audience, said he had been focusing not so much on the policy issues as on \u201cthe breakdown of civility between Democrats and Republicans.\u201d\u201cFrom a Christian perspective, that\u2019s been a big part,\u201d Mr. Brody said in a phone interview.As the debate raged in many parts of the nation, others remained unperturbed. It seemed at times that the big divide was not over who was right \u2014 in conservative circles, many people agreed that it was the president \u2014 but over how important it really was.\u201cPeople are not as concerned out here about the shutdown and don\u2019t feel affected,\u201d Jim Hoft, founder and editor of The Gateway Pundit, said in a phone interview, referring to the Midwest. That being said, he added that many conservatives in the Midwest felt that Democrats were preventing Mr. Trump from making the country safer, and that most of his readers \u201csupport the president on this issue.\u201dFor many Americans, as federal workers missed their first paycheck, the effects became more visceral, and the blame game less important. That was reflected in the Cincinnati Enquirer\u2019s article on the I.R.S. protests this week.The story quoted a union leader, Debbie Mullikin, saying that some furloughed workers were at risk of homelessness. \u201cMullikin said she isn\u2019t sure who to blame for the shutdown,\u201d the article said, \u201cbut that isn\u2019t the point.\u201d"}, {"title": "\u2018Deciding How to Decide\u2019: Even the Rich Need Advice on Budgeting", "category": "Business", "id": "55a3f318-d15e-429f-a6bb-e6de393eb4e8", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/your-money/budgeting-for-wealthy-rich.html", "publishdate": 20190111, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/12/business/12WEALTH-01/merlin_149007720_c2a2de48-1440-4b9d-bbdd-57c96929ae23-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "If you\u2019re worried about your credit card bills from the holidays, you\u2019re not alone: Even the wealthiest Americans, who have little chance of running out of money, are concerned about their spending.A document circulating internally among Merrill Lynch\u2019s private banking and investment group, which will be released in the next couple of months, aims to help Merrill\u2019s rich clients budget like everyone else.The document, called \u201cConsiderations for Decision-Making Around Expenditures,\u201d was developed after a wealthy client worried aloud to his adviser about taking a vacation.\u201cGiven his net worth, cash flow and asset base, he could more than afford any conceivable vacation,\u201d said Valerie Galinskaya, director of the Center for Family Wealth Dynamics and Governance at Merrill Lynch\u2019s private banking and investment group.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a question of can I afford this but what should I be spending on?\u201d Ms. Galinskaya said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the right amount to spend and how do you communicate that to family? Our goal is to make the process interactive and empowering.\u201dA skeptic would ask how a billionaire \u2014 or even someone who\u2019s merely wealthy \u2014 could possibly run into financial problems. The mathematical answer is that it\u2019s probably not possible to dissipate a fortune like that by overspending on baubles in a generation or even two.But, said Stacy Allred, a managing director in the same group, that\u2019s probably not the best way to look at it. \u201cJust because you can doesn\u2019t mean you should\u201d spend freely, she said.Fear, after all, underpins concerns about spending. The people who made the money worry that subsequent generations could fritter it away.The guide proposes different frameworks to look at spending that can also be applied to the not-so-wealthy.It starts by defining spending. It includes lifestyle expenditures like travel, cars and wine; financial gifts to friends and family; charitable contributions; and even taxes. It looks at not only impulse buys but all the stuff in our lives that we spend money on, voluntarily or involuntarily: the big expenses like the mortgage on the house or homes and insurance, and the smaller, not-so-regular costs like maintenance, repairs and occasional remodeling of those homes.It\u2019s the art but also the security system. It\u2019s what people want to give to charity or have pledged to donate to organizations. It\u2019s taxes.Coming to terms with all that spending can be time-consuming. Before I heard about the Merrill guide, my wife and I created a list of everything we spent money on last year, divided by vendors. We discovered that the expenses were not at all what we had thought. We spent way more on food and children\u2019s activities and less on technology than I had expected. I also didn\u2019t buy as much golf-related apparel as I had thought, though my wife interpreted that number differently.It wasn\u2019t easy to get it all down on paper, but it did form a basis for discussion.\u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at it in the broader context, it\u2019s about balancing the different spending priorities,\u201d Ms. Allred said. \u201cThen, what you see is families get more comfortable with their expenditures and spend more on experiences instead of stuff.\u201dIn some ways, the spending plans described in the Merrill guide could be likened to a diet. They lay out a more attainable fitness plan, with the consequences of late-night snacking explained. (In addressing spending with clients, Merrill is not alone. All of the big wire house firms, like J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley, ask clients about their spending, as would many registered investment advisers. Knowing how much is going out is key to making retirement projections for the assets that are being managed.)ImageValerie Galinskaya, director of Merrill Lynch\u2019s Center for Family Wealth Dynamics and Governance, helps affluent families set spending priorities. \u201cOur goal is to make the process interactive and empowering,\u201d she said.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York Times\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is help families make informed decisions,\u201d Ms. Allred said. \u201cIt\u2019s super important that there was some rigor around this.\u201dFor one, spending influences the amount of wealth someone has. That seems obvious, but to make the consequences apparent, the guide asks people to think about what they want to happen to the money they\u2019ve accumulated. There are only four choices: Spend it down, keep it at the current level, preserve its buying power by having its value keep up with inflation, or spend or invest it to grow as much as possible.Ms. Allred said few very wealthy people chose to spend their wealth down to zero \u2014 though she worked with one client who would be fine if that happened. But increasing wealth while spending heavily is difficult without additional sources of income. If a portfolio grows at 5 percent a year, for example, but inflation is 3 percent and taxes are 2 percent, there isn\u2019t a lot of room for spending if you want your net worth to grow.The guide also recommends thinking proactively, not reactively, with spending. This works easily for family spending on philanthropy (and, less enjoyably, property taxes). The family can plan out the charities it wants to donate to and not worry about arguments afterward.Still, thinking proactively isn\u2019t what you always want to do, particularly with lifestyle purchases. It may be wiser to consider if you really need that new golf club or pair of shoes that caught your eye.In these instances, the guide advises employing a technique called \u201cprospective hindsight,\u201d which pushes people to imagine how they would feel if their action turned out positively versus how they would feel if the same act had negative consequences.\u201cYou\u2019re trying to bring the future to the present,\u201d Ms. Allred said. \u201cWe tend to be overly optimistic and suffer from confirmation bias,\u201d a term from behavioral economics that means we tend to believe what happens more if it matches a previous belief.Arguments about spending, particularly within families, are sure to arise. Setting out guidelines on how people in a family can spend money can keep any fallout from devolving into recriminations.\u201cDeciding how to decide is really important,\u201d Ms. Galinskaya said.Wealthy families working with advisers are likely to be pressed about their values. Those values are meant to shape the conversation between generations. And that can extend to spending.Ms. Allred said one family she worked with had a motto to translate values: \u201cWe value quiet demonstrations of wealth and avoid flashy big.\u201d One of the daughters said it was a nice grounding point when she bought a house.And although wealthy people often turn to advisers to help their money grow, spending is at the crux of what all good advisers do for their clients. It\u2019s impossible to calculate how much money someone might need later in life without knowing how much money he or she plans to spend.There are some cases where people are spending a lot and, from a financial perspective, can afford it. (What message it sends to heirs is a different story.)\u201cIf that big macro number is sustainable, the question is: Do you want to make any changes?\u201d said Lee Miller, regional director of the New York office for Glenmede Trust, an adviser to wealthy families. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t a driver to do something else, you really don\u2019t need to make any changes. It\u2019s all about learning to make choices.\u201dYet, she said, older clients need to be careful about where their spending money is coming from, particularly if the economy is headed into a recession or the market is headed into a strong correction.\u201cIf we have a client with lots of Texas real estate, we ask: Is it sustainable, or do we have to plan for longer-term risks?\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a great return, but what if you need the cash?\u201dThe answer will be tough if you\u2019ve spent too much."}, {"title": "Carlos Ghosn Faces New Charges in Japan as Pressure Mounts", "category": "Business", "id": "c3fd5c23-3f90-4874-b78b-ac684877fa83", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/business/carlos-ghosn-nissan-charges.html", "publishdate": 20190111, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/12/world/12ghosn-print/merlin_148851318_4eb4f3b9-95fe-4d62-88bf-292978aa2542-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "TOKYO \u2014 Japanese prosecutors brought fresh charges of financial wrongdoing on Friday against Carlos Ghosn, the embattled global auto chief who sits in a Tokyo jail.The new allegations raise the stakes in a showdown between Mr. Ghosn, until recently the head of the vast car-making alliance of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, and the prosecutors, who have been working in tandem with whistle-blowers inside Nissan. It also signals that prosecutors remain undeterred by Mr. Ghosn\u2019s recent assertion of innocence in court.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s lawyers said they had applied for his release on bail, but the court was not expected to rule until at least Tuesday and could still choose to hold the executive for months.Mr. Ghosn, his top aide Greg Kelly and Nissan are now charged with understating Mr. Ghosn\u2019s income through March 2018, according to a statement from the Tokyo District Court. Mr. Ghosn was also charged with improperly transferring personal losses to Nissan\u2019s books in 2008.Mr. Ghosn has been detained since November, when prosecutors seized him shortly after his corporate jet touched down at a Tokyo airport. He was later indicted, along with Mr. Kelly and Nissan itself, on suspicion of withholding millions of dollars in income from Nissan financial filings between 2011 and 2015, when he was both chairman and chief executive of the company. Mr. Kelly, who suffered from spinal stenosis, was released on bail on Christmas Day after 30 days in detention so that he could undergo surgery in Tokyo.Now, Mr. Ghosn has been ousted as chairman by both Nissan and Mitsubishi, though he remains on Nissan\u2019s board, throwing the alliance into turmoil. Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan\u2019s chief executive and a one-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Ghosn, has rebuked his former boss, describing him as a \u201cmastermind\u201d of a long-running scheme to mislead financial authorities. Mr. Saikawa has not been accused of any crime.On Friday, Nissan said in a statement submitted to prosecutors that the company had been harmed by Mr. Ghosn\u2019s conduct, alleging that the former chief had engaged in the \u201cmisuse of a significant amount of the company\u2019s funds.\u201dThe company added, \u201cNissan does not in any way tolerate such misconduct and calls for strict penalties.\u201dMr. Ghosn has denied the allegations, declaring at his first appearance at a court proceeding on Tuesday that he had been \u201cwrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations.\u201dMr. Ghosn\u2019s lawyers said Friday that they expected the court to rule on their bail request Tuesday after a long holiday weekend. Motonari Otsuru, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s lead lawyer in Tokyo and a former top prosecutor, has speculated that the authorities will seek to deny bail and that the executive\u2019s detention could stretch for months as the two sides head to court.If the local court declines the bail request, Mr. Ghosn can legally be held for two more months. After that, prosecutors are entitled to request one-month extensions.Ostensibly, bail could be denied on the grounds that as long as Mr. Ghosn continues to assert his innocence, he could flee the country or seek to destroy evidence, said Nobuo Gohara, a former prosecutor who is critical of Japan\u2019s criminal justice system.But he said that such concerns were unfounded, because the Japanese authorities could easily block Mr. Ghosn from leaving the country and evidence has already been seized.Still, \u201cuntil suspects admit to their crimes, they are usually held,\u201d Mr. Gohara said. \u201cIt\u2019s like they are being held hostage.\u201dYet Mr. Kelly was released; as a condition of his bail, he is not allowed to leave Japan. His lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, said he had rented an apartment on his client\u2019s behalf. Mr. Kelly\u2019s wife, Donna Kelly, was in Tokyo for Mr. Kelly\u2019s surgery and is staying with him in the apartment, Mr. Kitamura said.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s detention has cast a critical light on Japan\u2019s criminal justice system. Mr. Ghosn \u2014 who has been formally arrested three times, prolonging his detention \u2014 has faced interrogation without a lawyer, and so far he has been permitted to see only diplomats or his Japanese lawyer.On Thursday, Mr. Ghosn came down with a fever, his local counsel said, raising concerns over the 64-year-old executive\u2019s health. He was allowed to rest for a day on advice from government doctors, and his temperature was back to normal Friday morning, according to an update from his attorneys.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s wife, Carole Ghosn, who has not seen her husband since his arrest, issued a plea on Thursday for more information on his condition.\u201cI am pleading with the Japanese authorities to provide us with any information at all about my husband\u2019s health,\u201d she said from Paris, where the couple maintains a home. \u201cWe are fearful and very worried his recovery will be complicated while he continues to endure such harsh conditions and unfair treatment.\u201dMr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly were initially indicted on charges of understating Mr. Ghosn\u2019s earnings from April 2010 to March 2015 by half in securities filings. On Friday, prosecutors added charges that the two also understated Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation by more than half between April 2015 and March 2018.Across the entire period, the two are accused of understating Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation by about $83 million. They say he reported compensation of 7.9 billion yen, or $73.2 million, compared with actual compensation of \u00a517 billion, or $156.9 million.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s lawyers have argued that the deferred amounts were not fixed commitments and did not need to be disclosed. Mr. Kelly has denied wrongdoing as well.Mr. Ghosn is further accused of temporarily transferring investment losses he faced during the global financial crisis of 2008 onto Nissan\u2019s books, which prosecutors say violates Japanese corporate law. His attorneys said that the transactions were legitimate and approved by the company\u2019s board, and that they didn\u2019t lead to losses for the company.The events have shaken foreign businesspeople in Japan, who have closely scrutinized both the accusations and the justification for keeping him in jail.Stephen Givens, an American corporate lawyer in Japan who has been following the case, said the charges hinged on what he called overly technical interpretations of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s and Nissan\u2019s intentions, and whether Nissan had guaranteed that the deferred compensation promised to the auto chief would be paid out.In the case of the alleged transfer of losses, Mr. Givens said, the prosecution appears to be scrutinizing whether a board resolution approving Mr. Ghosn\u2019s transactions was drafted in a sufficiently precise way.\u201cMy God,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether you are in jail or not depends on those two issues?\u201dA bold corporate leader who had celebrity status in Japan for turning Nissan around nearly two decades ago, Mr. Ghosn, a Brazilian-born, Lebanese- and French-educated engineer, presided until recently over a global auto empire selling more than 10 million cars a year.His children have said they believe the accusations are part of a revolt within Nissan against a possible merger with Renault that could give the French manufacturer \u2014 and its largest shareholder, the French government \u2014 a more dominant role in the alliance.On Thursday, Renault said its review of its executives\u2019 compensation for 2017 and 2018 had uncovered no wrongdoing. The company is still reviewing executive pay for previous years, it said in a statement. Mr. Ghosn remains Renault\u2019s chairman and chief executive.In a separate statement, Nissan said its board had \u201cre-emphasized its commitment\u201d to the alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi at a meeting Thursday at Nissan\u2019s headquarters in Yokohama. The automaker also announced a number of interim steps to bolster its corporate governance."}, {"title": "On Politics: White House Digs In on Wall Demands", "category": "Politics", "id": "f1b4d346-b591-4274-973e-d4f782cf4ce4", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/us/politics/on-politics-trump-wall-shutdown.html", "publishdate": 20190111, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Friday morning.

He used the visit to blame the shutdown on Democrats and suggested that he might declare a national emergency to bypass Congress.White House officials considered diverting emergency aid to build a border barrier.

Trump\u2019s management style as a businessman \u2014 impetuous, impolitic, sometimes immature \u2014 worked when he ran his private company, writes the NYT business columnist James Stewart.But now Mr. Trump is running a much larger enterprise, and the management traits that may have propelled him into the White House are not serving him well now that he\u2019s there.With the government shut down over Mr. Trump\u2019s demand for border wall funding, the loss of a Republican majority in the House and scant legislative achievements beyond the 2017 tax cut, Mr. Stewart argues, his presidency is emerging as a case study in how not to govern.ImageJanet Yellen at the American Economic Association meeting.CreditChristopher Aluka Berry/ReutersConfronting #MeToo in economicsSexual harassment, discrimination and bullying are rampant in economics, a field that regularly isolates and dissuades women and minorities and that has only recently begun to address its entrenched culture of exclusion, write Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley of the NYT.The issue arose often last weekend at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Atlanta, they report, where women from Ivy League schools told stories of wearing khakis and loafers to fit in with their male colleagues and new research was released showing that only 10 percent of tenured finance professors are women.Ben Bernanke, the former Fed chairman and the group\u2019s president, said at the event that \u201ceconomics certainly has a problem\u201d and \u201ca reputation for hostility toward women and minorities.\u201d Janet Yellen, who was the Fed\u2019s first chairwoman and will head the association next year, said that dealing with misconduct and discrimination \u201cshould be the highest priority.\u201dLast month, the NYT wrote about harassment accusations against Roland G. Fryer Jr., a prominent Harvard economist, who had been expected join the association\u2019s executive committee this month but was asked to resign.A #MeToo lawsuit: The board of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is being sued in California over the departure of Andy Rubin, a senior executive known as the \u201cfather of Android.\u201d The shareholder lawsuit alleges that directors knew about an investigation into a sexual harassment claim against Mr. Rubin but nevertheless played an \u201cactive and direct role\u201d in approving a $90 million severance package for him. The NYT reported in October that Google made the payout after a female employee accused Mr. Rubin of coercing her into performing oral sex.China trade talks head for WashingtonNegotiations between China and the U.S. are advancing, with China\u2019s vice premier and economic chief, Liu He, heading to Washington on Jan. 30 and 31. He will meet with the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, according to the WSJ.The next-level gathering, unless it is stymied by the government shutdown, will continue three days of midlevel discussions in Beijing that wrapped up on Wednesday with a sense of progress but few specific resolutions.This fight does have some winners: Tariffs on Chinese and American cars could bolster automakers in Japan. Restrictions on American soybeans could help farmers in Brazil and Canada.But investors want resolution. The standoff has shaken global markets, and signs of optimism from negotiators lifted stocks this week. Today in Asia, the Hang Seng, Nikkei, Kospi and Shanghai Composite indexes all closed higher.Espionage in China: A Chinese employee of Huawei and a Polish employee of the French telecommunications company Orange have been arrested in Poland, charged with spying for the Chinese government.Patience is the Fed\u2019s new watchwordJerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the central bank would evaluate the health of the economy before any further interest rate increases, using the word \u201cpatience\u201d four times in his remarks. Financial markets have shown signs of anxiety about the economic outlook, but Mr. Powell said 2018 was \u201ca very good year for the economy.\u201d The Fed, he said, saw signs of continued momentum.In other Fed news: Most private economists expect it to hold interest rates steady at least until June, according to a WSJ survey. Last summer, the Fed\u2019s policy of quantitative tightening was expected to lift bond yields, but in the topsy-turvy world of Wall Street, the reaction has reversed in just a few months.Earnings season is looking uglyThe forecast on Wall Street calls for plenty of pessimism, as a slew of companies slashed their financial predictions and announced cost-cutting measures yesterday:\u2022 American Airlines said a measure of fourth-quarter revenue would gain just 1.5 percent, after previously promising as much as 3.5 percent. Delta, which will report its earnings on Tuesday, made a similar announcement earlier this month.\u2022 Ford said it would cut thousands of jobs in Europe, as it faces declining demand and increasingly stringent emissions rules. Jaguar Land Rover said it was cutting 4,500 jobs because of \u201cmultiple geopolitical and regulatory disruptions.\u201d\u2022 BlackRock, which will report its earnings on Wednesday, will show 500 employees the door in the next few weeks. The world\u2019s largest asset manager blamed \u201cmarket uncertainty.\u201d\u2022 Macy\u2019s suffered the biggest single-day sell-off in its history after scaling back its sales and earnings guidance.\u2022 Holiday sales at Kohl\u2019s were disappointing, rising 1.2 percent last year from the year before, compared with a nearly 7 percent boost in 2017. Barnes & Noble said it might slash its outlook by as much as 10 percent because of higher spending on advertising and promotions.\u2022 Bed Bath & Beyond was one of the few bright spots, saying it was ahead of some of its financial goals.Many more businesses are scheduled to report results next week, with JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo earnings coming on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America on Wednesday, and Netflix and Morgan Stanley on Thursday.But how long will it take the market react to the secrets likely buried in the \u201cdreary and repetitious\u201d prose that makes earning reports so \u201cmind-numbingly boring\u201d?

And it wants them (and only them \u2014 got that, teens?) to try vaping instead.\u201cFor smokers. By design,\u201d blares the company\u2019s website. A new $10 million TV ad campaign, called \u201cMake the Switch,\u201d echoes that theme, featuring testimonials from ex-smokers, all comfortably above the legal smoking age, who have swapped their cigarettes for a Juul.This benevolent-sounding mission \u2014 helping nicotine-addicted adult smokers switch to something far less likely to kill them \u2014 is Juul\u2019s new pitch, and the way it hopes to rehabilitate its image as one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most problematic start-ups.ImageJuul\u2019s new commercials feature testimonials from former smokers.ImageYou can\u2019t fault Juul for trying. The company, which is valued at $38 billion, has been through the wringer lately, with regulators, public health advocates and concerned parents accusing it of fueling an epidemic of teenage nicotine addiction by marketing to young people with fruit-flavored pods, colorful youth-filled ads and social media campaigns. It has been sued by users and lambasted by lawmakers, and the Food and Drug Administration, which is investigating whether Juul\u2019s marketing practices deliberately targeted underage users, conducted a surprise inspection of the company\u2019s headquarters last year. (In November, Juul announced it would shut down its Instagram and Facebook accounts, and stop selling most flavored pods in stores.)ImageThe ads are part of a $10 million campaign.ImageAdding to the concern is that last month, Juul took a $12.8 billion investment from Altria, the tobacco giant behind Marlboro and other popular brands, in exchange for 35 percent of the company.Now, after making billions of dollars and joining forces with Big Tobacco, Juul is billing itself as a public-health crusader.Juul is far from the first company to attempt a humanitarian makeover. Facebook, an outgrowth of a Harvard student\u2019s juvenile attempt to quantify the attractiveness of his classmates, now claims to have been motivated by a virtuous impulse to connect the world; Uber, created by two tech entrepreneurs who wanted to zoom around San Francisco in luxury cars, later tried to convince people that it wanted to provide affordable mobility to the masses.But in Juul\u2019s case, revisionist history is particularly important, because the way Juul markets itself is central to the question of how it should be treated. Many consumers, investors and ethical technologists would rightly shun a company that knowingly targeted minors with harmful products, and cleaned up its act only after public pressure. But if you believe that Juul had a noble anti-cigarette mission all along, it\u2019s easier to excuse its missteps as the product of innocent na\u00efvet\u00e9.Unfortunately for Juul, plenty of evidence suggests that the company didn\u2019t always take its public health agenda so seriously.In 2015, in an interview with The Verge, Ari Atkins, a research and development engineer who helped create the original Juul, said that \u201cwe don\u2019t think a lot about addiction here because we\u2019re not trying to design a cessation product at all.\u201dHe added that \u201canything about health is not on our mind.\u201dIn other early interviews, James Monsees, Juul\u2019s co-founder and chief product officer, played down the idea of a public health mission.\u201cWe\u2019re not an activist company,\u201d he said in a 2014 interview. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like what we\u2019re making better than cigarettes, then have a cigarette, that\u2019s fine.\u201dIn an interview the next year, Mr. Monsees called Juul\u2019s predecessor, a tobacco vaporizer known as Pax, \u201cthe dystopian future of tobacco,\u201d and said the company\u2019s vaporizing technology might someday find a market beyond cigarette smokers.In a statement this week, Mr. Monsees said the company had been forced to be careful about its marketing. Under federal regulations, the company is allowed to bill its device as a \u201cswitching product\u201d for smokers, but not as a smoking cessation tool or a health device. He said that while Juul \u201cinitiated campaigns in the past that we would not do today,\u201d it was always focused on eliminating cigarettes.ImageJames Monsees, a Juul co-founder, said that although the company \u201cinitiated campaigns in the past that we would not do today,\u201d it was always focused on eliminating cigarettes.CreditSeth Wenig/Associated Press\u201cSince 2005, we have been focused on creating a product to help people switch away from smoking combustible cigarettes \u2014 the number one cause of preventable death in the world,\u201d Mr. Monsees said. \u201cThat focus has been clear in the key milestone moments in the creation of the company \u2014 it is what we said in our 2005 Stanford graduation thesis and our first fund-raising letter in 2007.\u201dJuul\u2019s founders did, in fact, talk about improving health as a motivating factor early in the company\u2019s existence. In a 2007 email sent to potential investors, Adam Bowen, Juul\u2019s other co-founder, mentioned wanting to \u201coffer a new alternative for health-conscious smokers.\u201d The pair\u2019s graduate thesis presentation, delivered while they were studying at Stanford in 2005, pitches vaping as a healthier substitute for cigarettes.But Juul\u2019s public marketing told a different story. Few of the company\u2019s early ads made any mention of cigarettes\u2019 risks, or advocated for smokers to switch; most were focused on playing up vaping\u2019s cool factor. As recently as 2017, the front page of the company\u2019s website said nothing about switching from cigarettes at all, only that the Juul offered an \u201cintensely satisfying vapor experience.\u201dRecently, Juul \u2014 now equipped with an army of lobbyists and a slick communications team that includes a former White House spokesman \u2014 has studiously revamped its image. Glossy profiles have been written about the company\u2019s \u201clifesaving mission\u201d and Juul\u2019s new chief executive, Kevin Burns, has gotten on message, emphasizing the company\u2019s focus on adult smokers.This abrupt about-face has drawn skepticism from critics. Matthew L. Myers, the president of the antismoking advocacy group Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, characterized Juul\u2019s new ad campaign as little more than a P.R. effort aimed at lawmakers and regulators.\u201cJuul has engaged in all the traditional tactics of a company that is trying to fend off meaningful regulation, rather than actually change their behavior,\u201d Mr. Myers said. \u201cThat is classic Big Tobacco.\u201dFor all the hand-wringing, no one is suggesting that Juul\u2019s nicotine pods are less healthy than cigarettes, or that the company should stop marketing itself as a smoking alternative. There\u2019s every reason to believe that vaping is significantly less harmful than smoking, and many adult smokers have in fact used Juul\u2019s products to help them quit.But motives matter. And Juul\u2019s shifty self-presentation suggests that the company may not be acting entirely on the level.Juul wants you to believe that it became a teenage sensation entirely by accident, that its products were only ever meant for adult smokers and that taking billions of dollars from Big Tobacco is consistent with the values of a company that has always put a priority on health over profits.The truth is much hazier than that."}, {"title": "U.K. Businesses Sound the Alarm While Planning for a No-Deal Brexit", "category": "Business", "id": "0fb93c32-ccea-4fca-9ddc-27400a0a684b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/business/no-deal-brexit-business.html", "publishdate": 20190111, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/12/business/12brexit/12brexit-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LONDON \u2014 Some car manufacturers will idle their factories. The police are advising store owners to hire more security guards. Trucks have been sent to the coast to practice with artificial traffic jams. And exasperated business lobbyists are warning of supply-chain calamities.Britain remains politically paralyzed ahead of a contentious vote in Parliament next week on a plan to withdraw from the European Union, or Brexit. But businesses are plowing ahead and preparing for the possibility that the country crashes out of the bloc without an agreement at the end of March \u2014 a no-deal Brexit.Honda, the Japanese auto company, which produces about 150,000 cars a year in its factory in Swindon, in southwest England, said on Friday that it would stop production for six days in April to assess its supply chain and possible disruptions from border delays after Brexit. The company said its 4,000 employees would go to work but would be training or handling maintenance.BMW has already said it will shut its Mini factory in Oxford for maintenance for a month beginning April 1, in case a no-deal outcome disrupts its production.Honda was the most high-profile company to make its Brexit contingency plans known this week, and a diplomatic visit prompted the revelation. Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s prime minister, flew to London to meet with Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday and emphasized that he hoped a no-deal Brexit could be avoided.Other Japanese companies, too, are not waiting for reassurance. \u201cThere are preparations underway,\u201d Koji Tsuruoka, Japan\u2019s ambassador to Britain, told the BBC on Friday, adding that Japanese companies were prepared for \u201call contingencies.\u201dIf Britain leaves the European Union with no deal, it could wreak havoc on just-in-time manufacturing that relies on goods crossing the British border from France and arriving at factories within minutes of final assembly.\u201cThat\u2019s the system that makes them survive in this very competitive environment,\u201d Mr. Tsuruoka said of companies' manufacturing processes. \u201cIf that is no longer available, then of course they have to think twice as to how do they continue to be operative in this environment.\u201dRetail businesses were also being advised to prepare for uncertain times. On Friday, the Metropolitan Police said they were advising stores to consider hiring extra security just in case shortages created by a no-deal exit prompted a rush of shoppers.\u201cWe are having these conversations in order to minimize the demands on policing from any resulting large crowds or queues at shops and as part of our regular civil contingency engagement with businesses and partners,\u201d the police said in an emailed statement.Although businesses have been wary of wading into the politics of Brexit, some are now more willing to declare that a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous.The Confederation of British Industry warned on Friday that the government needed to be as specific as possible about how it would avoid a no-deal outcome.\u201cMake no mistake, no-deal cannot be \u2018managed,\u2019\u201d Carolyn Fairbairn, the group\u2019s director-general, said in a speech. \u201cAnd it\u2019s certainly not desirable.\u201dIn what proved to be a less-than-convincing effort to ease public anxiety, the British government conducted an exercise on Monday to test how it would manage disruption at the border. It offered truck companies about $700 a truck to gather vehicles at Marston Airport, 20 miles west of the port of Dover, so it could test how effectively traffic backups could be managed if vehicles coming off ferries from Europe had to stop for customs checks.Only 89 trucks turned up, compared with the 150 expected, and the operation was widely mocked as \u201cwindow dressing.\u201dRadio and television news broadcasts this week were studded with commentary from people exasperated with the waiting game.\u201cThe only lobbying taking place now is through the airwaves to make it very clear to the politicians and the government that they have to sort this out,\u201d said Iain Anderson, the executive chairman at Cicero, a consulting firm. \u201cThe longer this Brexit political drama continues, the less and less attractive the U.K. is going to be\u201d to investors.Still, the vote in Parliament on the exit deal \u2014 set for Tuesday and anticipated to face strong opposition \u2014 is likely to offer some respite for businesses desperate for some clarity. Debate surrounding the vote will better define what politicians want and what the prime minister can take back for further negotiations with European officials.\u201cThere will be some signposts for business that will give them some small degree of confidence,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director, Europe, for the Eurasia Group. \u201cThere will be uncertainty, there\u2019s still a lot of downside risk, but that\u2019s inherent to Brexit, and it will remain inherent until a withdrawal agreement is ratified.\u201d"}, {"title": "The Week in Tech: It\u2019s Not Easy Being a Unicorn", "category": "Business", "id": "2e1dea44-c8ed-4c23-9f05-94c22a20b026", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/technology/the-week-in-tech-its-not-easy-being-a-unicorn.html", "publishdate": 20190111, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/12/business/12technewsletter01/merlin_141019602_a0f1088c-f749-4fc8-9766-d21fe0f760e8-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Hello, It\u2019s Erin Griffith, reporting, happily, from my home base in San Francisco and not the carnival of virtual assistants, shiny screens, crowded smart homes and greasy VR demos in Las Vegas. Our correspondents made the CES maze of gadgets look almost fun, which anyone who has been there before knows is an impressive feat.Back in the land of magical, billion-dollar start-up unicorns, things have been quieter, thanks to the federal government shutdown. No Securities and Exchange Commission means no progress on initial public offering plans of the larger start-ups, including Uber and Lyft.Any other time in the last five years, this would not have mattered. The unicorns have been putting off their public market debuts for as long as possible \u2014 what\u2019s another month or two? But a volatile stock market and signs of a possible recession have fostered a creeping sense of panic.As The Times reported in December, Uber and Lyft already accelerated their I.P.O. plans to try to get ahead of a potential market shift. This week, Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive of Uber, tempered expectations, telling The Wall Street Journal that market turbulence was not likely to affect the company\u2019s plans, but \u201cif it doesn\u2019t happen, it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201dUber shareholders would most likely be disappointed if the company does not go public in the coming year, he added.The shutdown, volatility and recession fears are happening at a crucial moment. The start-up world\u2019s success hinges, in part, on its ability to use hype and \u201ctrust me\u201d confidence to persuade people to believe in a vision of the future. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the narrative of innovation, disruption and rising valuations (and ignore the lack of profits).But not everyone has, and skeptics are getting louder. Chamath Palihapitiya, a prominent venture capital investor, recently called the entire start-up and venture capital system a \u201ccharade\u201d and \u201can enormous multivariate kind of Ponzi scheme.\u201dHe\u2019s right in one sense: A Ponzi scheme relies on its creator\u2019s ability to persuade ever-larger crowds to buy into his or her vision. Same goes for start-ups that haven\u2019t proved they\u2019re able to turn a profit. A flash of doubt, especially among public-market investors, could spiral into a broader questioning of the entire start-up ecosystem.For the largest, most valuable start-ups in Silicon Valley, many of which plan to prove themselves and their unprofitable business models to the world by going public, there could not be a worse moment for that to happen. If Uber can\u2019t go public, what does it mean for all the \u201cUber for X\u201d companies that followed its lead?Cracks are beginning to show. This week, two high-flying start-ups experienced a reality check in their fund-raising. WeWork sought to raise $16 billion in new funding from SoftBank, its main backer. The company wound up raising just $2 billion \u2014 still an enormous pile of cash, but a steep step down from its original plan.And Bird, a two-year-old scooter company that was so sought-after by investors last summer that they doubled the company\u2019s valuation in just a few weeks, is now raising funding at a flat valuation, according to Axios.Some venture capital investors say they welcome a downturn, as I wrote this week. They\u2019re hoarding cash and making \u201cdownturn lists\u201d of companies to invest in once valuations become more reasonable. And some companies have seen the venture-fueled madness and decided it\u2019s not for them.Elsewhere this week:\u25a0 Economists and investors are clashing over the health of the American economy. No one is debating the health of the Chinese economy, with concerns spreading to non-tech companies including Ford, FedEx, Starbucks and Tiffany, Matt Phillips writes.\u25a0 Apple\u2019s biggest issue is not the Chinese economy, it\u2019s that people like the columnist Kevin Roose\u2019s mother don\u2019t feel the need to replace their phones every two years anymore.\u25a0 That may explain the surprising news from CES that Apple struck deals with a number of hardware companies, including Vizio, Samsung, Sony and LG, to use its software. The deals \u2014 something the company has resisted in the past \u2014 show Apple\u2019s ambition to make more money from content and services, as sales of its cash cow, the iPhone, slow down, Brian X.

It was unclear whether the arrests in Poland had been requested by the United States. But a senior Western diplomat who was briefed on them said the Justice Department had been working with the Polish government.Europe is increasingly a battleground in the fight over Huawei, the world\u2019s second-largest smartphone maker and a top supplier of networking equipment. The company\u2019s sales in the region have been growing, but many countries there now face pressure to reconsider its presence, particularly as construction begins for the next-generation wireless networks known as 5G. Germany, Britain, the Czech Republic and Norway are among the nations that have recently questioned how deeply Huawei should be involved in developing 5G infrastructure.Many of the countries adopting this stance are allies of the United States. Poland, specifically, is regarded by the State Department as \u201cone of the United States\u2019 strongest partners\u201d in continental Europe. And Andrus Ansip, the European Union\u2019s vice president, said last month that countries in the region should be \u201cworried\u201d about Huawei and other Chinese companies because of the cybersecurity risks they pose.Other countries face the same dilemma. In December, Japan barred Huawei from obtaining government contracts, and Australia and New Zealand have taken steps to block the company from being involved in the building of 5G networks in those countries. And the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency recently restated its long-standing warnings about Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecommunications company.\u201cPicking sides may be unavoidable,\u201d said Lukasz Olejnik, a research associate at the Center for Technology and Global Affairs at Oxford University, which studies the impact of technology on international relations. \u201cThis is a difficult policy conundrum.\u201dHuawei has long denied spying for the Chinese government. On Friday, a spokesman for the company said it had no comment on the arrest in Poland and insisted that it \u201ccomplies with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries where it operates.\u201dThe second person arrested is an employee of the French telecommunications company Orange, which confirmed that its office had been raided and that the man\u2019s belongings had been seized.\u201cWe are ready to cooperate with the Internal Security Agency and make any information it needs available,\u201d the Orange spokesman, Wojciech Jabczynski, said.Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of Global Times, a state-run, nationalist newspaper in China, took a swipe at Poland on Twitter on Friday, writing: \u201cAnything in Poland that is worthy of stealing for Huawei? Polish national security department flatters itself.\u201dIn another message, he said he had met up with a friend who works at Huawei. \u201cHe said Huawei is facing great difficulties communicating with Western public opinion,\u201d Mr. Hu wrote. \u201cI said Huawei has been trying to distance itself from politics, but it has grown too big that politics is coming to its door. Huawei is innocent.\u201dThe arrested Huawei employee was identified by the authorities only as Weijing W. He was involved in the company\u2019s sales operations in the country, officials said. According to Polish television, Weijing W. graduated from Beijing Foreign Studies University with a degree in Polish studies and once worked at the Chinese Consulate in Gdansk, Poland. He began working for Huawei in 2011.The Orange employee was identified as Piotr D., a Polish citizen and former agent of Poland\u2019s internal security service.Polish law enforcement officers raided the homes and offices of the two men on Tuesday, officials said. The authorities then had to wait two days to obtain arrest warrants, typical for Poland. Officials did not offer details on the alleged crimes, but said the men would be held for three months while the investigation continued. Both have pleaded not guilty and have refused to answer questions, the Polish state television broadcaster, TVP, reported.The senior Western diplomat briefed on the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, would not describe the level of cooperation between Poland and the United States. The official also declined to discuss specifics of the case or evidence that may have been shared with the Polish government.But the official said the threat posed by Huawei was a high priority for American officials throughout Europe.Huawei was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former People\u2019s Liberation Army engineer. The company\u2019s equipment is the backbone of mobile networks around the world, and its smartphones are popular in Europe and China. Huawei has grown into China\u2019s largest maker of telecom equipment, generating more than $90 billion in revenue in 2017.The company has been a leading contender to design 5G networks in Europe and other parts of the world, but the security concerns of Western countries have repeatedly hampered its expansion plans. In a 2012 report, American lawmakers said Huawei and ZTE were effectively arms of the Chinese government whose equipment was being used for espionage. Security firms have reported finding software installed on Chinese-made phones that sends users\u2019 personal data to China.For many years, the United States, where large mobile carriers such as AT&T have avoided using Huawei equipment in their networks, has presented the biggest obstacles to the company.Last year, United States intelligence agencies told a Senate panel that Americans should not use Chinese telecom products, and some major American retailers have stopped selling them. The Federal Communications Commission is also considering whether to prohibit American telecom businesses from using equipment from any company deemed a national security risk, a move aimed primarily at Huawei and ZTE that would effectively shut them out of creating 5G mobile networks.Huawei has focused on Europe instead, opening several research and development hubs in the region. More than a quarter of its 2017 revenue came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Only the Chinese market is more important to the company.Telecommunication companies in Europe have strong relationships with Huawei. Deutsche Telekom said in December that it had begun testing a 5G network in Poland using Huawei equipment. Mr. Jabczynski, the Orange spokesman, said Huawei was the only company in Poland ready to provide equipment that met criteria set by state regulations.Huawei also has around a quarter of the market for smartphones in Poland, according to the technology research firm Canalys. That makes it the country\u2019s second-largest phone seller after Samsung.But the challenges facing Huawei in Europe are mounting.British officials raised alarms about the company\u2019s products last year. The Czech Republic\u2019s cybersecurity watchdog has warned against using Huawei and ZTE products. And just this week, Tor Mikkel Wara, Norway\u2019s justice minister, told Reuters that \u201cwe share the same concerns as the United States and Britain, and that is espionage on private and state actors in Norway.\u201dIn Poland, at least one of the country\u2019s main mobile carriers has been edging away from the company. The carrier, Play, has long relied on the company as an equipment supplier. And China Development Bank, a state-backed lender, has helped finance Play\u2019s buying of Huawei equipment, according to the website of Lasanoz Finance, an advisory firm that says it worked on the deal. When Play listed its shares on the Warsaw stock exchange in 2017, it said Huawei had provided a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of the equipment on its network.But last July, as concerns about Chinese hardware grew, Play announced that it had chosen Ericsson as an additional supplier for certain components.The arrests in Poland promised to generate more concerns about the company, said David Balson, a former official in the British intelligence agency GCHQ who is now the director of intelligence at Ripjar, a threat detection company in London.\u201cThere is no good outcome whether it\u2019s true or not true,\u201d Mr. Balson said. \u201cThere is no good way of spinning it.\u201dPoland and other countries that crack down on Huawei risk retaliation from China. Shortly after the Canadian authorities arrested Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Mr. Ren, the Huawei founder, China detained two Canadian citizens last month and accused them of undermining China\u2019s national security. China has since detained other Canadians.Ms. Meng has been freed on bail in Vancouver, British Columbia, pending a decision on whether she should be extradited to the United States.

Ms. Kelly was part of the team at the House committee that helped the party capture the majority in 2018, overseeing the group\u2019s media strategy during the midterm elections.Emmy Bengtson, the former digital director for Gov. Gavin Newsom of California in his 2018 race, has signed on as Ms. Kelly\u2019s deputy, overseeing the campaign\u2019s digital operation. And Dan McNally, a former political director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, is expected to become a senior adviser with the title of campaign director.The hiring is part of a flurry of activity by Ms. Gillibrand in recent weeks as the 2020 campaign gets underway. Politico reported on Thursday night that she is preparing a trip to Iowa later this month, and also first reported that Mr. McNally was joining the campaign.Glen Caplin, a spokesman for Ms. Gillibrand, declined to comment.Taking the step of actually retaining new staff \u2014 rather than merely conducting interviews or planning out staff recruitment \u2014 indicates that Ms. Gillibrand is probably in the very last stages of preparing for the 2020 race. Once politicians raise or spend more than $5,000 on their candidacy, they have just 15 days to file paperwork forming a campaign with the Federal Election Commission.Depending on when she announces her decision, Ms. Gillibrand, 52, could become the second high-profile Democrat to join the race, after Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Ms. Gillibrand has signaled that she will run as a progressive and has been an especially forceful advocate within the party on matters of gender equality.At least two other senators, Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, are expected to announce in the coming weeks, joining a field that could grow to dozens. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, has also told associates he intends to make a decision this month and has been leaning toward running.While she has a high profile in the news media, Ms. Gillibrand is not well known among Democratic voters nationally. In a Quinnipiac University poll last month, 64 percent of Democrats said they did not yet know enough about her to form an opinion.As a senator, Ms. Gillibrand has relied on a tightly knit team of advisers who have counseled her for years, helping her navigate her appointment to the Senate in 2009, a special election to defend the seat in 2010 and a regularly scheduled Senate election in 2012. But she has been moving aggressively to add to her staff and compete with other Democratic contenders for prized talent in the party.Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s expanded political team arose from that process. Before joining the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Ms. Kelly worked as a spokeswoman for Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the current Senate minority leader.Ms. Bengtson worked on digital communications for Planned Parenthood and President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012. Mr. McNally was the campaign manager for Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, one of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s colleagues who has also said he is considering a run for president."}, {"title": "On Politics: The Biggest Stories of the Week", "category": "Politics", "id": "d3a4746a-b97d-4fbb-9fb5-9e07cf99d6d1", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/us/politics/on-politics-the-biggest-stories-of-the-week.html", "publishdate": 20190112, "imageurl": "", "content": "From the ongoing government shutdown to foreign policy changes in the Middle East, it\u2019s been a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you\u2019d like to read further).___________________The shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history.The partial government shutdown has entered its 22nd day, making it the longest in American history.Privately, many Republicans say the stalemate over the border wall has been made exponentially worse by White House ineptitude on Capitol Hill. On Friday, the president stepped back from declaring a national emergency under pressure from congressional Republicans, but there is still no end in sight.On Tuesday night, President Trump used his first prime-time Oval Office address \u2014 one that was filled with misleading assertions \u2014 to pressure Congress into paying for his long-promised border wall.A day after storming out of a meeting in the White House with congressional leaders, Mr. Trump traveled to the southern border on Thursday to bolster his case for a wall, and he canceled his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.As effects of the shutdown pile up, more Americans are feeling the bite. The nation\u2019s air travel system could be at risk; farmers that stood with Mr. Trump during the election are at a breaking point; and 800,000 federal employees still haven\u2019t received a paycheck.Additional Reading\u2022  A Shut Down Government Actually Costs More Than an Open One\u2022 The Many Ways Trump Has Said Mexico Will Pay for the Wall\u2022  On the Border, Little Enthusiasm for a Wall: \u2018We Have Other Problems That Need Fixing\u2019\u2022  Before Trump, Steve King Set the Agenda for the Wall and Anti-Immigrant PoliticsMore revelations about Trump and Russia.In the days after President Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, law enforcement officials became so concerned by the president\u2019s behavior that they began investigating whether he had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests, The Times reported on Friday.More connections between Mr. Trump\u2019s circle and Russian officials came to light this week. A formatting error by Paul Manafort\u2019s lawyer revealed that Mr. Manafort, a former manager of the Trump campaign, shared polling data with a man tied to Russian intelligence.House Democrats summoned Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, for a classified briefing about the government\u2019s plans to end sanctions on companies linked to a Russian oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska. Mr. Mnuchin told lawmakers that the White House played no formal role in the decision, and he said later that he would consider delaying the lifting of the sanctions so skeptics in Congress could have more time to review it.Additional Reading\u2022 Prosecutors Examining Ukrainians Who Flocked to Trump Inaugural\u2022  Supreme Court Stays Out of Secret Case That May Be Part of Mueller Probe\u2022 Democrats Start Investigative Gears, but SlowlyConfusion over the Syria withdrawal plan.President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, appeared to roll back Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to rapidly withdraw from Syria on Sunday, laying out conditions for a pullout that could leave American forces there for months or even years. Mr. Bolton \u2014 who found himself scrambling after Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement \u2014 is at least partly responsible for the conditions that led to the president\u2019s sudden move.The president\u2019s withdrawal plan fell into further disarray on Tuesday after Turkey\u2019s leader rebuffed Mr. Bolton, angrily dismissing his demand that Turkey agree to protect America\u2019s Kurdish allies.Regardless of the turmoil, the American military began withdrawing some equipment (but no troops yet) from Syria on Friday.Additional Reading\u2022 Pompeo Speech Lays Out Vision for Mideast, Taking Shots at Obama\u2022 Trump and Pompeo Embrace Autocrats and Disparage Opponents at Home\u2022  As U.S. Exits Syria, Mideast Faces a Post-American EraHere\u2019s what else happened this week:\u2022 Michael D.

But according to two people familiar with the negotiations, Ms. Kelly was paid the outstanding balance on her contract, a figure that amounts to roughly $30 million. At the time of the separation, Ms. Kelly was in the middle of a three-year, $69 million contract with the network.\u201cThe parties have resolved their differences, and Megyn Kelly is no longer an employee of NBC,\u201d NBC News said in a statement Friday night.Ms. Kelly last appeared on NBC on Oct. 24, when she apologized for her remarks at the start of \u201cMegyn Kelly Today,\u201d as the 9 a.m. block of the \u201cToday\u201d show was called during her 13 months on the program.In the 11 weeks since, while a lawyer working on her behalf and NBC negotiated the terms of her exit, she earned roughly $5 million. The ratings for the third hour of \u201cToday\u201d have improved during her absence, rising to roughly 2.9 million viewers, from an average of 2.4 million, according to Nielsen.[The many times Megyn Kelly became the story.]NBC hired Ms. Kelly away from Fox News two years ago. She drew big ratings at the conservative cable network, a key component of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire, as a sometimes prosecutorial prime-time host and achieved wider recognition during the 2016 presidential campaign.After making the move, Ms. Kelly, 48, was on a path to becoming a face of NBC. In addition to giving her a prominent slot on the \u201cToday\u201d show, the network made her the host of a new Sunday night news program. The plan also called for her to cover breaking news, politics and special events. But her time at NBC, which began on May 1, 2017, was bumpy from the start.On \u201cSunday Night With Megyn Kelly,\u201d a show meant to challenge CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Ms. Kelly faced off against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in an interview that was widely criticized. And she became the scourge of parents of children murdered in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings when she interviewed the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who had falsely claimed the killings were a hoax.When the time came for her to join \u201cToday\u201d in September 2017, she sometimes seemed out of her element in the lighter and brighter realm of morning television.The network had revamped Studio 6A at its 30 Rockefeller Plaza headquarters, installing roughly 100 seats so that \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d would have its own cheering squad. But with sharp questions and comments, Ms. Kelly offended celebrity guests like Debra Messing and Jane Fonda. Of more importance to network executives, she delivered middling ratings.By the time one of NBC\u2019s biggest events came around \u2014 the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea \u2014 Ms. Kelly was not among the correspondents sent to cover it.In May 2018, during the network\u2019s annual presentation to advertisers known as the upfronts, there was another sign that her stock was down at NBC. From the Radio City Music Hall stage, the late-night host Seth Meyers mentioned the network\u2019s broadcast of \u201cJesus Christ Superstar,\u201d with John Legend in the lead role, before remarking: \u201cYou know a network has some range when they have a black Jesus and Megyn Kelly.\u201d The joke was a reference Ms. Kelly\u2019s much-criticized statements, made during a 2013 segment on Fox News, that Santa Claus and Jesus were white.And then came the Oct. 23, 2018, episode of \u201cMegyn Kelly Today.\u201d\u2018I\u2019m a Little Fired Up\u2019Ms. Kelly opened the show by announcing: \u201cI have to give you a fair warning. I\u2019m a little fired up over Halloween costumes this morning.\u201dWhat followed was a segment out of the Fox News playbook: a round-table discussion of how multiculturalism was supposedly affecting the celebration of a national holiday.\u201cBut what is racist?\u201d Ms. Kelly said. \u201cYou do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface on Halloween, or a black person who puts on whiteface for Halloween. Back when I was a kid, that was O.K., as long as you were dressing up as a character.\u201dThose remarks were the last straw for NBC.Ms. Kelly offered an on-air apology the next morning. She also hosted a segment featuring two black panelists, Roland Martin and Amy Holmes, who explained the history of blackface, a demeaning practice with a history going back to 19th-century minstrel shows.By that time, Ms. Kelly no longer had the support of the network or her fellow \u201cToday\u201d hosts, with her colleagues Al Roker and Craig Melvin having criticized her on the air earlier that morning. At a staff meeting hours later, Andrew Lack, the chairman of NBC News, condemned Ms. Kelly\u2019s remarks and made no mention of her apology.A number of guests scheduled for episodes of \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d \u2014 as varied as the director Ron Howard and a Bergen County, N.J., medium named Craig McManus \u2014 pulled out of their appearances. NBC canceled \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d on Oct. 26.Since going off the air, Ms. Kelly has come to the conclusion that her \u201cblackface\u201d comments were used as a pretext to get rid of her, according to a person familiar with her thinking. She has also kept up a social media presence, posting on her Twitter account a Politico column that defended the Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson from an advertising boycott.\u201cToday\u201d moved on without her. On Monday, a \u201cToday\u201d meteorologist, Dylan Dreyer, announced she would be a regular host of the third hour alongside Mr. Melvin, Mr. Roker and Sheinelle Jones. In the time since Ms. Kelly has been off the air, viewership totals for the hour have gone up 18 percent. Ms. Kelly\u2019s former home, Studio 6A, has gone dark.Gossip and GritMs. Kelly grew up near Albany and worked as a corporate lawyer in Chicago before zeroing in on television. On a 2015 episode of her Fox News show, \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d she told the story of her career switch to her guest, Dr. Phil McGraw, the television host.As she explained it, she was watching him on an episode of \u201cOprah\u201d in the early 2000s when she heard him say something that struck her: \u201cThe only difference between you and someone you envy is that you settle for less.\u201d She left the law firm for an on-air job at an ABC affiliate. Not long after that, she joined Fox News, where she worked for 12 years.She took over a prime-time slot in 2013 and drew significant media attention during the last presidential campaign, when Donald J. Trump criticized her harshly after she was an unflinching moderator of a primary-season debate. In 2016, she published a best-selling memoir with a title that had its origins in the words Dr. Phil had spoken to Oprah: \u201cSettle for More.\u201dWith her Fox News contract set to expire in 2017, NBC was one of several suitors. After signing the multiyear deal with the network, Ms. Kelly said a morning slot would give her the chance to host a \u201cfun and uplifting\u201d show, while also allowing her to have dinner with her children. As it evolved, however, \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d was a stew of celebrity gossip, gritty crime stories, sexual misconduct discussions and cooking segments.The network television audience at that hour is more diverse than Fox News\u2019s older, largely white viewership. And Ms. Kelly had trouble finding a sizable constituency among \u201cToday\u201d devotees.When NBC executives and Ms. Kelly\u2019s lawyer started negotiating her departure, the man who had inspired her to go into television \u2014 Dr. Phil \u2014 signed a new deal with CBS Television Distribution that would keep him on the air through at least 2023."}, {"title": "Juli\u00e1n Castro, Former Housing Secretary, Announces 2020 Presidential Run", "category": "Politics", "id": "36354b2d-c253-4b1a-bb3c-4896c591174c", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/us/politics/julian-castro-president-announce.html", "publishdate": 20190112, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/13/us/13CASTRO-p1/13CASTRO-1-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary and former mayor of San Antonio, announced on Saturday that he would run for president, one of the most high-profile Latino Democrats ever to seek the party\u2019s nomination.His first campaign stop will be in Puerto Rico, where he will speak on Monday at the Latino Victory Fund\u2019s annual summit and meet with residents still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria. Later in the week, his campaign said, he will go to New Hampshire.\u201cWhen my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago,\u201d Mr. Castro said at the Plaza Guadalupe amphitheater in San Antonio, in the neighborhood where he was raised. \u201cI\u2019m sure that she never could have imagined that just two generations later, one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the United States Congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words: I am a candidate for president of the United States of America.\u201dMr. Castro\u2019s announcement had been expected for several weeks. He established an exploratory committee in December, two months after publishing a memoir, \u201cAn Unlikely Journey\u201d \u2014 a familiar path for presidential candidates who want to play up their life stories and qualifications and, perhaps, get ahead of their biggest vulnerabilities. This month he also visited two of the early caucus and primary states, Iowa and Nevada.He joins Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former State Senator Richard Ojeda of West Virginia and former Representative John Delaney of Maryland on the list of Democrats who have said definitively that they will seek for the party\u2019s 2020 nomination. That list is expected to grow considerably in the coming weeks and months.In his speech on Saturday, Mr. Castro emphasized education, calling for a national version of the prekindergarten program he established in San Antonio when he was mayor. To fund the program there, he increased the city\u2019s sales tax \u2014 a politically risky proposition, especially in Texas, but San Antonio voters approved it.His message was firmly progressive. He called for a higher minimum wage, denounced police killings of African-Americans, which he described as \u201cstate violence,\u201d and embraced the Black Lives Matter movement. He also condemned President Trump\u2019s immigration policy, including the practice of family separation and the proposed border wall, and declared that his first executive order if elected would be to rejoin the Paris climate accords, which Mr. Trump left.George Rodriguez, a conservative blogger, talk-show host and Fox News contributor whom Texas Republican leaders designated as their spokesman on the announcement, said after the speech that the discussion of immigration had stood out to him. Mr. Castro, he said, did not \u201cseem to be able to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration.\u201dImageMr. Castro has brushed off concerns that he is not as experienced or as well known as many of the other likely candidates.CreditIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York TimesMr. Rodriguez also argued that the San Antonio pre-K program, which was one of Mr. Castro\u2019s chief accomplishments as mayor, had duplicated existing programs like Head Start. \u201cHow much of an accomplishment that is is rather dubious,\u201d he said.[Read about what Mr. Castro and the other early entrants will be doing in the early days of the 2020 campaign.]Mr. Castro, 44, was raised in San Antonio in a politically active family. His mother, Rosie Castro, was an activist with the Mexican-American political party La Raza Unida and frequently took Juli\u00e1n and his twin brother, Joaquin \u2014 now a congressman \u2014 to rallies and meetings. Joaquin Castro will be the chairman of Juli\u00e1n\u2019s campaign.At the age of 26, Mr. Castro became San Antonio\u2019s youngest City Council member, and after one unsuccessful campaign for mayor in 2005, he was elected to the city\u2019s top job in 2009. In 2012, he delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention \u2014 the same platform that catapulted Barack Obama, then a little-known state senator, to national prominence in 2004. Mr. Obama, as president, later chose him to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development.In a statement on Saturday, the Republican National Committee previewed one of the main arguments it is likely to use against Mr. Castro, calling him a \u201clightweight\u201d without the experience needed to be president.Mr. Castro has brushed off concerns that he is not as experienced or as well known as many of the other likely candidates.\u201cIn my whole life, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever started out as the front-runner,\u201d he told The New York Times last month. \u201cI grew up in a neighborhood where nobody growing up there was the front-runner at anything. So I\u2019m not going to concern myself with who people think of as the front-runner and who they don\u2019t.\u201dAmong the Democrats frequently mentioned as 2020 contenders, he is one of the youngest. If elected, he would be the third-youngest person ever to become president, after Theodore Roosevelt (42) and John F. Kennedy (43).The full field of candidates could include former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, who ran a high-profile but unsuccessful campaign against Senator Ted Cruz last year.Surrounded by his supporters after the speech, Mr. Castro was asked whether he expected to face a fellow Texan, Mr. O\u2019Rourke, in the race. \u201cThere will probably be 15 or 20 people in the race, so it\u2019s going to be crowded,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "Government Shutdown Squeezes Contractors as Checks Stop and Invoices Stall", "category": "Business", "id": "6f0ac91f-8e83-49ac-bb30-310371e7fc5d", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/business/contractors-government-shutdown-effect.html", "publishdate": 20190112, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/13/us/politics/13contractors-promo/13contractors-promo-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "When Christopher Fuller and his research team received a \u201cstop work order\u201d on New Year\u2019s Eve, they had four hours to shut down their lab, making sure their chemical and biological samples were securely stored in refrigerators that would keep running if the electricity was shut off.Mr. Fuller had spent the previous few months with the Environmental Protection Agency in Durham, N.C., studying approaches to decontamination after a biological weapons attack. He is one of legions of contractors hired by the federal government who are suddenly out of work because of the shutdown.As the shutdown has dragged on to become the longest in American history, these contractors have found themselves in the same predicament as the roughly 800,000 federal employees who are not being paid \u2014 except the outcome may be worse. Many contract workers, unlike federal employees, do not expect to be reimbursed for unpaid wages once President Trump and Congress agree to reopen the government.\u201cWe are the ones that do the research and gather the data alongside federal workers,\u201d Mr. Fuller said, \u201cyet we don\u2019t have the same safety net or same visibility.\u201dThere is no official source that tracks the number of contract employees or recipients of federal grants, nor is there recent data showing how many businesses and self-employed professionals have had their contracts suspended during the shutdown. But they are a vital and vast network of workers with jobs that run the gamut: a prep cook in an Agriculture Department cafeteria, a dairy farm appraiser, a radar operator who tracks severe storms.The struggles of federal contractors show how the shutdown is rippling across the broader economy. Small businesses that rely on government work are in turmoil, as invoices for already completed work go unpaid. On top of that, they have no way to predict when new work may resume, leaving many in the precarious position of trying to wait out the shutdown or seek different work.\u201cYou are talking about a big slice of the work force,\u201d said Paul Light, a professor at New York University who studies federal workers. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a worse time to have a shutdown, as some think we are headed toward a recession.\u201dMr. Light estimates there are 4.1 million federal contractors and grant recipients, not all of whom have been affected by the shutdown. The majority \u2014 about 2.8 million \u2014 are in service jobs, from health aides to computer programmers.In 2017, according to Mr. Light, the federal government paid out an estimated $465 billion in contracts, and that amount is expected to have grown last year with increases in military spending.Government contractors, for the most part, have kept a low profile, not wanting to interrupt the highly competitive but dependable flow of government work. The shutdown has changed that. Many have taken to social media, given interviews and penned op-eds, criticizing leaders in Washington for putting them out of work.\u201cI am surprised by it,\u201d Mr. Light said. \u201cTrump is someone who takes names. But contractors are compliant to a point. They have businesses they need to run. It is a sign of just how bad it is.\u201dJessica Kostrab is an agent booking tours and hotel reservations for visitors to Mount Rainier National Park in Washington State.

The town where she lives, Ashford, relies on tourism from the park. It\u2019s possible to find work in Tacoma and Seattle, but gas for the round trip would cost more than what she could make in an entry-level job.\u201cThere is a big chunk of people completely at a loss for what they want to do while we wait,\u201d Ms. Kostrab said in an interview.This week, Senate Democrats have been highlighting the struggles of low-wage contractors, like cafeteria workers and janitors. Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, is planning to introduce a bill that would secure back pay for furloughed contract workers.The uncertainty is particularly difficult for small contractors who manage their businesses with little cushion for an interruption like the three-week shutdown.Afshin Levy has been in the dark for weeks. He runs a small factory in Los Angeles, and he has a contract from federal offices for sets of tablecloths and napkins. He\u2019s not sure he will be paid if he goes through with the orders. Without that revenue, he said, he will have a hard time making his payroll.\u201cIt seems everyone is talking about government employees,\u201d Mr. Levy said. \u201cBut we are lost in all this. I am responsible for 30 people who need to be paid.\u201dSome businesses haven\u2019t been paid for work they completed in October. Others are not sure whether they are required to fulfill their current contracts. With many agencies closed, there is often no one to call to clarify.The effects of a prolonged shutdown could linger for months, even years. Contractors may be more tepid about expanding their businesses and bidding for more government work. The political animosity that produced the current stalemate may result in another government shutdown in the near future. There were three shutdowns in 2018, including this one.Some contract workers, particularly highly skilled engineers and scientists, may leave for other jobs, outside government work. New college graduates may steer clear altogether.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make public service look like the place you want to spend your career,\u201d said David J. Berteau, chief executive of the Professional Services Council, a trade group representing federal contractors.Since the E.P.A. closed its doors on Mr. Fuller, he and his wife, a teacher, have had to dip into savings to keep up with mortgage payments and child care for their 6-month-old son.He has started looking for a new job in case the shutdown stretches on. He regrets that his research on chemical and biological warfare has been stalled.\u201cI went into science because it allows you to ask profound questions and solve problems,\u201d Mr. Fuller said. \u201cI have no words that begin to describe how needless and senseless this whole shutdown is.\u201d"}, {"title": "The Many Times Megyn Kelly Became the Story", "category": "Business", "id": "bc8c28e3-aa29-47bf-94a2-b635b889fede", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/business/media/controversies-megyn-kelly.html", "publishdate": 20190112, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/02/business/00megynkelly-top/merlin_127707038_54ea929f-88f3-4d77-985e-23d336eb53e2-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Don\u2019t become the story. That\u2019s an adage in the news business that most journalists try to live by, even in a time that rewards self-promotion. And it\u2019s a rule that Megyn Kelly flouted again and again. While this tendency was not much of a factor in her previous job, as a prime-time anchor at Fox News, it created complications during her 18-month stint at NBC.The network canceled her show, \u201cMegyn Kelly Today,\u201d days after she suggested on air that dressing up in blackface for Halloween was appropriate for white people. Ms. Kelly\u2019s comments, and the uproar that followed, felt familiar to many fans and critics.[NBC and Megyn Kelly part ways with the full $69 million from her contract.]Those who become stars at major broadcast networks have a rare talent for being interesting and innocuous at the same time. Ms. Kelly, a former corporate lawyer who made her name as a sometimes confrontational interviewer, struggled to walk that line.Here is a look at the times Ms. Kelly became the story.December 2013 Weighing In on Santa and JesusOn her Fox News show, \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d Ms. Kelly took issue with an essay in Slate arguing that the popular image of Santa Claus as a white man was due for a makeover. \u201cFor all of you kids watching at home, Santa just is white,\u201d Ms. Kelly said.Later in the discussion, she added, \u201cJesus was a white man, too.\u201d In the panel discussion that followed, she did not acknowledge research that traces St. Nicholas to a fourth-century bishop in what is now Turkey and scholarship that has long debated what Jesus actually looked like.Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, who hosted shows on Comedy Central at the time, led the rhetorical charge against Ms. Kelly\u2019s remarks. \u201cYou do know Jesus wasn\u2019t born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, right?\u201d Mr. Stewart said.May 2016 Kelly vs. TrumpMs. Kelly\u2019s feud with Donald J. Trump \u2014 which broadened her appeal beyond her Fox News base \u2014 began in Cleveland during the first Republican presidential debate in August 2015. Before a prime-time audience, Ms. Kelly questioned the candidate about his history of denigrating women as pigs, dogs and \u201cslobs.\u201d After the event, Mr. Trump added Ms. Kelly to his list of Twitter targets, saying she \u201creally bombed\u201d as a moderator. He also told an interviewer that, during the debate, Ms. Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever\u201d \u2014 a comment widely interpreted as a reference to menstruation.Mr. Trump refused to participate in a later debate that Ms. Kelly moderated in Iowa. The attention raised her profile but also made her the target of death threats, she later wrote in her memoir. Fox News stood by its host, issuing a statement that Mr. Trump had an \u201cextreme, sick obsession\u201d with her.After months of Mr. Trump calling Ms. Kelly \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201coverrated\u201d and \u201csick,\u201d Roger E. Ailes, then the chairman of Fox News, tried to broker a truce between his star and the candidate at Trump Tower. Weeks later, Ms. Kelly sat down to interview the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But the tough questions went missing. Critics described the tone of the interview \u2014 part of a Fox News prime-time special that aired in May 2016 \u2014 as \u201ccrushed velvet\u201d and \u201cneither groundbreaking nor especially informative.\u201dAfter the interview, Mr. Trump posted a supportive message on Twitter: \u201cWell done Megyn \u2014 and they all lived happily ever after!\u201dJune 2017 A Tepid Interview With Vladimir PutinWhen NBC hired Ms. Kelly, it planned to make her a force of its news division. Not only would she host the third hour of its morning franchise, the \u201cToday\u201d show, she would also host a Sunday night newsmagazine program meant to challenge \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on CBS.The debut episode of \u201cSunday Night With Megyn Kelly\u201d had a big guest: Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. But during the one-on-one interview, Mr. Putin proved unwilling to offer up more than his presence, evading or delivering pat answers to Ms. Kelly\u2019s questions about allegations of Russia\u2019s interference in the American presidential election. After Ms. Kelly asked about possible communications between the Trump campaign and the Russian ambassador to the United States, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s complete nonsense. Do you even understand what you\u2019re asking?\u201dCritics branded the interview as \u201cboring,\u201d a \u201clukewarm flop\u201d and a \u201crough start.\u201d The New Yorker said Ms. Kelly had been \u201cout-manipulated.\u201d June 2017 Platform for a Conspiracy TheoristThe third guest for \u201cSunday Night With Megyn Kelly\u201d was Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist who founded Infowars. Before the episode aired, families of children and teachers killed in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. \u2014 which Mr. Jones has called a hoax \u2014 pleaded with NBC not to give him publicity, especially in a segment scheduled for Father\u2019s Day. Before the interview, critics accused Ms. Kelly of being too cozy with Mr. Jones, especially after Infowars published audio of her cajoling and flattering him to do the interview by saying she did not want to portray him \u201cas some boogeyman.\u201d Mr. Jones also released a photo from the day of the interview that showed him and Ms. Kelly in a car. In the picture, she was smiling and wearing sunglasses.Parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting asked NBC to spike the interview, and a Connecticut affiliate announced that it would not air the program. Ms. Kelly was also disinvited from a Sandy Hook charity event and accused by some viewers of infecting NBC with Fox News-style conservatism.Face to face with Mr. Jones, Ms. Kelly challenged him repeatedly and described his claims as \u201creckless accusation, followed by equivocations and excuses.\u201d But by then the public relations battle had been lost.September 2017 Debra Messing Sends Her RegretsWith her Sunday night troubles behind her, it was time for the unveiling of Ms. Kelly as the host of \u201cMegyn Kelly Today.\u201d Her challenge? Prove to audiences \u2014 and the NBC executives who had given her a three-year, $69 million contract \u2014 that she could make herself at home in the bubbly environs of morning television.Her first guests were the creators and cast of the rebooted NBC sitcom \u201cWill & Grace.\u201d Debra Messing, a star of the show, seemed enthusiastic about promoting the return of the groundbreaking comedy \u2014 which broke taboos about the portrayal of gay characters in mainstream entertainment in the late 1990s.During the segment Ms. Kelly called out to a \u201cWill & Grace\u201d superfan who happened to be in the audience, inviting him to the stage of Studio 6A. The audience applauded as the beaming man received hugs from the sitcom\u2019s stars. And then came Ms. Kelly\u2019s question: \u201cIs it true that you became a lawyer, and you became gay, because of Will?\u201d The suggestion that sexual orientation is a choice prompted many of Ms. Messing\u2019s fans to criticize her participation on Ms. Kelly\u2019s program, and the actress said on Instagram that her appearance with the show had been a mistake. \u201cRegret going on,\u201d Ms. Messing wrote. \u201cDismayed by her comments.\u201dAnd despite a big promotional push, the show\u2019s first week drew lackluster ratings.September 2017 The Jane Fonda Tussle, Part 1Ms. Kelly\u2019s first week on \u201cToday\u201d also included an awkward encounter with a Hollywood legend. Jane Fonda assumed she was sitting down with Ms. Kelly to discuss \u201cOur Souls at Night,\u201d the film she had made with Robert Redford. But the host wanted to talk about Ms. Fonda\u2019s plastic surgery. When pressed, the actress fixed Ms. Kelly with a glare that later became a meme. \u201cWe really want to talk about that now?\u201d Ms. Fonda asked.January 2018 The RematchMs. Fonda continued to talk to other outlets about the interview, telling Variety that it \u201cstunned\u201d her and was \u201cso inappropriate.\u201d She even referred to it on the Jan. 16 edition of \u201cToday,\u201d drawing laughter from the hosts, Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie.On Jan. 22, Ms. Kelly hit back, saying at the top of a three-minute segment that \u201cit\u2019s time to address the \u2018poor me\u2019 routine.\u201d After telling viewers that she had \u201cno regrets about that question,\u201d she added, \u201cNor am I in the market for a lesson from Jane Fonda on what is and is not appropriate.\u201dSounding more like a Fox News pundit than a \u201cToday\u201d show host, Ms. Kelly went on to question Ms. Fonda\u2019s patriotism. She made a reference to \u201cHanoi Jane\u201d \u2014 a nickname attached to the actress after her 1972 visit to North Vietnam and the resulting photo of her seated on an antiaircraft gun, which Ms. Fonda has since called her biggest regret. The actress \u201cstill says she\u2019s not proud of America,\u201d Ms. Kelly said, \u201cso the moral indignation is a little much.\u201dJanuary 2018 The Body-Shaming BrouhahaWhen Ms. Kelly was in law school, she found herself gaining weight. Eager to slim down, she asked her stepfather to shame her whenever she went into the kitchen. \u201cAnd it works,\u201d she said with a thumbs-up gesture during a segment about a mother who posted photos of the svelte physique she was able to maintain while raising three young children. \u201cWhat\u2019s your excuse?\u201d the mother added in a caption.Ms. Kelly went all in on the shaming regimen during her interview of the mother. \u201cYou should parlay the shaming thing into a professional business,\u201d the host said. \u201cBecause some of us want to be shamed!\u201dThe comments did not go over well, with Meghan McCain noting on Twitter that fat shaming has \u201creal-life ramifications.\u201d\u201cI still cringe when I hear a person attacked for his or her weight,\u201d Ms. Kelly said on her show the next day. \u201cPlease know I would never encourage that toward any person. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about why I once encouraged it toward myself.\u201d"}, {"title": "The Week in Business: CBS News Gets Its First Female President, and Theranos Goes Back to Court", "category": "Business", "id": "974abdc2-2a48-458a-b2b9-5cd40a7ec12b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/business/the-week-in-business.html", "publishdate": 20190112, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/13/business/13WithInterest1/merlin_149024418_7c2fe8a3-b083-4765-8365-8ad413e99cfe-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Want this column in your inbox?

Your Government, Not at WorkThe government shutdown continues to drag on, but at least tax refunds won\u2019t be held up. The White House will order some Internal Revenue Service employees to return to work so that the tax filing season can begin and refunds can be issued. But this is a rare positive turn as the shutdown\u2019s effects pile up. Crucial government loans have stalled. The Food and Drug Administration has stopped routine safety inspections of vegetables, fish, and other groceries (yikes). The Miami airport is closing a terminal because of a shortage of Transportation Security Administration officers. And despite volunteers' efforts, the public bathrooms at some national parks remain gross.The Fed\u2019s Cooler HeadYou can stop fretting about loan rates going up, at least for now. The Fed is taking a more cautious approach to raising interest rates, according to documents released from its December meeting. Like the rest of us, officials are wary about downshifts in economic growth and trade tensions with China. (The latter seemed a bit less ominous after trade talks last week, but bigger sticking points have yet to be resolved.) The Fed still plans to increase rates twice this year, but probably not at its January or March meetings. As the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, put it on Thursday, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be patient and watching, and waiting and seeing.\u201dAnother Glass Ceiling BreaksCBS News made a surprise announcement on Sunday that Susan Zirinsky would succeed David Rhodes as its new (and first female) president. The inspiration for the ambitious, principled character played by Holly Hunter in the movie \u201cBroadcast News,\u201d Ms. Zirinsky has been at CBS for over four decades. She\u2019s got her work cut out for her: The network has recently weathered numerous bombshells about its corporate culture and fired several prominent figures \u2014 most notably its morning show anchor Charlie Rose and its chief executive, Leslie Moonves \u2014 after they were accused of sexual misconduct.ImageCreditGiacomo BagnaraJAN. 13-19What\u2019s Next? This Song Again?Yes, we\u2019ve heard this before: The British Parliament will vote this Tuesday on a proposal for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. No one expects the beleaguered Brexit plan to pass, just as it didn\u2019t back in December, and Prime Minister Theresa May is scrambling to pull together a backup strategy. Desperate measures may soon be in order, and Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of Austria became the first European Union leader to suggest an extension of Brexit\u2019s March 29 deadline. But would more time change anybody\u2019s mind?It\u2019s Earnings SeasonThe six largest banks in the United States will report their fourth-quarter results this week. If they report lower than expected numbers, the news could be read as another canary in the coal mine for a potential economic slowdown. Most banks have booked record returns for almost a year, thanks to tax cuts and a humming economy, but volatile markets at the end of 2018 could have put an end to this streak. Citigroup will release its earnings on Monday, followed by JPMorgan and Wells Fargo on Tuesday and Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America on Wednesday.More Bad BloodWe haven\u2019t heard much recently about Theranos, the seemingly miraculous blood-testing start-up that last year turned out to a giant fraud. But that may change on Monday, when a federal court in California holds a hearing on criminal charges against Theranos\u2019s former chief executive, Elizabeth Holmes, and its former president, Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani (also Ms. Holmes\u2019s erstwhile boyfriend). Indicted on charges of conspiracy and wire fraud last summer, they could each face prison sentences of up to 20 years.What Else?Lots of car news these days. The North American International Auto Show, one of the world\u2019s biggest, hits Detroit on Monday; electric cars are expected to be a hot topic. Fiat Chrysler agreed on Wednesday to pay nearly $650 million to settle lawsuits over its use of illegal software on diesel vehicles to produce false results on emissions tests. Tangentially related: The Chrysler building \u2014 once New York City\u2019s tallest structure \u2014 is for sale.What Counts$137 billion: The net worth of Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive and the world\u2019s richest man. But that number may soon change, as Mr. Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Bezos, announced their divorce last Wednesday.

She cited her work to reform the juvenile criminal justice system in California as one of her biggest policy accomplishments. She talked about the necessity for Democrats to work in a bipartisan fashion while standing strong against a White House that many of their voters view as corrupt.It was a broad, biography-heavy message \u2014 not a rigid ideological mantra \u2014 meant to lay groundwork for a national profile as she prepares a next possible step: joining a growing field of Democrats who will compete to take on President Trump.\u201cAnything worth fighting for is a fight worth having,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cThere is a democracy in place, and if we fight \u2014 maybe we won\u2019t win all the time \u2014 but it will matter.\u201dBut as some audience members noted after her remarks, and voters nationwide may learn soon, almost everything about Ms. Harris is more complex than it appears.Though rated as one of the most liberal members of the Senate, Ms. Harris speaks less about Wall Street corruption and economic populism than do Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, two fellow senators who are also looking to a 2020 matchup against Mr. Trump. Ms. Harris has built a devoted following because of her Senate committee interrogations of Trump administration officials, but she remains disliked by some criminal justice activists who say her policies as California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney helped increase the state\u2019s prison population.Even her race and her life story \u2014 she is often described as one of two African-American women to have served in the Senate \u2014 are more textured in context: She has a Tamil Indian mother and a Jamaican father and spent some of her teenage years in Montreal.Ava Leegant, a surgeon from San Francisco who came to the event skeptical of Ms. Harris\u2019s presidential chances, said she left bullish about her appeal.\u201cI didn\u2019t think someone from California could speak to all parts of the country,\u201d Ms. Leegant said, \u201cbut I was impressed.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s my first choice to be my first choice,\u201d said Betsy Kagen, a 33-year-old film editor who attended the talk.The themes of Ms. Harris\u2019s new book, \u201cThe Truths We Hold: An American Journey,\u201d could help her stand out in a crowded Democratic presidential primary. More than a dozen candidates are expected to join the presidential race in the coming months, and as the party searches for its next iteration after two decades of dominance by the Clintons and Barack Obama, questions of policy, identity and tone in the campaign will be paramount.Longtime strategists and admirers of Ms. Harris believe she is well positioned to create electoral coalitions among Democrats desperate to beat Mr. Trump, partly because she is not tethered to any one of the divergent and sometimes warring factions of the party. On MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Friday morning, Ms. Harris was asked, \u201cWhy would you want to be president?\u201d and responded by citing the need for leaders who have a \u201cvision of our country in which everyone can see themselves.\u201d\u201cHer message of unity, that\u2019s the key,\u201d said Valoree Celona, a 50-year-old insurance executive who came to the 92nd Street Y with friends. \u201cIf she can get people to have that hope again, that\u2019s what\u2019s important. That\u2019s what President Obama did.\u201dBut Ms. Harris would also need to grapple with Democratic rivals who are more ideologically liberal and may try to move the debate to the left in ways that could force difficult choices for her.Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and 2016 presidential candidate who is considering running again, has demonstrated an ability to shift conversation toward more populist themes like free public colleges and campaign finance reform. Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator who became the first major candidate to announce presidential intentions and head to Iowa, has drawn attention for challenging Democratic candidates to propose a more broad restructuring of American society that would address economic inequality. Ms. Warren rarely mentioned Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, and is pushing primary candidates to have a more policy-driven discussion.\u201cWe need change,\u201d Ms. Warren said at multiple stops during her Iowa trip. \u201cAnd not just one statute here or one law there. We need big structural change.\u201dRebecca Katz, a progressive political consultant based in New York who is not working for a 2020 candidate, said she believes that women and nonwhite candidates are scrutinized more than white male politicians, yet hopes that Ms. Harris will embrace bold ideas and tell more of her personal story even if it seems risky. Mo Elleithee, the former spokesman of the Democratic National Committee who now leads Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service, said that much of the country is still unaware of Ms. Harris, and that she has time to refine a national narrative that resonates with many groups of Democrats.Reviews of Ms. Harris\u2019s book have been mixed, as critics have accused her of not adequately grappling with several controversial stances she took as California attorney general and others have characterized it as overly reliant on political clich\u00e9s.In the memoir, which was released simultaneously with a children\u2019s book by Ms. Harris called \u201cSuperheroes Are Everywhere,\u201d she repeatedly writes that she does not believe in \u201cfalse choices.\u201d This can mean both meaningful workers\u2019 rights and a strong economy, she writes at one point, but she also applies the concept to police accountability and public safety.\u201cI know how hard it is for the officers\u2019 families, who have to wonder if the person they love will be coming home at the end of each shift,\u201d Ms. Harris writes. \u201cI also know this: It is a false choice to suggest you must either be for the police or for police accountability. I am for both. Most people I know are for both. Let\u2019s speak some truth about that, too.\u201dSean Clegg, a longtime political adviser who is expected to play a senior role in any presidential campaign from Ms. Harris, said that if she ran she would discuss issues like income inequality, but that the message would be coupled with a call for partisan healing.Paul Berkman, a 72-year-old New Yorker who attended the book talk, said he wished Ms. Harris talked about more policy ideas during her conversation, which was moderated by the poet Cleo Wade. Mr. Berkman said he left not knowing her answer to the \u201cwhy-are-you-running-for-president\u201d question every candidate faces.\u201cShe seems like a likable person, but there\u2019s so many candidates \u2014 I want someone to verbalize why it should be them,\u201d he said.Sarah Weiss, a 33-year-old book editor, said she was disappointed by Ms. Harris\u2019s talk, especially after the heavy policy focus of Ms. Warren\u2019s trip to Iowa.\u201cMy concern is that she\u2019s not liberal enough, and she talks in clich\u00e9s that are kind of meaningless,\u201d Ms. Weiss said of Ms. Harris. \u201cShe keeps saying there\u2019s more that connects us than divides us, but at this time in politics, it seems like that\u2019s not enough.\u201dAt that point her friend Rachel Steinberg chimed in: \u201cShe is not running for president yet! She doesn\u2019t need a platform.\u201dThey agreed to disagree."}, {"title": "Tulsi Gabbard, Representative From Hawaii, Announces Democratic Presidential Bid", "category": "Politics", "id": "af74fc09-a9c2-445c-afff-69e92ae12705", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-2020-president-announcement.html", "publishdate": 20190112, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/12/us/politics/12gabbard/merlin_148725849_2eaa8a4f-e96f-4ac3-a0ae-c5bd9ba738e2-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said Friday that she would run for president, joining what is expected to be a crowded field of Democrats seeking to challenge President Trump in 2020.Ms. Gabbard announced her decision to CNN in an interview with the political commentator Van Jones that is scheduled to air on Saturday. \u201cI have decided to run,\u201d she said in a short clip posted Friday, \u201cand will be making a formal announcement within the next week.\u201dWhen we stand together, united by our love for each other and for our country, there is no challenge we cannot overcome.

An Army National Guard veteran who deployed twice to the Middle East, she was first elected to the House in 2012, a decade after she became the youngest person elected to the Hawaii State Legislature. She was the first Hindu and the first American Samoan elected to Congress.Since then, she has earned a reputation for her opposition to American military intervention and \u201cregime change\u201d efforts abroad \u2014 and for sometimes breaking from the Democratic Party line. In 2015, she voted with Republicans to increase screening of Syrian refugees. Shortly thereafter, she startled the Democratic National Committee by calling for more presidential debates than the party wanted to hold.And just this week, she wrote an op-ed accusing fellow Democrats of \u201creligious bigotry\u201d for sharply questioning a judicial nominee, Brian Buescher, on his membership in the Knights of Columbus. (Though she did not name names, her targets were clear: Senator Kamala Harris of California, another likely presidential candidate, and Senator Mazie Hirono, who also represents Hawaii.)Ms. Gabbard also endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primaries \u2014 resigning as vice chairwoman of the D.N.C. to do so \u2014 when most party officials were circling the wagons around Hillary Clinton. That creates an interesting dynamic for the 2020 race because Mr. Sanders may run again.Experience could be a major vulnerability for Ms. Gabbard, who was re-elected in November. The only sitting representative elected president was James Garfield in 1880, and most presidents have previously been a senator or governor.She will be 39 on Inauguration Day in 2021, which would make her, if elected, the youngest president in American history. Only two presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy, have taken office before age 45.But perhaps a more serious liability for her campaign will be her interactions with Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. A longtime opponent of the United States\u2019 military involvement in Syria, Ms. Gabbard visited Mr. Assad in Damascus in January 2017 \u2014 something other American officials had not done since Mr. Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons against civilians became widely known. Her noninterventionist perspective and her desire for diplomacy could appeal to many progressive Democrats, but her decision to meet with a man who had attacked his own people angered many others.\u201cI think we should be ready to meet with anyone if there\u2019s a chance it can help bring about an end to this war, which is causing the Syrian people so much suffering,\u201d she said at the time.Republicans quickly jumped on her campaign announcement, emphasizing her visit with Mr. Assad and declaring that Ms. Gabbard had no political base.\u201cLiberals think she\u2019s too conservative, conservatives think she\u2019s too liberal, and just about everyone thinks her coziness with Bashar al-Assad is disturbing,\u201d said Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.Ms. Gabbard is one of the first Democrats to declare her candidacy \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren jumped in on New Year\u2019s Eve, the former West Virginia state senator Richard Ojeda did so in November, and former Representative John Delaney has been running for a year and a half \u2014 but the floodgates are likely to open in the coming weeks.Announcements are possible from Ms. Harris, Mr. Sanders and Senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Amy Klobuchar, as well as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman who gained enormous attention for his unsuccessful campaign against Senator Ted Cruz last year."}, {"title": "Gin\u2019s Journey in Britain, From \u2018Mother\u2019s Ruin\u2019 to a Hipster Drink", "category": "Business", "id": "89092da2-05ef-47a2-ad81-14464bd51f01", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/business/gin-industry-drinks-britain.html", "publishdate": 20190113, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/13/business/00gin-1/00gin-1-articleLarge.gif", "content": "LONDON \u2014 Ever since European apothecaries began distilling gin and selling it as a cure-all in the 16th century, the juniper-flavored liquor has been revered as a medicine, vilified for fueling public disorder and consumed in a multitude of every-season cocktails. Now, it is stirring up a specialized tourist trade in the homeland of London dry gin thanks in part to entrepreneurial bottling and branding. After surging for a decade, gin sales in Britain reached nearly 2 billion pounds, or about $2.6 billion, through last fall, compared with \u00a31.26 billion for the same period in 2017, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. Drinkers of pink and flavored versions have helped make it the country\u2019s second-most-popular spirit, ahead of whiskeys and behind only vodka, the group said. Gin has become so popular in Britain that the Office for National Statistics added it back to the basket of goods it uses to measure inflation, after a 13-year absence. Many of the newer products share the flavor of juniper, but others vary widely from traditional dry gin, which, by European law, must be distilled from natural plant materials and have a minimum of 37.5 percent alcohol by volume. The revival has spawned gin-flavored marmalade and gin-scented candles, prompting fears of overkill among some British producers. As a result, they are seeking new growth overseas.

Issued in 1751 with a companion piece, \"Beer Street,\" the engraving was meant to support the Gin Act, which reined in production of the juniper-flavored liquor.  CreditCulture Club/Getty ImagesThe birth of a new boom Sam Galsworthy and Fairfax Hall, childhood friends from Britain, were working in the beverage industry in the United States in the early 2000s and watching microbreweries and craft distilleries multiply around them. They set about starting a gin distillery in West London in 2007, but were quickly stymied by bureaucratic rules stretching back more than 250 years. In 1751, British officials, worried that too many people were succumbing to so-called mother\u2019s ruin, passed the Gin Act to stamp out small-scale and home production by limiting gin making to stills with a capacity of at least 1,800 liters. Mr. Galsworthy and Mr. Hall lobbied the government to ease the restriction, and in 2009, their company, Sipsmith, was granted a license to produce gin. The move opened the door for other small distilleries. Gin making has exploded in Britain since then. The number of distilleries grew to 419 in 2018 from 113 in 2009, according to the Office for National Statistics. The distilleries have become popular tourist destinations. Sipsmith says it gets about 25,000 visitors a year. Taste-testers like that \u2014 those buying the experience as well as the gin \u2014 have helped fuel the growth in sales. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a food culture that probably didn\u2019t exist in the U.K. 20 years ago,\u201d said Miles Beale, chief executive of Britain\u2019s Wine and Spirit Trade Association. \u201cPeople are drinking less, but they\u2019re more interested in what they\u2019re drinking.

He tracked down the owners\u2019 descendants, and although they didn\u2019t give him a recipe, they identified several ingredients. With that and some guesswork, he came up with Old Bakery Gin, which is now sold at Harrods and Fortnum & Mason. Mr. Puddick\u2019s tale is one of many origin stories whetting the appetite of the new generation of gin connoisseurs. Oscar Dodd, a Fortnum & Mason buyer, said shoppers often wanted to learn more about the provenance or ingredients of their purchases. \u201cThey\u2019re nearly all looking for something new and exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a social currency with gin.

Diageo, which owns popular brands like Gordon\u2019s and Tanqueray, added a Japanese-inspired gin to its offering. Smaller entrants from other parts of the world are also getting into the market.

And new distilleries are popping up from Australia to Liechtenstein to the United States, said Nicholas Cook, the director of the Gin Guild in Britain. Gin\u2019s appeal, he said, is that \u201cit\u2019s both grown-up and hipster at the same time.\u201d Joseph Judd, who helped found Peddlers Gin, said even as the company sought to increase its global reach, especially in Asia, it was hewing to the liquor\u2019s European heritage. \u201cI think it would be difficult to come with purely Chinese ingredients and disregard the British perspective,\u201d Mr. Judd said. \u201cWith gin, you have to respect the process and the history.\u201d "}, {"title": "Stung by Florida Midterm Losses, Democrats See a Swing State Drifting Away", "category": "Politics", "id": "90865737-c5c2-4a3f-85e3-98c4b70e58bc", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/florida-democrats-2020-election.html", "publishdate": 20190113, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/11/us/politics/00floridadems1/merlin_146380266_31a41cbb-43e6-4801-9870-be1024a8ac9e-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. \u2014 After a painful midterm election for Florida Democrats that showed this crucial swing state drifting away from them, a group of party activists gathered at a Cuban restaurant last month to receive some bitter medicine \u2014 and a sober warning \u2014 to go with their croquettes and plantain chips.Democrats started organizing Latino voters too late, didn\u2019t tailor their message for an increasingly diverse community and ultimately took Latino support for granted, a Florida pollster told about 50 members of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Broward County.Democrats will lose again in 2020 if they don\u2019t move swiftly to win over Hispanics, the pollster, Eduardo Gamarra, told the group. \u201cYou just need to start now,\u201d he said.With the swearing-in last Tuesday of two newly elected Republican leaders, Gov. Ron DeSantis and Senator Rick Scott, Florida has become a more reliably red political bastion, making the path to Electoral College victory that much tougher for the 2020 Democratic nominee.For Republicans, Florida stands out as the best political news from an otherwise grim year, a show of strength in a state that has voted for every presidential winner since 1992 and seems to be growing more favorable to their party at a moment when demographic changes are lifting Democrats elsewhere. The successful courting of up-for-grabs Hispanics, the surge of transplanted senior voters, the solidifying support in conservative North Florida: All illustrate why this prized battleground state is tilting to the right.As for Democrats, they remain just as shellshocked as they were after Election Day, when it became clear that Bill Nelson, the state\u2019s longtime senator, and Andrew Gillum, the electrifying young mayor of Tallahassee, had lost by exceedingly close margins. As of Tuesday, there was still only one Democrat in statewide office.\u201cWe just live in a red state here,\u201d said Alex Sink, a former Democratic state official who once narrowly lost a bid for governor. \u201cI think it\u2019s just tilted toward the Republicans now, and I hate to say that.\u201dThe question looming over the state going into 2020 is the same one Democrats are wrestling with elsewhere: How can the party narrow its losses with voters who are older \u2014 and in many cases white \u2014 without alienating younger, nonwhite voters?What is so agonizing for Democrats is that 2018 did little to clarify the best path. The party put forward Mr. Gillum, a 39-year-old black progressive, and Mr. Nelson, a 76-year-old white moderate who had been in elected office for nearly half a century. Mr. Nelson lost by about 10,000 votes and Mr. Gillum didn\u2019t fare much worse, losing by about 32,000 votes.In other words, the party pursued two differing approaches in the same state and the same year \u2014 nominating a progressive who could mobilize voters difficult to turn out in midterms as well as a moderate who would appear more amenable to persuadable voters \u2014 and both failed.That has done little to extinguish the intraparty debate, after a banner year for Democrats nationally, when they gained 40 House seats and seven governorships amid a backlash against President Trump.Some moderates, including Ms. Sink, say flatly that Democrats would have won the governorship had they nominated former Representative Gwen Graham, who narrowly lost to Mr. Gillum in the primary. \u201cWhat would they have pinned on her?\u201d asked Ms. Sink, alluding to Mr. Gillum\u2019s left-wing politics and to an F.B.I. investigation into potential corruption in public real estate development in Tallahassee under Mr. Gillum.More broadly, the pragmatic wing of the party argues that the only way to win in such a dead-center state is to promote consensus-oriented candidates who can limit Republican margins in Florida\u2019s rural and exurban areas.ImageGov. Ron DeSantis and his wife, Casey, arrived for his inauguration ceremony in Tallahassee on Tuesday.CreditLynne Sladky/Associated PressMs. Graham said the results last year made it clear that \u201cyou have to have a candidate who can make a difference in areas where having a D behind your name makes people suspicious.\u201dMr. Nelson, the recently ousted Democratic senator, says he has a preferred 2020 candidate, who he thinks might turn things around: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u201cI would say of the whole crowd, I think Biden would have the best chance in Florida,\u201d Mr. Nelson said of the 2020 field, allowing that he has encouraged his former colleague to run and believes he would be perceived \u201cas moderate enough.\u201dBut these sorts of assessments make progressives want to pull their hair out.Pointing to the near-identical results, they argue that many of the state\u2019s conservative-leaning voters made little distinction between Mr. Gillum and Mr. Nelson. Mr. Gillum\u2019s supporters also note that he improved upon the losses of the last two Democratic nominees for governor, who were both white.\u201cHe got closer than anybody else did,\u201d said State Senator Oscar Braynon II, a Miami-area Democrat, pointing to how African-American turnout spiked from the last race for governor and suggesting no other candidate could have done that.If the Democrats\u2019 challenges in Florida are difficult to resolve, they are easy enough to diagnose.Florida is a microcosm of the country \u2014 and some of what is dogging Democrats in the state reflects the party\u2019s broader challenges.\u201cThis is not a progressive state,\u201d said Philip Levine, the former Miami Beach mayor who also ran unsuccessfully for governor. \u201cAnd that, in my opinion, is representative of the state of our country today. Florida is America.\u201dFlorida\u2019s rural white voters, as elsewhere, have abandoned their ancestral allegiances and become reliable Republicans.At the same time, Fox News-watching seniors from the Northeast and Midwest are flooding the state\u2019s retirement communities. They can be counted on to vote regularly, and they are increasingly supporting Republicans.\u201cYou have a lot of retirees who reminisce about their childhoods every time they hear Donald Trump say \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019\u201d said Representative Darren Soto, an Orlando Democrat. \u201cAnd they vote in a higher percentage than anybody else.\u201dThese transplants descending on Central Florida, the Gulf Coast, the Panhandle and parts of the Atlantic Coast run the socioeconomic gamut but share the same Republican loyalties. For example, two of the three counties with the strongest turnout in November were retiree hubs with notably different profiles.The party\u2019s best-performing county in the state was Sumter, the Central Florida enclave that is home to the Villages retirement community and its thousands of golf cart-driving, middle-class seniors. But turnout was nearly as strong in Collier County, a more well-heeled community on the gulf that includes Naples.Mr. Gillum and Mr. Nelson both received less than 35 percent of the vote in Collier County and less than 30 percent in Sumter County. These voters have little connection to state politics, are largely grounded in national issues and are overwhelmingly supportive of Mr. Trump.Mr. Nelson still sounded in near disbelief weeks after his loss, which he attributed to Mr. Scott\u2019s self-financing and the faulty design of the Broward County ballot, which all but hid the Senate race on a bottom corner of the page.ImagePeople protested Mr. DeSantis as he was sworn in on Tuesday.CreditLynne Sladky/Associated PressBut he seemed particularly anguished as he recounted losing the county where he grew up.\u201cWe only got 43 percent,\u201d he said of Brevard County, contending that many there were not aware of his roots or what he had done for nearby Cape Canaveral.Mr. Nelson recalled setting up a press round table at a local restaurant with a former NASA administrator who was supporting his campaign. When his staff arrived, he said, the manager on duty was so rude they decided to move the event elsewhere.\u201cHe was just a Trump guy,\u201d said Mr. Nelson, lamenting the state and country\u2019s drift toward what he called political \u201ctribalism.\u201dMore unique to Florida is the Republican Party\u2019s success at cutting deeply into the Democrats\u2019 share of the Latino vote.Hispanic voters in Florida are more ideologically diverse than elsewhere in the country, and Democrats have lagged behind Republicans in understanding the nuances of these voters. According to a postelection survey conducted by Mr. Scott\u2019s campaign, which courted the bloc relentlessly, he won 48 percent of the Latino vote.He and Mr. DeSantis both broadened the traditional Republican pitch to Cubans \u2014 that they represent the party of freedom \u2014 to woo more recent Central and South American immigrants who have also fled authoritarian regimes. And Mr. DeSantis used Mr. Gillum\u2019s support from Senator Bernie Sanders to label him a \u201csocialist,\u201d which has a more sinister connotation with these more recent \u00e9migr\u00e9s than with many Americans.Beyond Hispanics, Florida Republicans have long outperformed Democrats in their organizing efforts, especially when it comes to mobilizing reliably conservative voters in off-year elections. The party has had a virtual stranglehold on state government for more than two decades, giving it an advantage when it comes to redistricting, fund-raising from special interests and creating a farm system of new candidate talent.Democrats have not won the governor\u2019s mansion since 1994. The only Democrat in statewide office is Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, whose election represented one of the few bright spots for Florida Democrats this year, in addition to a ballot measure restoring voting rights to ex-felons.Ms. Fried\u2019s success offered Democrats a few clues for how to win in the state: She ran on legalizing medical marijuana, gun control and addressing Florida\u2019s toxic algae. And Ms. Fried spent the last 24 hours of her race in a decidedly unusual region for a Democrat: Florida\u2019s deep-red Panhandle.\u201cThere are so many issues that transcend partisan politics, and too many times we all get into our pigeonholes of what we\u2019re supposed to say and what we can get behind,\u201d she said.Last month, the local party leaders hosted Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, during Art Basel Miami Beach, one of the year\u2019s biggest events. Over lunch at Joe\u2019s Stone Crab, Democrats made the case for bringing the party\u2019s 2020 convention to Miami, acknowledging they could use the boost, according to Dan Gelber, the current Miami Beach mayor.\u201cOur toast tends to fall butter side down,\u201d he said.Few Democrats know that better than the veteran Hispanic activists who gathered in Broward County a few days later to listen to Dr. Gamarra, a professor at Florida International University who studies public opinion among Latinos.\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing over and over and over again,\u201d said Maurice A. Ferr\u00e9, who served as Miami\u2019s first Hispanic mayor from 1973 to 1985. The Democratic Party, he said, \u201cfeels that they can turn the switch on just a couple of months before.\u2019\u2019Well, it never worked that way,\u201d he said, \u201cand it never will.\u201d"}, {"title": "Electric Vehicles Are in the Spotlight at Detroit\u2019s 2019 Auto Show", "category": "Business", "id": "030fcdbc-0173-4ccd-8343-a9635007c9c8", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/business/detroit-auto-show-electric-cars.html", "publishdate": 20190113, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/14/business/14AUTOS1-print/merlin_148969212_37d17fbf-8e86-407e-80b8-5da07a953f27-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "ANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 Just before Thanksgiving, Ken Westerman came close to buying his first fully electric car, a Tesla Model 3.A retired music teacher with an interest in protecting the environment, Mr. Westerman was looking to replace the hybrid car he had been driving for years, a red Toyota Prius, and test-drove a Model 3. He was dazzled by the car but concluded that the limits of its range \u2014 300 miles on a single charge \u2014 would complicate his regular trips from Ann Arbor to the East Coast and Arkansas.\u201cThose are six- to eight-hour trips, and if you have to stop to charge up, that would add two hours each way,\u201d Mr. Westerman said. \u201cI absolutely loved the car, but the range was the killer.\u201d Instead of the Model 3, he bought another Prius.Mr. Westerman\u2019s decision should serve as a caution sign during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Electric vehicles will be a hot topic at the showcase, which opens to the news media and industry executives on Monday and to the public on Saturday.Automakers are preparing to introduce dozens of fully electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles over the next three years, and Hyundai, Kia, Mini, Nissan and Audi will display electric models due in the United States this year. It is a gambit based on the idea that many mainstream car owners will rush to make the leap from gasoline.But to sell all those cars, the manufacturers have to attract a new class of customer.Mainstream consumers may be harder to win over than the wealthy luxury car buyers, hard-core environmentalists and early adopters who have flocked to buy Model 3s and delivered Tesla\u2019s rapid sales growth. That may be especially true in the middle of the country, because charging stations are more sparse there than on the coasts, where most Tesla models are sold.Mr. Westerman, for example, said he\u2019d like an electric car with a range of 600 miles \u2014 about as far as his Prius takes him on a full tank of gas.Manufacturers are developing so many electrified models primarily to compete in China and Europe, where government subsidies and stringent environmental laws are spurring sales of zero-emission vehicles, said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. The sales pace is less certain in the United States, in part because gasoline remains cheap and the Trump administration has pulled back on emissions regulations.\u201cIn the U.S., you can\u2019t assume you\u2019re going to be selling 100,000 of one model,\u201d Mr. Wakefield said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to dedicate an entire factory to E.V.s\u201d \u2014 as Tesla has done.Last year, 361,000 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles were sold in the United States, just 2 percent of car purchases, according to estimates by InsideEVs.com. Tesla, which has struggled with production and delivery problems, accounted for half of those sales.But automakers have ambitious plans. Next year, Ford plans to introduce a small electric sport utility vehicle with a look influenced by its Mustang. The company is spending $11 billion to develop 16 battery-powered vehicles and 24 other types of electrified cars over the next five years.ImageA Cadillac CT6 plug-in hybrid sedan at a Shanghai auto show in 2017. General Motors plans to make all-electric vehicles a centerpiece of the Cadillac brand.CreditQilai Shen/Bloomberg\u201cIt\u2019s still early days, but we think people will be coming to us for electric vehicles,\u201d said Ted Cannis, the leader of Ford\u2019s Team Edison, which is developing its electric vehicles. \u201cWe think we\u2019re coming at the right time.\u201dGeneral Motors is making a similar push. On Friday, its chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said G.M. was increasing production of its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle and planned to make electric cars a key part of Cadillac\u2019s lineup.Automakers have concluded that improvements in battery technology and declining battery prices will enable them to produce electric cars with much greater range. Mr. Westerman\u2019s 600 miles may be unlikely soon, but far speedier recharging times are becoming a reality.For electric cars over all, one big hurdle is the availability of charging stations. While more are popping up in shopping centers and parking garages, with about 20,000 in the United States, they are vastly outnumbered by the 150,000 gas stations across the country. Homeowners can install charging units in garages, but the millions who live in apartments don\u2019t have that option.Chris Torrella, a college student who lives in a rented home in Ann Arbor with no garage, bought a Model 3 last March and found he had to go too far out of his way to get to the city\u2019s public chargers. His solution was one that few others may try: He persuaded his landlord to pay about $8,000 to modify the sidewalk in front of the house and install a public charging station at the curb.\u201cNow I can park on the street and charge up, and anyone else in the neighborhood who has a Tesla can, too,\u201d Mr. Torrella said.Charging time is another issue. Even Tesla\u2019s Superchargers require 40 minutes to provide an 80 percent charge. Doing the trick at home is generally an overnight job.Automakers are trying to address those challenges. G.M., Nissan, Volkswagen and others are working with partners to install more chargers. They are getting help from Electrify America, a company that Volkswagen funded as part of its agreement to settle lawsuits over its deception on diesel emissions. With a budget of $2 billion, Electrify America is aiming to install an initial wave of 600 chargers at gas stations, and 1,500 at office parks and apartment buildings. Three more waves are to follow.But even so, Electrify America\u2019s network will probably provide only 10 percent of the country\u2019s charging needs by 2021, the company\u2019s chief executive, Giovanni Palazzo, said at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November.\u201cWe can\u2019t make it happen on our own,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need more players.\u201dElectrify America is also hoping to install 350-kilowatt chargers within the next few years, which in theory could provide a full charge in about 15 minutes. About 80 percent of the chargers currently installed use 120 kilowatts, Mr. Palazzo said.One advantage that automakers are counting on is the wider variety of cars they will bring to the market. The Model 3, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Nissan Leaf are all small cars, a type of vehicle that fewer Americans are buying. Like Ford, Nissan is working on a roomier, S.U.V.-like model that it thinks will have wider appeal.\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of variety right now, but as more vehicles come up in the small and midsize S.U.V. body styles, it will bring in more people,\u201d said Brian Maragno, Nissan\u2019s director of E.V. sales and marketing strategy. \u201cThe market, in just a couple of years, is going to look very different.\u201d"}, {"title": "An Ocean Engineer and a Nuclear Physicist Walk Into Congress \u2026", "category": "Politics", "id": "f9566032-44c3-4931-99f9-28380b530266", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/scientists-congress.html", "publishdate": 20190113, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/07/us/politics/00stem1/merlin_146497578_3715074c-82fe-48ac-bb4e-ffbd2b013e59-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. \u2014 From a couch on the back deck of a dockside restaurant, the Beatles playing in the background and a breeze blowing off the water, Joe Cunningham gestured to Shem Creek.\u201cThis could be the reality here, of oil rigs and oil spills off the beach,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said. \u201cAn oil spill could just decimate the area, and all of a sudden instead of people coming to Charleston, South Carolina, they high-tail it down to Florida or somewhere else.\u201dOffshore drilling might not captivate voters in most parts of the country, but it did here. For months, Mr. Cunningham called for the restoration of a federal ban as his Republican opponent, Katie Arrington, talked about immigration and warned that a vote for him would be a vote for Nancy Pelosi\u2019s \u201cSan Francisco values.\u201d And in November, Mr. Cunningham, 36, defeated Ms. Arrington in a House district that last elected a Democrat four years before he was born.It was one of the biggest upsets of the midterms, and it turned on an ideal issue for a candidate who, before he became a lawyer, was an ocean engineer.\u201c\u2018We believe in science\u2019 \u2014 that line always drew applause,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s a sad state of affairs when you have to actually say that. Imagine someone saying that about any other subject, like, \u2018I believe in history\u2019 \u2014 topics that are proven with evidence and facts and numbers.\u201dImageLauren Underwood, a registered nurse, won Illinois\u2019s 14th District, a seat previously held by a Republican.CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesMr. Cunningham is one of at least 11 freshman representatives with a background in science, medicine or technology. Eight of them are Democrats, and they are some of the first victors of a trend that began soon after President Trump was elected: Alarmed by inaction on climate change and the administration\u2019s marginalization of experts, many more scientists have been entering politics.\u201cThere is this growing consensus among the scientific community that they need to go beyond advocacy and signing polite letters and actually get involved in electoral politics,\u201d said Shaughnessy Naughton, a chemist and the president of 314 Action, a two-year-old organization that supports candidates with scientific and medical backgrounds. The group \u2014 which raised $4 million for the 2018 elections \u2014 trained about 1,500 prospective candidates and supported the eight winning Democrats, as well as Senator Jacky Rosen and more than 30 successful state-level candidates. (While members of any party can attend trainings, the group doesn\u2019t endorse Republicans for federal offices because, Ms. Naughton said, \u201cwe can\u2019t justify supporting Republicans when the G.O.P. platform is aligned against scientific consensus on issues like climate change.\u201d)Elaine Luria, an engineer who operated nuclear reactors in the Navy, flipped Virginia\u2019s Second Congressional District, which had been represented by a Republican for 16 of the last 20 years. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician, won Washington\u2019s Eighth District, which had never elected a Democrat. Sean Casten, a biochemist, defeated a six-term Republican incumbent in the Sixth District of Illinois. T.J. Cox, a chemical engineer, won in California; Chrissy Houlahan, also an engineer, in Pennsylvania; Lauren Underwood, a registered nurse, in Illinois; and Jeff Van Drew, a dentist, in New Jersey.At least three Republicans with science or medical backgrounds, and starkly different views, also won House seats: Mark Green of Tennessee, a former Army physician; Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, a businessman with a degree in aerospace engineering; and John Joyce of Pennsylvania, a dermatologist.In several of the districts that flipped, science was at the very center of the campaign. 314 Action spent $500,000 on advertising in Mr. Cunningham\u2019s race, hammering the offshore drilling issue, and it was largely based on that issue that Mr. Cunningham received endorsements from several local Republican officials. The same issue resonated in coastal Virginia, where Ms. Luria said she \u201cdid not meet a single person on the campaign trail, regardless of political affiliation, who wants offshore drilling off of our coast.\u201dFor Mr. Casten \u2014 a former cancer researcher with degrees in molecular biology, biochemistry and biochemical engineering \u2014 the big issue involved Sterigenics, a company that sterilizes medical equipment at a facility in Willowbrook, Ill. The plant uses a carcinogenic chemical called ethylene oxide, and a Department of Health and Human Services report released in August found a high risk of cancer in nearby communities. (Sterigenics said the report had \u201cpurposefully relied upon a worst-case scenario for assessing risk.\u201d)ImageSean Casten, a biochemist, defeated a six-term Republican incumbent in the Illinois\u2019s Sixth District.CreditBrian Hill/Daily Herald, via Associated PressThe report became a liability for the incumbent Republican, Peter Roskam, who had received campaign contributions from the American Chemistry Council. The council and Sterigenics had been lobbying the E.P.A. for several years not to classify ethylene oxide as a known human carcinogen, and Mr. Roskam \u2014 whose spokeswoman declined to make him available for an interview \u2014 had supported legislation to put industry representatives on the E.P.A. boards that make such decisions.Now that they are in Washington, the Democratic scientists-turned-representatives face a new challenge. Many of them said that, beyond addressing climate change and other science-related issues, they wanted to bring a more scientific mind-set to Congress.For the last six years, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology was led by Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican with no scientific background. Under him, the committee investigated the debunked idea that global warming had \u201cpaused,\u201d subpoenaed organizations whose research affirmed the reality of climate change, and promoted rules that reduced the number of scientists and increased the number of industry representatives on E.P.A. advisory panels. At times, committee members showed a basic lack of scientific knowledge: During a hearing in 2014, Steve Stockman, another Texas Republican, said it was nonsensical to think melting glaciers and ice sheets would increase sea levels because glasses don\u2019t overflow when the ice cubes in them melt.Mr. Smith has now retired, and four other Republicans on the committee were not re-elected. The new chairwoman, Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Texas Democrat and former psychiatric nurse, is the first person with a scientific background to hold that position since the 1990s. Ms. Johnson said in an interview that she had invited the new scientists to join, though committee assignments may not be finalized for several weeks.But the old dynamics are not going to disappear.There will continue to be tension even with some of the scientists on the other side of the aisle: Mr. Hern, the aerospace engineer elected in Oklahoma, has questioned whether human activity is the primary cause of climate change, and Mr. Green, the doctor from Tennessee, repeated the debunked claim that vaccines can cause autism. (He later backtracked, telling HuffPost that children should be vaccinated.) They, too, feel their experience gives them a more authoritative voice and, in Mr. Hern\u2019s words, \u201can understanding of many of the issues that others might not have.\u201dRepresentative Don Beyer of Virginia, a Democrat on the science committee, acknowledged that eight people could not \u201cchange the entire culture.\u201d But, he said, they could change Congress\u2019s perspective.ImageElaine Luria, an engineer who operated nuclear reactors in the Navy, flipped Virginia\u2019s Second Congressional District, which has been represented by a Republican for 16 of the past 20 years.CreditErin Schaff for The New York Times\u201cSo often, our perspective of politicians is lawyers and people with the gift of gab,\u201d Mr. Beyer said. \u201cNow we\u2019re getting people that have a deep knowledge of mathematics and physics and chemistry and biology, and that\u2019s a really important perspective in an increasingly scientific world.\u201dMr. Cunningham is already preparing a bill that would ban drilling off the Atlantic coast for 10 years. Mr. Beyer and Bill Foster \u2014 an Illinois Democrat and physicist who is the only member of Congress with a doctorate in a scientific field \u2014 described several other legislative priorities for the committee, including more oversight of the E.P.A. and other science-related government bodies; regulation of developing technologies like human genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies and mobile payments; and, of course, measures to combat climate change. One of the first may be carbon pricing legislation \u2014 which would charge corporations for their carbon emissions \u2014 because unlike more aggressive measures, Mr. Foster said he believed that might get through the Republican-led Senate.Mr. Foster said he believed Mr. Casten would be particularly helpful on carbon pricing. With experience in both biochemistry and business, Mr. Casten can \u201creally talk about the nuts and bolts about what it means,\u201d he said, \u201cand how different industry sectors will react to that, and how that\u2019s going to affect the carbon footprint of different industries, in a quantitative way.\u201dUltimately, that sort of subject expertise, more than the Sisyphean task of changing the congressional approach to science, may be the new members\u2019 most immediate contribution.While talking about Ms. Luria, a nuclear engineer, Mr. Foster recalled the congressional discussion of the Iran nuclear agreement, which included a page describing the technical changes Iran needed to make to its reactor cores to ensure that the reactors could not produce large quantities of weapons-grade plutonium.\u201cDemocrats and Republicans were coming to me in this period saying, \u2018Bill, what does this mean and how should I vote on it?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWith Elaine there, at least that will cut my workload in half. We\u2019ll have two competent members who can talk about reactor cores.\u201d"}, {"title": "Robotic Milkers and an Automated Greenhouse: Inside a High-Tech Small Farm", "category": "Business", "id": "22673ab9-8b23-4be0-bbc8-df2ba8e40bd6", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/technology/farm-technology-milkers-robots.html", "publishdate": 20190113, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/08/business/08farmtech07-promo/08farmtech07-promo-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "content": "SectionsSkip to contentSkip to site index"}, {"title": "How Fiat Chrysler Sped From Laggard to Leader in Detroit", "category": "Business", "id": "5f0ddbbc-592d-4d29-9383-541d3482fd71", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/business/fiat-chrysler-detroit-auto-show.html", "publishdate": 20190114, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/15/business/15FIAT/15FIAT-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "DETROIT \u2014 A decade ago, Chrysler was the weakest of the three Detroit automakers and staved off collapse with the help of a government-backed bankruptcy. Today, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles appears to be the sturdiest by many measures, in large part because it stopped making sedans well before its competitors.The company\u2019s chief executive, Mike Manley, said Monday that Fiat Chrysler was strong enough that it no longer needed a merger or an alliance \u2014 options it was pursuing as recently as a year ago.\u201cWe went from survival mode in 2009 to a level of stability with a balance sheet and resources that we have never enjoyed in the past,\u201d Mr. Manley told reporters at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. \u201cWe are now in a position where we can deliver on our next five years as an independent company.\u201dBy leaving the car business, where many companies are losing money, Fiat Chrysler was able to pour resources into higher-margin and better-selling sport utility vehicles and trucks. In 2018, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s sales in the United States increased 9 percent, powered by its Jeep brand, while the overall market was flat and domestic sales fell at General Motors, Ford Motor, Toyota and other big producers.G.M. and Ford are only now scrambling to cut jobs, increase profits and follow Fiat Chrysler out of the passenger-car business. G.M. recently idled three car and two engine factories in North America in an effort to shed 14,000 jobs.Ford last spring said it would stop making popular sedans like the Fusion, the Focus and the Taurus while moving resources into new S.U.V.s and electric vehicles. And on Tuesday, Ford and Volkswagen are expected to announce the outlines of an alliance that is meant to help the companies slash costs.\u201cThey look like geniuses now,\u201d Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader, said of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s strategy shift.Fiat Chrysler still faces plenty of challenges. Its Dodge and Chrysler brands score below average in quality surveys and offer fewer models than many of the company\u2019s competitors. The company has invested a lot less in autonomous and electric vehicles than its rivals, a decision that could hurt Fiat Chrysler in the future. In addition, the company has much lower profit margins in the rest of the world than in North America.Mr. Manley said he was confident that Fiat Chrysler could address those problems. The company, for example, plans to introduce more hybrid and electric models. But Mr. Manley said he saw no justification for an aggressive push into electric cars because most automakers aside from Tesla have struggled to sell those cars in large numbers.He also noted that he would not rule out mergers or alliances. \u201cIt would be foolhardy to say I wouldn\u2019t be interested in a partnership that improves our position,\u201d he noted.Fiat Chrysler\u2019s move out of passenger cars was masterminded by Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat chief executive who took control of Chrysler after its 2009 bankruptcy, and merged the two companies.Mr. Marchionne spent heavily to develop a car, the Chrysler 200, that could compete with popular models like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, and a small car, the Dodge Dart, for the American market. The 200 became the star of an iconic Super Bowl ad in 2011 that played up vehicles \u201cimported from Detroit\u201d and became a symbol of Chrysler\u2019s comeback.In 2015, concluding that Fiat Chrysler was not profitable enough to survive on its own, Mr. Marchionne proposed a merger with G.M. After he was rebuffed, he explored deals with Chinese automakers and others. At the time, the company\u2019s North American profit margin was well below Ford\u2019s and G.M.\u2019s. Sales of the 200 and Dart were foundering, too, as low gas prices enticed American consumers to gravitate toward fuel-guzzling S.U.V.s.Mr. Marchionne discontinued the 200 and Dart, and retooled factories producing those models to make trucks and Jeeps. Many analysts warned that Fiat Chrysler was making a risky bet that could backfire when gas prices started rising again.Mr. Marchionne died unexpectedly last year after shoulder surgery and was succeeded by Mr. Manley.The new chief executive said the exit from sedans had laid the foundation for the company\u2019s resurgence. The Sterling Heights, Mich., plant that made the Chrysler 200 was barely making money when production ceased in 2016. Today, it makes the redesigned Ram pickup truck. Without revealing precise figures, Mr. Manley said the plant was now highly profitable.The new Ram is taking market share from Ford and G.M. in the lucrative full-size pickup segment. The company says more large vehicles are on the way. The new Jeep Gladiator pickup has just arrived in showrooms and will be followed by two large S.U.V.s \u2014 the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. Fiat Chrysler expects to add at least 2,000 workers at a Detroit factory.Not having any sedans to offer customers \u201chas been a nonissue,\u201d said Mark Scarpelli, an owner of Chrysler franchises in northern Illinois. \u201cThe consumer has all but forgotten the 200 and Dart, and the new Ram and Jeep are very strong, very well received.\u201d"}, {"title": "Democrats Want to Run on Issues in 2020.

A federal jobs guarantee. The \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d No Super PAC money. No mass deportations.And, of course, a candidate who can beat President Trump \u2014 right?After a 2018 midterm election that energized the left, perhaps the most consequential political question facing the Democratic Party is whether liberals will insist on imposing policy litmus tests on 2020 presidential hopefuls, or whether voters will rally behind the candidate most capable of defeating the president even if that Democrat is imperfect on some issues.These dual priorities \u2014 and which one is emphasized more in the coming primary races \u2014 will help determine how the party approaches 2020. Will candidates sprint to the left on issues and risk hurting themselves with intraparty policy fights and in the general election? Or will they keep the focus squarely on Mr. Trump and possibly disappoint liberals by not being bolder on policy?The two paths may help determine the electoral fortunes of potential left-wing candidates like Senator Bernie Sanders and more moderate ones like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., as well as Democrats like Senator Kamala Harris and Beto O\u2019Rourke who have a history of appealing to both liberals and moderates and drawing ire from some leftists for not being aggressive enough on policy.Senator Elizabeth Warren showed one way of dealing with these party tensions on her first campaign swing as a presidential candidate to Iowa this month. Ms. Warren chose not to talk about Medicare for All, a signature issue for the ascendant left. But she seized every opportunity before overwhelmingly white audiences to highlight challenges facing people of color.In doing so, Ms. Warren signaled to voters that she believes addressing matters of race and identity will prove as crucial to winning over Democrats as proving her bona fides on every element of economic populism.If opposing the Iraq War was the crucial red line for Democratic candidates in 2008, many in the party believe that proving oneself as the antidote to Mr. Trump and his brand of incendiary politics will become the ultimate litmus test in 2020, more than demonstrating policy purity. Yet some activists want both: fierce resistance to Mr. Trump and unwavering fidelity to the left\u2019s catechism of issues.Representative Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who is eying a Senate race in 2020, said that while many voters will expect the presidential hopefuls to meet threshold tests of being progressive, the most important factors in the race are going to be an ability to inspire the party\u2019s voters and defeat Mr. Trump.\u201cI don\u2019t believe the electorate is going to be so purist that they\u2019re going to knock somebody out because they\u2019re not 100 percent down-the-line,\u201d said Mr. Gallego, who added, \u201cPeople are excited about candidates they think have a potential to win.\u201dImageSome liberals want both a fierce resistance to President Trump and unwavering fidelity to the left\u2019s catechism of issues.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesOr, as Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland put it: \u201cIf there\u2019s a litmus test, it\u2019s going to be righting the country.\u201dVoters, said Mr. Cummings, \u201care scared.\u201dThis is exactly what alarms some on the left, who do not want the perceived threat of Mr. Trump and horse race political concerns to undercut major policy priorities.\u201cFear is a useful tactic to override underlying ideological debate,\u201d said Matt Stoller, a populist writer and former congressional aide, recalling that similar emotions about finding \u201celectable\u201d Democrats in the George W. Bush era led the party to embrace moderate politicians and policies to the frustration of many on the left.As Mr. Stoller noted, much of the recent left-wing criticism against Mr. O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas representative, was rooted in the dread that his nomination would represent a triumph of he-can-win, personality-based politics \u2014 and that he would mark a continuation of the incremental economic policies of the last two Democratic presidents, rather than a break from them.When many on the left listen to Mr. O\u2019Rourke or Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, another likely candidate, plead for a better kind of politics or a healing of the country after Mr. Trump, they hear an Obama-style call for stylistic change rather than a case for truly confronting entrenched power.\u201cWe tried that, and it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Stoller said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pretty obvious to everybody now that it didn\u2019t work.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s fixation on immigration only makes it easier for a would-be candidate like Mr. O\u2019Rourke to skirt questions about his specific policy views and instead draw broad contrasts between himself and the president on issues related to the border and the character of the country, as he has done on social media in recent days.He and Ms. Warren are not the only potential contenders road-testing a message that spotlights their differences with the president.\u201cTrump is a lying populist; Democrats need an optimistic realist,\u201d said former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, who is considering a presidential run and trumpets his progressive record on race, gender and sexual orientation but believes that Democrats must resist the temptation of lashing the business community.\u201cWe can\u2019t go through this campaign demonizing folks,\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said.Another question ahead of 2020 is which candidate will be able to portray himself or herself most effectively as the antidote to Trump and Trumpism. Will this contrast be rendered most vividly by nominating a candidate whose platform differs from the president\u2019s policies the most; one who can speak most articulately about changing course; or one who \u2014 through age, gender or race \u2014 represents the starkest departure from the president?ImagePotential Democratic candidates like Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman, could pursue a wide range of voters from the middle and the left in a presidential campaign.CreditTodd Heisler/The New York TimesIn the midterms, Democratic primary voters rallied behind a historic number of female congressional candidates who spanned the party\u2019s ideological gamut.And some Democratic strategists believe that the only real issue-based tests that primary voters will put to candidates revolve around matters of race and identity.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can be for stop-and-frisk in a primary,\u201d said Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster, referring to the policing tactic of Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, that critics say targets black people. \u201cIt\u2019s less about economic issues than culture and issues of the heart.\u201dYet to supporters of Mr. Sanders and some others on the left, it is folly to assume that voter hunger to defeat Mr. Trump will somehow obviate the need to offer a bold economic agenda. In their eyes, pursuing an aggressive populist agenda is essential to proving to voters that you will confront Mr. Trump.\u201cThe party is in a different place \u2014 we need somebody to stand up and defend our core progressive values,\u201d Ben Tulchin, Mr. Sanders\u2019s pollster, said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re waffling on key issues like Medicare for All, or if you lack clarity on it because you want to give yourself flexibility in governing, voters will see that.\u201dThis moment, said Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, will require a candidate who sounds clarion opposition to Mr. Trump on race and gender while also embracing a full-spectrum, left-wing agenda.\u201cIt has to be somebody who is really willing to take on race, racism and immigration, but also is willing to take on these big corporations in a way that just hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d said Ms. Jayapal, a rising member of the House\u2019s Progressive Caucus.To strategists who worked on the 2018 midterms, however, the enormous attention being paid to a handful of outspoken liberals like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York misses the nonideological approach of many of the party\u2019s successful candidates for governor and Congress.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a demand among Democratic primary voters for litmus tests,\u201d said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster.And Ms. Greenberg, who is working for former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, a possible 2020 candidate, contends that electoral viability will be more central in the coming Democratic presidential primary than in any recent election.\u201cTrump has framed our politics,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is a reaction to Trump.\u201dOr, as Mr. Belcher put it: \u201cThis anger about our divisions and where our country is going will be front and center \u2014 and the candidate who can speak to this division and be a direct contrast to Trump is going to do really well.\u201d"}, {"title": "No Coincidence Here: Trump\u2019s Bezos Attack Was a Valentine to The Enquirer", "category": "Business", "id": "dc10a344-5f04-4c90-8802-610f1aae697b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/business/media/trump-bezos-national-enquirer-pecker-twitter.html", "publishdate": 20190114, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/15/business/15rutenberg/15rutenberg-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Even by the tweeting habits of the 45th president of the United States, it was a puzzler.Until you examined it. Then it started to make sense.A Twitter post on Sunday night showed Mr. Trump \u2014 in the middle of the longest federal government shutdown in American history \u2014 reveling in the lurid revelations surrounding the impending divorce of Jeff Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Bezos.In attacking the founder and chief executive of Amazon, President Trump praised The National Enquirer for publishing an article in its Jan. 28 edition with the all-caps headline: \u201cBEZOS\u2019 DIVORCE! THE CHEATING PHOTOS THAT ENDED HIS MARRIAGE.\u201dIn the same tweet \u2014 which made use of the sarcasm and schoolyard-style nicknaming that has endeared him to his base of supporters \u2014 the president saw fit to insult The Washington Post, the newspaper Mr. Bezos has owned since 2013.\u201cSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post.\u201dMr. Trump has attacked Mr. Bezos, Amazon and the newspaper since his presidential campaign, suggesting in the most un-Republican of ways \u2014 and falsely \u2014 that Mr. Bezos uses the newspaper as a lobbying arm to stave off higher taxes and antitrust enforcement for Amazon. To hammer home his unfounded theory, the president has referred to the paper as the Amazon Washington Post more than a dozen times since 2015, although Mr. Bezos, not the company, is the owner.That Mr. Trump would slap a childish sobriquet on a man he perceives as a threat is not news. (See Schiff, Adam, whose name the president spun into a vulgarity in a November tweet.) Nor is it news that he went after The Post \u2014 a newspaper that has been a thorough and aggressive chronicler of his presidency and the various investigations it has drawn.The news contained in the tweet on Sunday was something that, at first glance, may not seem like news at all: his praise for The Enquirer.Sure, The Enquirer turned itself into an effective cheering squad and opposition research shop for Mr. Trump before, during and after the presidential campaign. As part of the effort, the tabloid\u2019s owner, American Media Inc., arranged to effectively silence Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump, with a $150,000 payout. And David J. Pecker, the chairman of American Media, was famously close to Mr. Trump.Emphasis on \u201cwas.\u201dIn recent weeks, Mr. Pecker has emerged as a cooperating witness in the federal investigation that prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are pursuing into the schemes to pay six figures to Ms. McDougal and Stormy Daniels, another woman whose story of an affair with Mr. Trump was buried by the company.In the Sunday-night tweet, Mr. Trump was effectively vouching for the credibility of Mr. Pecker and his newspaper \u2014 whose name in the Trump era hasn\u2019t exactly been equated with accuracy. To wit, Hillary Clinton is still alive, proving that The Enquirer\u2019s campaign-year reports of her imminent death were a bit of an exaggeration.Mr. Pecker\u2019s word is of high value to prosecutors \u2014 and highly dangerous to Mr. Trump.Mr. Pecker provided vital corroboration for the story told by Mr. Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, when he pleaded guilty last year to arranging the payments to Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal.Mr. Cohen said he had arranged them with the full knowledge that they were equivalent to illegal campaign disbursements, because they were intended to help Mr. Trump win the election. He also said he had made the payments at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction, essentially accusing his former boss of being the driving force behind the whole thing.In December, Mr. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison on those charges and others. In a court filing provided ahead of that sentencing, the New York prosecutors disclosed the extent of American Media\u2019s cooperation. The company\u2019s willingness to help is why there have been no charges against those involved with the running of the tabloid, prosecutors said.The cooperation of American Media officers was highly significant, because Mr. Cohen made for a flawed witness. His long track record of lies meant anything he said to law enforcement officials would require corroboration, if it were to be of any real value.After months of public denials that the payment to Ms. McDougal had been coordinated with Mr. Trump or Mr. Cohen, American Media flipped the script, telling prosecutors that it had coughed up the cash \u201cin cooperation, consultation and concert with, and at the request and suggestion of, one or more members or agents of\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. The publisher also explained why it had done so \u2014 so that Ms. McDougal \u201cdid not publicize damaging allegations\u201d and \u201cthereby influence that election.\u201dFurther placing Mr. Trump at the center of the scheme, American Media told prosecutors that all the way back in August 2015, Mr. Pecker had met with Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen and \u201coffered to help deal with negative stories about that presidential candidate\u2019s relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided.\u201d Mr. Cohen was Mr. Trump\u2019s point man in the effort.That helped bolster the argument that Mr. Trump was effectively an unindicted co-conspirator, making Mr. Cohen, in Trump parlance \u2014 as well as that of Al Capone \u2014 \u201ca rat.\u201dThat\u2019s why the unreported speculation on cable news and social media last week that The Enquirer\u2019s coverage of Mr. Bezos had been cooked up between Mr. Trump and American Media seemed out of whack to those of us who have covered the story.If facts come to light confirming that such a collaboration existed, it will be another jaw-dropper of a story. But for now, sans evidence, it seems that The Enquirer was fulfilling its traditional role of digging up dirt on the rich and famous when it went after Mr. Bezos.The president had other reasons to compliment the paper, however. American Media\u2019s agreement with prosecutors extends for three years \u2014 and Mr. Pecker, as we\u2019ve reported, is sitting on decades of Trump dirt that it refrained from publishing during the campaign. That means that he remains someone the president may want to keep on his good side, despite their recent differences. It\u2019s worth noting that Mr. Trump has not publicly called Mr. Pecker a \u201cco-rat,\u201d at least so far.And there is this key dictum of Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of politics: The enemy of my enemy is my friend, if only for a news cycle."}, {"title": "Fake News as \u2018Moral Imperative\u2019?

Trump.The Russian news outlet Sputnik jumped on the news, saying last week that the Alabama operation \u201cseems to cast Democrats\u2019 Russiagate accusations into further doubt.\u201dAlso getting in on the action was RT, the Kremlin-financed news organization once known as Russia Today. \u201cThe only \u2018Russian bots\u2019 to meddle in U.S. elections,\u201d the network reported, \u201cbelonged to Democrat-linked experts.\u201dThe disinformation campaign in Alabama included a scheme to produce false evidence that Russian Twitter bots were working to elect Mr. Moore. After the revelations first came to light, John Griffing, a former executive director of the Harris County Republican Party in Texas, appeared on RT to go after the Democrats.\u201cI\u2019ve always been suspicious that the Russia-bot narrative was flimsy and probably made up,\u201d Mr. Griffing told RT viewers. \u201cSimply because that\u2019s the kind of thing the Democratic Party does \u2014 they make things up in order to create the basis for an attack on the right wing.\u201dIn addition to giving Russia new ammunition in its defense against election-meddling allegations, the progressives\u2019 political caper in Alabama sent a chilling message to the rest of us: Reality-warping attacks are now coming from inside the house.ImageJonathon Morgan, of the cyber security firm New Knowledge, was one of the people involved in the Moore disinformation campaign. He has minimized the effort, saying it was only an experiment to observe how such Russian-style tactics work in real time.CreditNew KnowledgeIf the trend intensifies, the 2020 presidential campaign will make the media shenanigans of 2016 seem genteel.Sputnik and RT were keying off two articles in The New York Times, which broke the news of the Alabama efforts. The first, by Scott Shane and Alan Blinder in late December, detailed an operation that included the creation of fake Russian Twitter accounts, as well as a phony Facebook page purportedly set up by conservative Alabamians opposed to Mr. Moore, who ended up losing to his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones.One of the people behind that effort, Jonathon Morgan, of the cyber security firm New Knowledge, minimized the effort by saying it was only an experiment to observe how such Russian-style tactics work in real time (though an internal report said the project was seeking to depress turnout for Mr. Moore).The main financial backer of that project, the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, disavowed it, saying he did not know the money he had donated to groups affiliated with Democrats would finance such a thing. \u201cI want to be unequivocal,\u201d he wrote on Medium. \u201cThere is absolutely no place in our democracy for manipulating facts or using falsehoods to gain political power.\u201dMr. Jones, the politician who benefited from the operation, angrily denounced it and called for a federal investigation. So maybe there was reason to think it was all just a blip.Then came the second Times article, last week, on another shady tactic used against Mr. Moore. This one involved a Facebook page for a fake group of Baptists supporting Mr. Moore as a potential ally in their bid to ban alcohol in Alabama \u2014 a surefire way to alienate voters if ever there was one.The phony teetotaling campaign was the work of another group of liberal activists with different financiers, whose identities remain unknown. And it came with an implicit warning: Get used to it.ImageThe main financial backer of the Alabama project, the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, disavowed it, saying he did not know the money he had donated to groups affiliated with Democrats would finance such a thing.CreditJason Henry for The New York TimesAs one of the organizers, the progressive activist Matt Osborne, told The Times, \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it, you\u2019re fighting with one hand tied behind your back.\u201d Given the way some of Mr. Trump\u2019s backers \u2014 here and in Russia \u2014 have engaged in such tactics, he said, there was \u201ca moral imperative to do this.\u201dResearchers who have been studying the Russian disinformation tactics have been girding for just such a development.\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve been talking about in the last year is how the real threat\u2019s going to be when it\u2019s not just Russia or Iran \u2014 nation-states with budgets \u2014 but when every single person with an issue starts engaging in this type of manipulative behavior,\u201d said Bret Schafer, an analyst at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a research project at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely awful for democracy.\u201dMr. Schafer had particular reason to be chagrined. New Knowledge helped build the website for the Alliance\u2019s disinformation-tracking database, Hamilton68, which had monitored suspected Russian-linked accounts, tracking the falsehoods they spread and the discord they tried to sow. (New Knowledge also helped write a report on Russian troll activity released last month by the Senate Intelligence Committee.) The Alabama project, Mr. Schafer told me, \u201cundercuts our collective ability to take other countries to task for their deceptive, online behavior.\u201dFight-fire-with-fire reasoning is bubbling up on the left as the social media giants continue to struggle to stop distortion campaigns in real time. It was only after The Times and The Washington Post reported on the Alabama operations that Facebook shut down the suspect accounts.None of this bodes well for the 2020 campaign, which has entered its first stage at a time when analysts in and out of government are still trying to determine the full effect disinformation had in the last presidential election.Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has concluded that the Russian activity probably affected the outcome. In \u201cCyber War,\u201d her just-published book about the 2016 campaign, she reports that Russia \u201ctried to mobilize, demobilize, and shift the sorts of voters that Trump needed to win.\u201dImageThe Democrat Doug Jones, after his victory in the Alabama Senate race.CreditJohnathon Kelso for The New York TimesIf the results of the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III confirm her conclusion, some people may be deterred from employing such tactics. On the other hand, nothing spawns copycats like victory.Big questions remain about how to keep American political campaigns from descending into disinformation, barring still-elusive legal or technical remedies, as Ms. Jamieson told me in an interview. \u201cHow do you make sure it\u2019s marked off as inappropriate?\u201d she said. \u201cThe real question for 2020 is, what is out of bounds? Is there anything?\u201dAs a start, I reached out to various expected 2020 players to see if they would eschew such tactics.I was heartened to receive this statement from Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey: \u201cThere is no place in our politics for deceptive tactics that undermine trust in \u2014 and the credibility of \u2014 our democratic process and stand in contrast to our values.\u201dSenator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential exploratory committee said, \u201cOur campaign doesn\u2019t support these kinds of tactics.\u201d The campaign manager for Representative Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s 2020 committee, Rania Batrice, said Ms. Gabbard \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the use of disinformation.The Republican Party chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel \u2014 sounding as if she might be relishing the Democrats\u2019 turn under the microscope \u2014 said, \u201cThese tactics are shameful.\u201dThen there were those whose offices I never heard back from \u2014 Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Juli\u00e1n Castro, the Democratic Party itself and Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election team.The real surprise was former Vice President Joe Biden.\u201cNot going to have any comment on that for you,\u201d a spokesman said.Maybe Mr. Biden wants to keep his options open."}, {"title": "\u2018Everybody Counts in This Country\u2019: A Chat With Juli\u00e1n Castro", "category": "Politics", "id": "64eb1108-54c6-41a0-8a7f-7b3379cbc59c", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/on-politics-julian-castro-2020.html", "publishdate": 20190114, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/14/us/politics/14onpolitics-Castro/14onpolitics-Castro-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.[Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]He\u2019s running!Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary and former mayor of San Antonio, Tex., said on Saturday that he will run for president. The first major Latino candidate to make a 2020 bid, Mr. Castro, 44, advocated for a fairly progressive platform in his announcement speech.Here at On Politics, we\u2019re trying to talk to all the 2020 candidates as they enter the race, and Mr. Castro agreed to be our first subject. We spoke late Sunday afternoon, shortly after he landed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he planed to speak to a group of political activists and tour a hurricane recovery zone. (As usual, our conversation has been condensed for clarity.)ImageLisa: Hi. Thanks for chatting with us. As you well know, you\u2019re one of the first of what\u2019s likely to be quite a number of Democrats running for president. How can you distinguish yourself?Castro: I have a track record of getting things done as mayor of San Antonio and as secretary of housing. I have a strong vision for the country\u2019s future. And I\u2019ve lived a life that I believe lets me understand people all along the scale of experience in our country. I had a modest upbringing and I can understand people that are striving to reach their dreams. I\u2019ve also reached my dreams and can understand folks who have had a lot of success.You\u2019re in Puerto Rico right now. That\u2019s pretty far from Iowa. Why start your campaign there?I want everybody to understand that everybody counts in this country. The most basic tenet of government is protection. And this administration failed our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico by not protecting them after Hurricane Maria. I\u2019m going to highlight that, and then we\u2019ll let folks know that in the years to come everybody is going to count in this country, including the people of Puerto Rico.President Trump has said there\u2019s a massive crisis on the border. Do you agree?Not at all. The crisis that exists is a crisis of leadership. This president has failed. He promised all of us that if Americans could just be cruel enough to separate babies from their parents at the border, that it would deter more families from coming over there. Now we\u2019ve seen that more families are coming over. So he has failed with his policies, and he\u2019s failed in trying to convince the American people that he\u2019s not to blame for this shutdown. And the best thing that he can do now is to set aside his political ploy of the wall.You may be the only Latino in a crowded race. How do you think that will impact the contest?I\u2019ve got to be myself, and I\u2019m confident that I can appeal to a broad cross-section of Americans. At the same time, of course, there\u2019s significance to the Latino community because I believe a lot of Latinos feel targeted right now by this administration. For me, personally, I can relate to many of today\u2019s immigrants because my grandmother that I grew up with came over from Mexico, and I grew up in San Antonio, just a few hours away from the border. So I\u2019ve seen the positive value that immigrants add to this country in a very direct way. And I know that these cities along the border are some of the safest cities in the United States.Any Democrats who runs will have to answer the question of how to challenge Mr. Trump. What\u2019s your philosophy?The way I see it is that, above all else, people want to know what you stand for. I\u2019m going to give people a strong positive vision for our country\u2019s future. Of course, I\u2019m going to point out where I differ with the president. But my first priority is to let you know, if you elect me, what I\u2019m going to do for you or for your family.Do you think a Democrat will end up running against Mr. Trump? Like, do you think he\u2019ll still be in office next year? That\u2019s probably the best question out there now. You know, it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going to happen. My hope is that these investigations will proceed thoroughly and Congress will act once the investigation is finished appropriately. So right now, I\u2019m prepared to face President Trump in November of 2020. If there\u2019s somebody else who\u2019s up for the Republicans, then I\u2019ll face them.Mr. Trump is known for giving nicknames to his opponents. What do you think yours will be? Who knows and who cares. You know, the thing about magic tricks is that even magic tricks get old. And his tricks are getting old.[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.]____________________A T.S.A. family, hit by the shutdownImageDaniel and Jennifer Young and their twin daughters.Talks between the White House and congressional Democrats to end the longest government shutdown in history remained stalled on Monday. That\u2019s more bad news for government employees, who don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll get their next paycheck.Last week we spoke to J\u00falia Quintanilla, a contract janitor at the Department of Agriculture, who was worried about buying groceries. Today, we\u2019re bringing you the story of T.S.A. agents Daniel and Jennifer Young. The couple met on the job at Huntsville Municipal Airport in Alabama, where they\u2019ve both worked for over a decade. They stagger their shifts, with Ms. Young leaving the house around 3:30 a.m., so they can care for their 5-year-old twin daughters.Deemed essential for national security, T.S.A. agents are required to work during the shutdown. But they\u2019re not getting paid. Many live paycheck to paycheck, making an average salary of $35,000, according to officials at the American Federation of Government Employees.High numbers are calling in sick and resigning, a situation that\u2019s forced airports in Miami, Houston and Washington to close some screening lines. And on Sunday night, the T.S.A. confirmed that a passenger with a gun passed through a checkpoint in the Atlanta airport and flew to Tokyo. The agency denied any connection with the shutdown, but the incident sparked speculation.To ease some of the stress, David P. Pekoske, the T.S.A. administrator, announced that employees would receive a day\u2019s pay if they worked Dec. 22 and that uniformed officers will get a $500 bonus on Tuesday.So far, the Youngs have been able to stretch their finances to cover their expenses. But if the shutdown continues into next month, the couple said they will have to make some \u201creally hard choices\u201d about which bills to pay.\u201cWe had a screw in our tire, and I had to go and figure out how we\u2019re going to pay for it to get fixed,\u201d said Mr. Young, 36, a Marine Corps veteran. \u201cThat increases your stress level. You can\u2019t stop life when you\u2019re not getting paid. You still have to go to work.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t pay my electric bill with an i.o.u. I can\u2019t pay my mortgage with an i.o.u.,\u201d Mr. Young added. \u201cAll my decisions are based on the fact that I have no idea when I\u2019m going to get paid or how I\u2019m paying for this. I will be pretty much living off credit cards in February.\u201d\u201cKids sense a lot,\u201d said Ms. Young, 34, \u201cbut I feel like they don\u2019t need to know. It\u2019s my job to take care of them. It\u2019s my job to provide for them. Even if I have to make tough choices.

It said John Simon, the company\u2019s general counsel, would serve as interim chief executive during the search.\u201cWhile we are making progress as a company in safety and other areas, the board recognizes the tremendous challenges PG&E continues to face,\u201d said Richard C.

The sum would exceed its insurance and assets, raising concern in the state capital about the utility\u2019s future.The billions in potential costs have prompted a series of downgrades in PG&E\u2019s ratings, including decisions last week by Moody\u2019s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings to downgrade the utility\u2019s bonds to junk.The \u201caction is driven entirely by the further weakening of Pacific Gas and Electric Company\u2019s credit quality,\u201d Moody\u2019s stated in its decision.Gov. Gavin Newsom has said that responding to the utility and wildfire issues are among his top priorities after taking office last week.Fire investigators determined that PG&E\u2019s equipment was responsible for at least 18 of 21 major fires in 2017 as well as fires in 2018. Some of the fires have been attributed to power lines\u2019 coming into contact with trees, which critics have said is a result of the utility\u2019s failure to trim the trees.Senator Jerry Hill, a San Francisco Democrat who heads the State Senate\u2019s energy subcommittee on gas, electric and transportation safety, said the company needed to take steps to improve its operations as state and federal investigations have highlighted troubles with its safety culture.

And don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know where the money went,\u201d Mr. Lim said in an interview in Hong Kong on Monday. \u201cGoldman Sachs needs to come to terms with the facts.\u201dMalaysia is gearing up for a fight with an institution that was once synonymous with power and influence around the world. The government is seeking $7.5 billion in compensation from Goldman Sachs, adding to a mounting pile of penalties against the bank and deepening one of the most serious crises in its 149-year history.The crisis is expected to be the main focus for David M. Solomon, Goldman Sachs\u2019s recently appointed chief executive, when he announces the bank\u2019s fourth-quarter results this week.Goldman has found itself entangled in civil and criminal investigations around the world related to the work it did in helping 1Malaysia Development Berhad \u2014 or 1MDB, which United States prosecutors have alleged was a slush fund for the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak and other officials. New York regulators have issued subpoenas to some Goldman bankers, the bank has held talks with prosecutors about possible fines, and most recently, its lawyers in Malaysia reached out to the country\u2019s attorney general.Last month, Malaysia filed criminal charges against Goldman Sachs, accusing the bank of defrauding investors by raising more than $6 billion for 1MDB.Goldman Sachs has denied the charges and said that \u201ccertain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to Goldman Sachs.\u201d It has said it would \u201cvigorously contest\u201d the charges.\u201cUnder the Malaysian legal process, the firm was not afforded an opportunity to be heard prior to the filing of these charges against certain Goldman Sachs entities, which we intend to vigorously contest,\u201d the bank said in an emailed statement.In November, the Justice Department announced that it had secured a guilty plea from one former senior Goldman banker and filed bribery and money laundering charges against a second.Goldman has since said its dealings with 1MDB could still result in \u201csignificant fines, penalties and other sanctions.\u201dIn Malaysia, the scandal has gripped the nation and led to the unexpected ouster of Mr. Najib, handing power to Mahathir Mohamad, 93, a former prime minister and longtime politician.ImageNajib Razak, center, a former prime minister of Malaysia, is expected to be charged in relation to the 1MDB fraud.CreditFazry Ismail/EPA, via ShutterstockAt the heart of the scandal is the 1MDB fund, which Mr. Najib created in the name of raising money for development projects to benefit Malaysians. Instead, prosecutors have alleged, billions of dollars were siphoned off into the personal accounts of Mr. Najib, other officials and a flamboyant Malaysian financier known as Jho Low.Under Mr. Mahathir, the new government is trying to recover some of the billions that disappeared and subsequently burned a big hole in the government\u2019s finances.\u201cYou look at the agony that Malaysia had to endure \u2014 not just in terms of the figures but the trauma,\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cYou must have a heart. Sometimes you ask, does Goldman have a heart?\u201dHe also said Malaysia would be ready to walk away from an ambitious railway project that started under Mr. Najib and was promoted as a showcase deal in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. The initiative, an enormous infrastructure plan financed by China, includes countries across Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.\u201cAll options are on the table,\u201d Mr. Lim said, adding that a decision would be made in the coming weeks.Last summer, citing the high costs of the deal, Malaysia halted a contract for the China Communications Construction Company to build an East Coast Rail Link, a rail line linking vast swaths of the country.Representatives from the Chinese side have been negotiating with Malaysian counterparts to revive the deal. Under the current terms, officials in Kuala Lumpur estimate that Malaysia would be making annual interest payments of 2 billion ringgit, roughly $488 million, a person with direct knowledge of the government\u2019s estimates said. The rail, once built, is also expected to lose about $122 million a year, that person said.Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials had offered to help bail Mr. Najib out of a growing debt hole related to 1MDB in exchange for stakes in the East Coast Rail Link and a pipeline project.Chinese officials also offered to get the United States and other countries to drop their early investigations into 1MDB in exchange, The Journal reported, citing documents and the minutes of meetings between Chinese and Malaysian officials.The China Communications Construction Company did not respond to an emailed request for comment.Mr. Lim said the Malaysian government was looking into the allegations.\u201cFor us to be able to initiate any investigation, we need the documents,\u201d he said, adding that the government had sought documents from The Journal.The revelations could add to tensions among Malaysia, the United States and China at a time when Malaysia is hoping to raise money through the bond market and strike new deals. The United States has grown increasingly skeptical of China\u2019s One Belt One Road campaign, which it sees as a campaign for political influence overseas.Mr. Lim sought to play down rising tensions.\u201cYou have to look past these instances,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like Goldman Sachs is an outlier and doesn\u2019t reflect the entire financial industry in the United States, it is similar for this case vis a vis China.\u201d"}, {"title": "PG&E Bankruptcy Tests Who Will Pay for California Wildfires", "category": "Business", "id": "3235b9d3-5266-44a5-9d59-a0887151946c", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/business/energy-environment/pge-bankruptcy-california.html", "publishdate": 20190114, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/15/business/15utlity2/15utlity2-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Pacific Gas and Electric said on Monday that it would seek bankruptcy protection as \u201cthe only viable option\u201d as the giant California utility faces billions of dollars in liability claims from two years of deadly wildfires.The company\u2019s troubles pose a challenge to the state\u2019s elected officials and regulators, who will ultimately decide whether part of the solution will be raising already high electricity rates. The problems could also make it harder to achieve California\u2019s ambitious goals for renewable energy.Experts said PG&E\u2019s predicament could be an early indicator of a wider economic toll from climate change, which is making wildfires more frequent and destructive. At the same time, the financial straits could handicap the utility\u2019s ability to step up the kind of preventive measures it has been faulted for neglecting, like trimming trees and brush around power lines and transformers.For Gov. Gavin Newsom, who took office last week, the bankruptcy disrupts an agenda that until now had focused on early childhood education, paid parental leave and the expansion of the state\u2019s health care program to cover more undocumented residents.Mr. Newsom said Monday that he had been \u201cin constant contact throughout the week and over the weekend\u201d with the company and regulators. \u201cEveryone\u2019s immediate focus is, rightfully, on ensuring Californians have continuous, reliable and safe electric and gas service,\u201d he said.Fire investigators determined PG&E to be the cause of at least 17 of 21 major Northern California fires in 2017. It is also suspected in some of the 2018 wildfires that have been described as the worst in state history, including one that killed at least 86 people and destroyed the town of Paradise.PG&E said it faced an estimated $30 billion liability for damages from the two years of wildfires, a sum that would exceed its insurance and assets. The bankruptcy announcement, in a filing with federal regulators, led the company\u2019s shares to plunge more than 50 percent.The shares had already lost almost two-thirds of their value since a wave of wildfires in early November, and its bond rating had been downgraded to junk status by two rating agencies.California\u2019s utilities have been seeking favorable regulatory and legislative support to guard themselves against wildfire liability \u2014 but none more than PG&E, the primary gas and electricity supplier to the northern half of California, serving about 16 million customers over 70,000 square miles.After intense lobbying, the state\u2019s investor-owned utilities, which include Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric, won a legislative shield from having to bear the cost of 2017 fires. The law allows them to pass the cost of wildfires to their customers in the form of higher rates.Now they are seeking the same for last year\u2019s fires. State law requires them to compensate property owners for fire damage caused by their equipment, regardless of whether negligence is proved.Consumer and environmental groups called the bankruptcy decision part of a series of threats and pressure by PG&E on lawmakers and the governor to give the company whatever it wants. \u201cIt\u2019s high brinkmanship with the Legislature,\u201d said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy organization. \u201cI think it\u2019s about hostage taking.\u201dThe utility companies acknowledge that they may bear some responsibility for wildfires but say not all of it, because climate change and development in remote areas have made blazes more destructive.Climate Change Is Fueling Wildfires Nationwide, New Report WarnsGlobal warming has already resulted in more forest fires out West, according to the latest National Climate Assessment. The future could see more of the country burn.Indeed, energy experts said PG&E\u2019s intention to file for bankruptcy was one of the first major financial casualties from climate change \u2014 and far from the last.Rising global temperatures driven by man-made greenhouse gas emissions are drying out Western forests and leading to more intense and long-burning wildfires. But that\u2019s just one of the risks that utilities and other major entities are starting to confront.The National Climate Assessment, a broad government report on climate change released last year, found that every part of the country\u2019s energy infrastructure will be stressed by droughts, heat waves, rising seas and fiercer storms.\u201cToday PG&E is confronting this risk from wildfires,\u201d said Michael Wara, director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University. \u201cTomorrow it could be insurance companies or state governments that are overwhelmed after an unexpectedly intense hurricane or series of hurricanes.\u201dImagePG&E\u2019s financial straits could handicap its ability to step up the kind of preventive measures it has been faulted for neglecting, like trimming trees and brush around power lines and transformers.CreditTalia Herman for The New York TimesSome see an opportunity for Mr. Newsom in the current crisis to mitigate future fire risks by requiring more safeguards for power lines, like burying them underground.The California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates PG&E, could play a key role. Mr. Newsom has a vacancy to fill on the commission, and he could make his appointee its president, potentially determining whether the agency will tilt toward consumers or the utilities in its approach.The company\u2019s safety culture has been under scrutiny since it was found at fault in a natural-gas explosion in 2010 that devastated the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno and killed eight people. PG&E was fined a record $1.6 billion by the state for failing to maintain its pipeline system properly, and it paid $900 million to resolve lawsuits related to the explosion.Mr. Newsom said Monday that because the utility had misled regulators after accidents like that one, his approach to dealing with PG&E was trust but verify.The company, he said, \u201chas not been a trusted player in the past.\u201dPublic anger over the utility\u2019s efforts to shield itself from wildfire liability boiled over at a November meeting of the commission, which protesters disrupted with chants and signs reading, \u201cNo PG&E bailout!\u201dPG&E will need the commission\u2019s approval for any bankruptcy plan that would impose new costs on ratepayers. One possibility is that another utility company would take over all or parts of its business.Part of the company\u2019s reorganization will include replacing its chief executive, Geisha Williams, who had led the corporation since 2017. On Sunday, PG&E announced her departure and a search to fill her job, which for the interim will be held by John Simon, the company\u2019s general counsel.The bankruptcy will allow PG&E to renegotiate its contracts with its electricity suppliers, which could hurt solar and wind farms that might struggle to make money and repay debts if they are forced to accept lower prices.The announcement may also lead to more calls for electricity services in some areas to be taken over by local governments.Dennis Herrera, the city attorney for San Francisco, where PG&E has its headquarters, mentioned the possibility of a publicly owned utility to ensure affordable and reliable power. He said his office would \u201cremain vigilant\u201d that the company would not \u201cshift its failures onto the back of hardworking residents.\u201d\u2018Hell on Earth\u2019: The First 12 Hours of California\u2019s Deadliest WildfireThe Camp Fire, which has killed dozens, quickly devastated the town of Paradise within hours of starting.PG&E\u2019s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday said the company planned to ask a court for bankruptcy protection \u201con or about Jan. 29,\u201d saying the move was \u201cultimately the only viable option to restore PG&E\u2019s financial stability to fund ongoing operations and provide safe service to customers.\u201dThe filing noted that the company was required to give employees 15 days\u2019 notice of such a move, under a recently passed California law.Tom Dalzell, business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245, and the utility said workers would not be affected by the bankruptcy. In fact, Mr. Dalzell said the union supported the bankruptcy effort as a way to ensure that the workers were treated fairly at a time when, he believed, undue criticism was being aimed at PG&E for its fire prevention efforts.\u201cThere are minor electrical failures that happen at every utility that cannot be engineered out,\u201d Mr. Dalzell said. \u201cThere are 1.1 million trees trimmed a year that our members do.\u201dBut a judge in the United States District Court for Northern California criticized PG&E for its safety violations and issued an order Wednesday for the utility to \u201creinspect all of its electrical grid and remove or trim all trees that could fall onto its power lines.\u201d A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 30.PG&E has filed for bankruptcy once before, after a botched deregulation move by the state in 2000 and 2001 resulted in blackouts and soaring electricity rates.Garry South, a longtime Democratic political consultant who worked for Mr. Newsom when he was mayor of San Francisco, was the chief political adviser to Gov. Gray Davis during the earlier energy crisis.\u201cThis will be the first crisis that Gavin Newsom faces as governor,\u201d Mr. South said. \u201cHow a governor acquits himself when a crisis likes this hits really has an effect on how people view him as a leader.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: A Rival Makes a Bid for Gannett", "category": "Business", "id": "bd06a4ce-7a0b-4860-9266-f6abd044c010", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/business/dealbook/dealbook-briefing-digital-first-gannett-sale.html", "publishdate": 20190114, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/15/business/15db-newspapers/merlin_113683564_4a1700ce-ecce-4e40-8a03-50f1a571fe36-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Monday morning.

MNG, which has a history of acquiring struggling local papers and cutting costs, has a 7.5 percent stake in Gannett, making it Gannett\u2019s largest active shareholder. Gannett\u2019s stock price surged in premarket trading after the bid.The back story: Over the past few years, MNG has made several approaches about a deal, only to be rebuffed, the WSJ reported. Gannett, whose shares have dropped in recent years, has been seeking to remake itself. In 2016, it backed off a bid to acquire Tronc, the media company now known as Tribune Publishing.The backlash: MNG, one of the largest newspaper chains in the country, owns about 200 newspapers and publications including The Denver Post and The Orange County Register. Last year, frustrated journalists at The Denver paper criticized its owner, making the case for its survival.In related news: The East Bay Express, an alternative weekly in San Francisco, laid off almost its entire editorial staff on Friday, its publisher said, adding that it would rely instead on freelance writers.

The NYT\u2019s Peter Baker writes:\u201cInstead of talks to end the shutdown, the president spent at least part of his weekend defending himself against the suspicions about his affinity for Mr. Putin.\u201dIn recent days, The Washington Post found that President Trump had repeatedly tried to hide details of his conversations with Mr. Putin. The NYT reported on the F.B.I.\u2019s counterintelligence investigation of Mr. Trump, which was initiated after he fired James Comey as F.B.I. director and questioned whether he had been influenced by Russia.Asked in an interview on Fox News on Saturday night if he was a Russian agent, President Trump said it was \u201cthe most insulting thing I\u2019ve ever been asked.\u201d He did not issue an explicit denial.The new Democratic House majority has seized on the revelations, adding another pressure point in President Trump\u2019s strained relationship with Congress. Negotiations to end the shutdown, at a standstill over President Trump\u2019s demand for border wall funding, could end up on the back burner, even as contagion effects seep through the economy.\u2022 As a result of the shutdown, 800,000 federal workers are either furloughed or working without pay, and many are filing for unemployment benefits.

The new year has only intensified nervousness over slowing global growth while providing a steady drumbeat of unimpressive holiday sales, and slashed revenue and profit forecasts.Risk aversion in the market has cramped liquidity, leading to increased warnings about volatility fueled by automated trading programs. And the effect of the 2017 tax overhaul is waning, putting companies in the difficult position of comparing their current lackluster results with their strong performance after the law first went into effect.ImageCar dealerships in Beijing.CreditThomas Peter/ReutersChinese exports and foreign investment tumbleThe cavalcade of data demonstrating China\u2019s slowing economic growth continues, with the largest drop in exports in two years.Analysts had expected the Chinese government to report a gain in outbound shipments for December. Instead, the dollar value of exports slumped 4.4 percent from a year earlier, as Chinese electronics and other products struggled to excite international consumers.Imports fell 7.6 percent; domestic demand for goods is weakening, with car sales contracting for the first time in more than two decades last year, and sliding 13 percent last month in the sixth straight month of declines.The figures underscored a recent refrain on Wall Street: China\u2019s powerhouse economic engine is sputtering.\u2022 China\u2019s overall trade surplus is at its lowest level since 2013. However, even amid a bitter trade feud with the Trump administration, China\u2019s surplus with the United States is the largest it has been in more than a decade, with exports from China growing 11.3 percent last year, compared with a 0.7 percent increase in imports from the U.S.\u2022 But China\u2019s foreign direct investment in North America and Europe has slumped to a six-year low. American regulators are intensifying their oversight of deals with Chinese companies, and Chinese officials have tightened the flow of funds overseas. Chinese investment in the U.S. fell 83 percent last year, while its investments in Canada surged 80 percent.\u2022 Foreign companies continue to complain about barriers in China.

But I also see it as a way to embolden government.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThere are powerful disincentives working against government innovation, because innovation involves risk, and risk involves the potential for failure. And if there\u2019s one thing that scares politicians \u2014 not to mention their political advisers \u2014 it\u2019s failure.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe second disincentive working against innovation in government is more understandable: fiduciary duty. As an elected official, you are responsible for spending taxpayers\u2019 dollars wisely, and it can be hard to justify spending the public\u2019s money on an untested idea, especially when budgets are already stretched thin.

Those free bags are \u201cfree\u201d only after you pay the credit card\u2019s annual fee, which generally starts at around $95.\u201cThe way people talk about it is that it\u2019s a way to avoid these fees, but the fees are only there because of the airline,\u201d said Taylor Tepper, a senior writer at Wirecutter who recently analyzed various airlines\u2019 credit cards. \u201cSo the airline then wins, no matter what you do.\u201dThis month, Wirecutter, a consumer advice website owned by The New York Times, released a guide to travel credit cards. Its recommendation? The airline-branded cards typically aren\u2019t the best choice.Mr. Tepper said that for many travelers, general-use credit cards like the American Express Platinum or Chase Sapphire Reserve were much better options. While their annual fees are high \u2014 $550 for the American Express card and $450 for the Chase card \u2014 they provide hefty credits that can be used with any airline to cover expenses like checked bags and in-flight purchases, along with other benefits like access to airport lounges.Travelers must ultimately consider which benefits matter most to them. An airline-specific credit card could be the right choice if priority boarding and a free checked bag are primary concerns. But Mr. Tepper cautioned not to expect much else, even from a top-tier airline card.\u201cWhen it comes to getting elite status, you\u2019re not really going to get that with a credit card,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are on an American flight three times a week and you\u2019re going all over the place, you\u2019re probably getting that elite status all by yourself.\u201dAnd elite frequent fliers will usually get access to airline lounges and free checked bags whether or not they have the airline\u2019s credit card. It is possible to get elite status with some airline cards if you spend enough money, but the threshold is high \u2014 $25,000 a year on Delta and United Airlines, for example. Otherwise, airlines require a minimum amount of flying each year to achieve frequent-flier status.Most travelers will have to pay for a top-tier credit card if they want to maximize their benefits. Like the American Express and Chase Sapphire cards, the airlines\u2019 top cards usually cost at least $450 annually, and even the most expensive cards are rarely enough to bolster frequent-flier standing by themselves. So don\u2019t expect free upgrades to first class. Without frequent-flier status, you\u2019ll still have to use miles or pay cash for that bigger, more comfortable seat.Prospects are even dimmer with airline credit cards that have lower annual fees. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get elite status with these middle-tier cards,\u201d Mr. Tepper said.Many travelers think it makes sense to use one airline\u2019s credit card if they fly mostly with that airline. \u201cDelta flights, Delta credit cards, life is simple,\u201d Mr. Tepper said. But, he said, \u201cthose people would benefit more, on the whole, with the American Express Platinum Card.\u201dHe added, though, that airline-branded cards still had perks.\u201cYou will benefit if you have a Delta card that gets you free checked bags,\u201d Mr. Tepper said. \u201cIf you travel twice, it will more than pay for your annual fee, so the loss is an opportunity cost.\u201dWirecutter found that the cards from some carriers, particularly Southwest Airlines, JetBlue and Alaska Airlines, offered better benefits to loyal fliers than other airline cards. New Southwest cardholders who enroll before Feb. 11 and spend $4,000 in the first three months will earn a companion pass, which allows them to choose one person to fly with them on any of their flights free for the rest of the year. But the pass will not be renewed next year, and there\u2019s a high point threshold to earn it again.When comparing airline cards, travelers need to remember that the value of an earned mile isn\u2019t constant, either between carriers or over time, said Jay Sorensen, the president of IdeaWorksCompany, a consulting firm that focuses on the airline industry.His company estimated, for example, that an award mile was worth 1.4 cents on Southwest Airlines in 2018 and 0.7 cents on American. That meant a traveler would have to spend 7,579 points for an average round-trip economy ticket on Southwest and 25,000 for a similar ticket on American.Mr. Sorensen said he never spent miles on domestic economy tickets.

The punishment came after Mr. King, who has a long history of racist remarks, made comments to The Times last week questioning why white supremacy was considered offensive.\u2022 Several times last year, President Trump said privately that he wanted to withdraw from NATO, senior officials told The Times. A former under secretary of defense said an American pullout from NATO would be \u201cthe wildest success that Vladimir Putin could dream of.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Trump rejected a proposal from the Republican senator Lindsey Graham to temporarily reopen the government in an effort to jump-start talks with Democrats on funding a border wall.\u2022 In the heart of Trump country, some furloughed federal workers are still backing the president\u2019s demand for a wall, keeping Republican senators in line as the shutdown stretches on.\u2022 Private donors put up $107 million for Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration two years ago. It is now clear how the money was used.\u2022 Trade policies and tariffs designed to help the farm and steel industries have done anything but. Farmers now have to deal with higher costs and loss of access to some markets, while steel prices in the United States have fallen back to pre-tariff levels.\u2022 Trying to calm Democrats\u2019 fears, William P. Barr, Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, promised he would let the special counsel finish his investigation. But Mr. Barr is still under pressure to renounce his hostility toward whistle-blowers.\u2022 Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s eldest daughter, will assist Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, in choosing the next president of the World Bank.\u2022 Senator Bernie Sanders, hoping to contain the damage from reports of sexism and harassment in his 2016 campaign, plans to meet with former staff members who want assurances that things will change if he runs again.\u2022 A key question for the Democrats\u2019 potential presidential field is which candidate will be the best antidote to Trumpism.

That\u2019s going to hurt some consumers.Many of its users pay for the service even if they don\u2019t consistently watch its content, partly because of its attractive pricing. A bare-bones subscription, for instance, had cost $8 a month. But fee increases at Netflix are inevitable. One of reasons: Netflix burns a lot of cash.The company\u2019s appetite for content means it has to spend big, resulting in what\u2019s known as negative free cash flow. More money is going out the door than coming in, a difference that Netflix covers by borrowing even more.\u201cWe change pricing from time to time as we continue investing in great entertainment and improving the overall Netflix experience,\u201d the company said in a statement announcing the changes, which apply just to United States customers.Netflix\u2019s most popular plan, which gives a customer two simultaneous streams, will get the largest increase, to $13 a month from $11. Still, it\u2019s cheaper than HBO, whose streaming service costs about $15 a month. The $8 a month plan will now cost $9, and the high-end version, which allows for four simultaneous streams, jumps to $16 from $14. (The new prices took effect Tuesday for new subscribers. For existing customers, the increases will start in about three months.)Netflix, which will report quarterly earnings on Thursday, has committed to spending over $18.6 billion on content. That\u2019s for shows and films that won\u2019t appear on the service for months, whether it\u2019s the next season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d or the forthcoming lineup from the super producer Shonda Rhimes.It also includes content that\u2019s currently playing, like \u201cFriends,\u201d which ran on NBC from 1994 through 2004 and is owned by AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia. The show is wildly popular on the service. Worries that it would leave Netflix prompted an outcry on social media. \u201cThe only reason I have an account with Netflix is to rewatch \u2018Friends,\u2019\u201d one customer said.That helps to explain why Netflix agreed to pay AT&T approximately $100 million to keep the show through this year, a threefold increase from what it had been paying on average.Original shows owned by Netflix are also expensive. \u201cStranger Things,\u201d whose new season will become available this summer, costs as much as $8 million per episode. Netflix has to pay for all of that up front.Multiply that by the hundreds of hours of original content that Netflix produces every year, and the cash starts to bleed out. The company had negative free cash flow of $2 billion last year. It expects that figure to rise to about $3 billion this year and about the same next year. That has added to the company\u2019s debt: up to $12 billion before it proposed borrowing another $2 billion in October through a bond offering.Spending big on content while keeping prices modest has helped Netflix expand its customer base, about 58 million in the United States and 130 million worldwide. Those figures will be updated Thursday as part of its earnings report.But Netflix technically isn\u2019t losing any money. In fact, it claims a profit every quarter since accounting rules allow entertainment companies to record most of their production or licensing costs later on.The stakes for owning content have risen. Big-pocketed players like the Walt Disney Company, AT&T and NBCUniversal plan to compete with Netflix with streaming services of their own. Both Disney and AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia plan to unveil their products by the end of the year, and NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast, is working on an ad-supported model streaming service that it plans to make available in early 2020.Not to be left out, Amazon offers a streaming service as part of its Prime shipping program for $13 a month, or $120 a year. Hulu sells an ad-free service for $12 per month. (Disney will take control of Hulu once it completes its acquisition of the bulk of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox business, sometime around the middle of the year.)There is also Apple, which has spent well over $1 billion to create original TV shows. The boom in streaming has increased costs throughout Hollywood, where competition for talent and property has intensified.As Netflix\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, said in October: \u201cThere\u2019s never been so much TV and movies being created around the world. So the game is on.\u201d"}, {"title": "Ford and VW Team Up, With Talk of Driverless and Electric Cars", "category": "Business", "id": "18d7a069-e6dd-412e-bed3-0d0463c9d507", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/business/ford-volkswagen.html", "publishdate": 20190115, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/16/business/16FORD1/merlin_147499341_49a3f856-6250-4d4d-8c26-84c285a72323-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Ford Motor and Volkswagen have outlined what the companies hope will become a broad alliance \u2014 one that will hasten development of electric and self-driving cars and eventually cut costs.But the initial step announced Tuesday, a plan to cooperate on pickup trucks and delivery vans, will do little to address the troubles both automakers face now. It also falls short of the detailed restructuring plan from Ford that investors have been waiting to see for more than a year.On the fringes of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Ford said it would develop and manufacture a compact pickup truck that the two companies may sell under their own names in South America, Africa and Europe. The truck will be based on the new Ford Ranger, which goes on sale in the next few weeks. Ford will also produce a large delivery van and Volkswagen a compact van, both primarily for Europe.Ford expects those projects to save about $500 million a year, but not until after the vehicles are introduced in 2023.\u201cWe are forecasting the benefits at the end of our five-year period, so it is the 2023-2024 time frame mostly that the synergies start to accrue,\u201d Ford\u2019s chief executive, Jim Hackett, said in a conference call.The companies said they were continuing to discuss ways to cooperate in the development of electric vehicles and self-driving technology, but stopped short of detailing how they might do that.\u201cIt just makes sense to share investment, pool innovation capabilities and create scale effects in clearly defined areas,\u201d said Volkswagen\u2019s chief executive, Herbert Diess. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we are going to do together with Ford.\u201dRebecca Lindland, an independent auto consultant, said that many big auto alliances failed, but that those that prospered tended to start out small and expand slowly.\u201cVW and Ford have a nice synergy with their customer base, so this limited partnership could be successful,\u201d she said.Ford has invested more than $1 billion in a bid to produce a driverless vehicle that can transport passengers or deliver goods. It is also spending $11 billion to develop more than three dozen electric or hybrid models that it plans to roll out over the next five years.Volkswagen, too, is developing a string of electric cars. On Monday, the company said it would spend $800 million to build a plant next to its existing factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. It will assemble a battery-powered sport utility vehicle that the company has called the ID Crozz.Volkswagen\u2019s push into electric vehicles began after its diesel scandal, in which it rigged diesel cars with software to cheat on emissions tests. To settle lawsuits in the United States, it agreed to buy back diesel cars from owners and paid a fine of $4.3 billion. It also promised to introduce a range of electric vehicles in the United States, and has funded a company that is installing charging stations in cities around the country.But both companies have more immediate issues: a suddenly slumping auto market in China, slow growth and slim margins in Europe, and the need to develop technologies to meet the stringent emissions regulations that Europe will phase in.Ford\u2019s issues go beyond those challenges. Unlike General Motors, whose stock jumped last week when it raised its financial guidance, Ford is expected to show a decline from a year earlier when it releases its fourth-quarter earnings next week. While the company remains solidly profitable in North America, it is losing or barely making money in the rest of the world.Mr. Hackett, who was named chief executive almost two years ago to revitalize Ford, has announced plans to cut jobs, but has not yet outlined a comprehensive turnaround strategy \u2014 something many analysts expected within months of his taking the top job.\u201cFord continues to frustrate investors by delivering piecemeal information on its future plans,\u201d said Philippe Houchois, an analyst at Jefferies Securities. \u201cWe continue to see tremendous scope for improving Ford\u2019s performance through its own restructuring and more extensive cooperation with VW.\u201dFord\u2019s stock has been trading at levels last seen during the recession a decade ago.

He called Mr. Trump a \u201cgreat president,\u201d and said that his tax cuts had helped American business.Ms. Meng was arrested in Canada last month on accusations of defrauding banks to help Huawei\u2019s business in Iran. Washington is seeking her extradition, but Mr. Trump has suggested that he might intercede if it would help China and the United States reach a deal to end their trade war. Huawei has said that it is unaware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng.And last week, the Polish authorities said they had arrested a Huawei employee there on charges of spying for Beijing. The company fired the man on Saturday.Mr. Ren insisted that his company had not spied for China.\u201cI love my country. I support the Communist Party. But I will never do anything to harm any country in the world,\u201d Mr. Ren said on Tuesday. A company spokesman confirmed his remarks.Huawei has 180,000 employees and has become the world\u2019s largest maker of telecommunications equipment. It estimates that it generated more than $100 billion in sales last year, and it sells more smartphones around the world than Apple. Yet Mr. Ren seldom appears in public.ImageMeng Wanzhou, a daughter of Ren Zhengfei who is Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, was arrested in Canada last year at the request of the United States.CreditAlexander Bibik/ReutersWhen he has spoken to the news media in the past, he has played down his achievements, attributing Huawei\u2019s success to its employees\u2019 hard work. He has said that his company has never spied for any government \u2014 an assertion that has not eased the concerns of American counterintelligence officials.For most of its existence, Huawei was opaque to people in China, too.It was founded in 1987, but it did not begin publishing the names and biographies of its board members until its 2010 annual report. Mr. Ren spoke to the news media for the first time in 2013. The next year, he told The Independent of London that he had no hobbies, prompting a colleague to lean in and suggest that he enjoyed reading and drinking tea.Mr. Ren was born in 1944, in the mountainous southwestern province of Guizhou. His parents were teachers; he was one of seven children. His father, Ren Moxun, was the son of a master ham maker in Zhejiang Province. When he was growing up, Mr. Ren wrote in a 2001 article, the family was so poor that he did not own a proper shirt until after high school.According to an official company biography, he studied engineering in college and joined the Chinese military\u2019s infrastructure engineering corps in 1974 to help build and run a factory manufacturing synthetic fibers for textiles. At a time when China had no private-sector economy to speak of, it was not unusual for college graduates to join the military.The infrastructure engineering corps was disbanded in 1983, according to the official biography. A few years later, Mr. Ren and business partners founded Huawei in what he called, in a 2016 interview with the official news agency Xinhua, a \u201crun-down shack.\u201d The company started as a reseller of telephone equipment imported from Hong Kong, but later started developing its own technology.As it expanded around China and then across the world, Huawei inculcated a die-hard competitive spirit in its employees, pushing them to work harder and move faster than the company\u2019s rivals. Huawei still speaks proudly of its \u201cwolf culture.\u201d\u201cWe will always have wolf culture,\u201d Mr. Ren said in an interview last year with Xinhua. \u201cCatching prey might be difficult. But the wolf is unrelenting.\u201dMr. Ren has a reputation for being blunt in conversation. In 2010, Rick Perry, then the governor of Texas, spoke at the ribbon-cutting for Huawei\u2019s new American headquarters in Plano.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t know any better, you\u2019d say he grew up out in West Texas,\u201d Mr. Perry, who is now Mr. Trump\u2019s energy secretary, said, according to a video of the event posted online by the governor\u2019s office.ImageHuawei has 180,000 employees and sells more smartphones around the world than Apple.CreditGilles Sabri\u00e9 for The New York TimesThat penchant for brutal honesty has not spared the members of Mr. Ren\u2019s family who also have worked for Huawei: Ms. Meng and her husband, plus two of Mr. Ren\u2019s siblings.For a long time, people in the telecom industry speculated about whether Mr. Ren would pick one of these relatives to lead the company after his death. But in a 2013 letter to employees that was shared on a company website, Mr. Ren said his successor needed to have vision, good character and a deep understanding of both new technologies and customers\u2019 needs.\u201cMy family members do not possess these qualities,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTherefore they will never join the line of succession.\u201dMr. Ren\u2019s plain speaking has not managed to make United States officials feel comfortable about allowing Huawei\u2019s gear into the country\u2019s internet infrastructure.Huawei executives have said repeatedly that they are independent of the Chinese government and military. They have challenged Western governments to produce evidence that the firm\u2019s products are vulnerable to state meddling.According to a diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks, Mr. Ren told the American consul general in Guangzhou in 2008 that if Huawei really had ties to Beijing, the company would be in real estate, not telecom equipment. That, he said, was where the easy money was.But for some of Huawei\u2019s critics, such assurances do not outweigh larger concerns about the Chinese government\u2019s behavior in the digital realm.\u201cIt\u2019s not really about Ren\u2019s roots in the P.L.A., in my opinion,\u201d said Andrew Davenport, the chief operating officer of RWR Advisory Group, a Washington-based risk consulting firm, referring to the People\u2019s Liberation Army. \u201cIt\u2019s just the fact that they\u2019re Chinese, and are tainted by their government\u2019s poor record on cyberespionage.\u201dMr. Davenport added: \u201cAny global Chinese tech actor is at risk of being considered a liability, because they\u2019re going to be susceptible to doing what Chinese government wants them to do.\u201d"}, {"title": "Gillette Ad With a #MeToo Edge Attracts Support and Outrage", "category": "Business", "id": "df25a149-4967-4e3b-be80-1602de1d42a5", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/business/gillette-ad-men.html", "publishdate": 20190115, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/16/business/16gilette2/16gilette2-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "In less than two minutes, the men and boys in Gillette\u2019s new ad engage in a panoply of bad behavior: bullying, fighting, discrimination, sexual harassment and more.

Within a day, it was the subject of a battle in which support for its message collided with calls for boycotts.The ad, developed by Gillette\u2019s advertising agency, Grey, was defended and praised by the actress Rosanna Arquette, the comedian Pete Dominick, the screenwriter and director Jeffrey Reddick, Arianna Huffington and others.But on social media, one man called it \u201ca condescending ad from a company that relies on men buying their products.\u201d Another wrote that \u201cbeing a man is not a disease nor a pathology,\u201d adding that \u201cit is grotesque to repeatedly ascribe collective guilt onto half of humanity known as men.\u201dThe television personality Piers Morgan railed on Twitter about the ad, calling it \u201cpathetic,\u201d \u201cvirtue-signalling\u201d and \u201ca direct consequence of radical feminists\u201d who are \u201cdriving a war against masculinity.\u201d He said he had used Gillette razors for his entire adult life but, like the actor James Woods, was considering jumping ship.On YouTube, the ad has been liked more than 1,700 times. But it received more than 10,000 thumbs down votes.Gillette said it had commissioned a study of 1,188 adults and found that the results \u201cemphasize the outsized importance of \u2018soft\u2019 skills in today\u2019s modern man.\u201dSoon after Gillette\u2019s ad appeared online, its rival Dollar Shave Club posted a message on Twitter that seemed to welcome new customers. The post was liked more than 4,500 times, compared with a few dozen likes on the company\u2019s other posts.This is not the first time Procter & Gamble, which owns Gillette, has echoed progressive themes in its marketing.The company\u2019s Pantene hair products line once ran a \u201cStrong Is Beautiful\u201d campaign, which featured football players from the New Orleans Saints, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Dallas Cowboys braiding their daughters\u2019 hair. The #LikeAGirl campaign for the Always feminine hygiene products, which encourages girls to face the fear of failure, shows them playing chess, fencing and drumming.But in taking a position on the idea of toxic masculinity, Gillette and Procter & Gamble could be dealing with a \u201chot potato,\u201d said Dean Crutchfield, the chief executive of the brand advisory firm Crutchfield & Partners.\u201cIf this is just a quick campaign to get some attention, not something they\u2019re weaving into the fabric of their company going forward, it\u2019s going to blow up in their face,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a huge topic and it\u2019s highly sensitive, and I don\u2019t think P. & G. had done anything as explosive as this could be.\u201dOther companies have also inserted themselves into discussions about sexuality, race, culture and other contentious issues.Years ago, Old Spice wanted to convince men that shower gel was masculine while appealing to the women who were actually buying the product. The resulting \u201cSmell like a man, man\u201d campaign is now considered a marketing triumph.Pepsi\u2019s 2017 ad featuring Kendall Jenner was also memorable, but mainly because of the intense criticism it faced borrowing imagery from the Black Lives Matter movement, watering it down and then using it to sell soda. The company pulled the ad and apologized.Ram trucks met a similar reception last year when they used a sermon by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in a Super Bowl ad.Gillette is a giant in the shaving industry, but its foothold is shrinking as scrappy competitors offering disposable razor subscriptions capture younger consumers. Dollar Shave Club was acquired by Unilever for $1 billion in 2016. Harry\u2019s, another razor purveyor, raised $112 million from investors last year to expand beyond men\u2019s grooming.Sales for Gillette\u2019s grooming segment slipped 1 percent in its most recent quarter. The brand, which has mistakenly mailed free razors intended for 18-year-old men to middle-aged women, has tried to stay fresh by experimenting with personalized 3-D-printed razor handles and designing blades for sensitive skin."}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: \u2018Forecasting a Slowdown\u2019 for 2019", "category": "Business", "id": "a3e2b3ef-8acd-44fd-974e-8812a44751b4", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/business/dealbook/pge-banktruptcy-california-wildfires.html", "publishdate": 20190115, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/16/business/16db-china/merlin_149198817_a42723ed-68e2-44f4-8759-c1e6be4f3ae7-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Tuesday morning.

The bankruptcy announcement, made in a regulatory filing, pushed the company\u2019s shares down more than 50 percent and posed a challenge for state regulators, who will have to decide whether to raise electricity rates.The utility\u2019s woes could be just part of a wider economic toll from climate change, which is fueling wildfires nationwide.The quick take: Lights will stay on, but power bills are likely to increase. Wildfire victims may have to accept smaller settlements. And California may find it harder to reach ambitious climate change goals.Market fallout: Investors have long considered utilities a safe bet, so this is a reminder that volatility can strike any industry. Shareholders could be wiped out and bondholders could take a hit.A complex bet: The P.G.&E. stock held by the Baupost Group, the hedge fund run by Seth Klarman, is part of a bigger wager on the utility. Baupost also bought $1 billion of legal claims that an insurer held against it.ImageSteel pipes in Baytown, Tex.CreditDavid J.

Hiring remains stagnant, and investors are wary about the industry\u2019s long-term strength, the NYT\u2019s Alan Rappeport writes:Stock prices for some of the nation\u2019s biggest steel manufacturers dropped by as much as 47 percent in 2018 amid fears of slowing global economic growth and the potential for Mr. Trump to reach trade deals that remove the tariffs.The industry\u2019s best hope would be major infrastructure legislation, which looks increasingly unlikely.More: President Trump said yesterday that tariffs had put pressure on China\u2019s weakening economy, but trade talks between the two nations have yielded little.Day 25: It\u2019s still shut downPresident Trump spent a snowy weekend cooped up in the White House, serving fast food to the Clemson Tigers and not giving in to proposals to end the government shutdown.

Terry Branstad and Senators Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst. Each of those Iowa Republicans overlooked Mr. King\u2019s history of racist remarks and divisive conduct \u2014 well before his recent comments about \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d \u2014 and backed Mr. King\u2019s re-election in the state\u2019s most heavily conservative district.Mr. King won handily.\u201cThey didn\u2019t care too much about Steve King \u2014 it was about the primary voters Steve King represents,\u201d said the former state senator Rick Bertrand, the G.O.P. challenger in that race.VideoBuilding a border wall, ending birthright citizenship and disparaging undocumented immigrants. Representative Steve King championed anti-immigration views years before President Trump made them a focal point of his administration.CreditCreditSteve Pope/Associated PressHe described the support for Mr. King as an act of \u201cself-preservation\u201d by Republican politicians who did not want to cross the hard-line voters in Western Iowa\u2019s conservative heartland. \u201cBut now the reality is we may actually lose the seat, so Steve has finally fired Steve,\u201d Mr. Bertrand said.One day after House G.O.P. leaders stripped Mr. King of his committee assignments, Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking Republican, pushed him toward the exits, Iowa Republicans began a \u201csuper PAC\u201d aimed at unseating him in 2020 and Ms. Ernst said voters in Iowa would make \u201cthe correct choice moving forward\u201d about Mr. King, it was becoming clear that the nine-term lawmaker may finally be facing the ultimate political consequence for his remarks.\u201cIt\u2019s racist, we do not support it or agree with it, and I think he should find another line of work,\u201d Ms. Cheney told reporters Tuesday, going even further than the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, about Mr. King\u2019s comment to The Times: \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201dThe House also voted nearly unanimously on Tuesday to endorse a resolution that rejected white nationalism and white supremacy as \u201chateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States.\u201d Even though it was aimed at the Iowa Republican, the broadly worded resolution was less than some lawmakers wanted to bring up, and even Mr. King spoke in favor of it.Representative Bobby Rush, an Illinois Democrat, wanted to formally censure Mr. King and drafted a measure to do just that.\u201cMy resolution lets Steve King know if he continues this type of behavior, then the next level would be expulsion for him,\u201d said Mr. Rush, who was the only no vote.The confluence of his closer-than-expected re-election, the devastating losses House Republicans suffered with educated and minority voters in November and the blunt-force nature of what he does not deny saying has made Mr. King toxic in his party\u2019s caucus.Yet even as it became clear that his fate may be sealed, many Democrats and, more quietly, some Republicans were wondering why he survived as long as he has given his 15-year record of making what were at a minimum racially provocative comments.His drift toward nativism may have seemed of little consequence when he was a junior lawmaker in George W. Bush-era Washington and Republicans were more sympathetic to immigration.But no other member of Congress has so aggressively sought to develop relationships with white nationalist groups abroad, and those groups became empowered at about the same time the then-candidate Donald J. Trump was making a hard line on immigration his signature issue.As a result, Mr. King\u2019s inflammatory remarks have gained more attention \u2014 both because of how they reflect on him and how they cast a brighter light on Mr. Trump and the Republican Party.Some congressional Republicans saw the path Mr. King was on: Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the House campaign arm last year, surprised some in the party by speaking out against Mr. King shortly before the election. Mr. Stivers called Mr. King\u2019s conduct \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d and said \u201cwe must stand up against white supremacy and hate in all forms.\u201dStill, for the most part, G.O.P. officials looked the other way or offered one-off condemnations of Mr. King as his flirtation with nationalist figures like Geert Wilders of the Netherlands deepened and he made increasingly incendiary remarks about, for example, the impossibility of sustaining \u201ccivilization with somebody else\u2019s babies.\u201dThe tolerance of Mr. King\u2019s conduct \u2014 and he did seem emboldened by Mr. Trump\u2019s takeover of the party \u2014 stands in contrast to how an earlier generation of Republicans addressed public displays of racial bigotry or racial insensitivity. Bigots like the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke were shunned by party officials, and when the former Senate majority leader Trent Lott used Strom Thurmond\u2019s 100th birthday party to seemingly praise segregation, it cost him his leadership post.So why would Republicans wait until Mr. King flatly defended white supremacy to punish him?\u201cI haven\u2019t been following every utterance of Congressman King. I certainly followed this one, and I think the House Republican conference did the right thing,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, told reporters Tuesday.Asked the same question, Mr. McCarthy shot back: \u201cHave I been leader for years?\u201dHe said he had been the top House Republican for only \u201ca short amount of time\u201d and was now \u201cin a position to take action.\u201dImageRepresentative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the Democratic House majority whip, brought the resolution condemning white supremacy.CreditAl Drago for The New York TimesBut one former adviser to the last Republican leader, the former Speaker Paul D. Ryan, pointedly noted on Tuesday that Mr. McCarthy and Steve Scalise, his second-in-command, were not as vocal as Mr. Ryan when it came to Mr. King\u2019s eruptions.Of course, Mr. Ryan never sought to punish Mr. King as severely as Mr. McCarthy did Monday.Former aides to Mr. Ryan and John A. Boehner, another former House speaker, said both admonished Mr. King, but noted that he was a backbencher of little consequence in the Capitol and argued that he had not said anything nearly as incendiary as what he did last week.\u201cAlong with public pushback, Paul admonished King directly several times about his behavior,\u201d said AshLee Strong, who was a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan. \u201cThese latest comments warrant harsh consequences, and he believes McCarthy did the right thing by booting him.\u201dDavid Schnittger, a former aide to Mr. Boehner, recalled that his ex-boss called Mr. King\u2019s comments about young migrants smuggling marijuana \u201cdeeply offensive and wrong\u201d and pointed out that the then-speaker had privately used an obscenity to describe Mr. King in the aftermath of those remarks.Another former aide to Mr. Boehner, Michael Steel, said Mr. King\u2019s behavior had reached \u201ca tipping point\u201d but conceded that congressional Republicans also face a political imperative.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to win back the majority by winning suburban districts in places like California and New Jersey, it\u2019s important to take a firm line against this sort of thing,\u201d Mr. Steel said.But he said publicly what many Republicans say privately: that excommunicating Mr. King will matter little if Mr. Trump is the nominee in 2020.\u201cWhatever we do on Steve King is on the margins compared to what the president says and does,\u201d Mr. Steel said.In Iowa, Mr. King\u2019s longtime supporters said they felt that he was unfairly treated by the media and that the warm and engaging lawmaker they saw in the largely rural district was nothing like the caricature they read about.But after defeating a little-known Democrat by only just over three percentage points and increasingly shifting his attention from the soybean rows and hog processing plants around Sioux City to the fringe nationalist politics in other countries, Mr. King\u2019s defenders started to lose their patience.\u201cWho cares who the mayor of Toronto is when you\u2019re from northwest Iowa?\u201d said Mark Lundberg, the former chairman of the Sioux County Republican Party, alluding to Mr. King\u2019s endorsement last fall of Faith Goldy, a white-nationalist candidate in Canada\u2019s largest city. \u201cIt was just a constant.\u201dWhile calling Mr. King \u201ca good guy,\u201d Mr. Lundberg said that he crossed a line with his comments on white supremacy and that it was time for the district to rally behind a candidate \u201cwithout all the controversy.\u201dEchoing Mr. Bertrand, Mr. Lundberg acknowledged that there was \u201cgreat concern\u201d in the party about how close Mr. King\u2019s re-election was \u2014 leaving little doubt that what is partly driving the calculation to nudge him out is that he may imperil the party\u2019s hold on what is otherwise a safe Republican seat.Republicans there have created a super PAC called Iowa Four, named after the district, to target Mr. King, according to an Iowa Republican involved with the planning. And the conservative Club for Growth PAC has made inquiries in the state about finding a potential alternative to the incumbent.Mr. King already has two Republican opponents, and Mr. Bertrand did not rule out another bid.\u201cThe day of reckoning has come, and now it is just a matter of how the story ends,\u201d crowed Nick Ryan, an Iowa Republican strategist who has long sought to oust Mr. King.For the first time since 1899, Mr. Ryan noted, Iowa does not have a member on the House Agriculture Committee.And two of Iowa\u2019s largest newspapers, The Des Moines Register and The Sioux City Journal, each published an editorial Tuesday urging Mr. King to resign.But he has given no indication that he will resign. He said on the House floor Tuesday that he \u201cunderstands and recognizes the gravity of this issue\u201d and insisted that he rejects white supremacy.But his critics in Iowa were already testing out their attacks, suggesting voters would not return a lawmaker to office who is too controversial to even serve on any committees.\u201cHe has been rendered impotent,\u201d Mr. Bertrand said. \u201cThe national folks are forcing the local hand.\u201d"}, {"title": "Steve King Removed From Committee Assignments Over White Supremacy Remark", "category": "Politics", "id": "1d17d540-28dc-4076-9e99-6d3b2673acd3", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/steve-king-white-supremacy.html", "publishdate": 20190115, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/15/us/politics/15kingrepubs-print-promo/15kingrepubs-print-promo-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "content": "House Republican leaders removed Representative Steve King of Iowa from the Judiciary and Agriculture Committees on Monday night as party officials scrambled to appear tough on racism and contain damage from comments Mr. King made to The New York Times questioning why white supremacy is considered offensive.The punishment came on a day when Mr. King was denounced by an array of Republican leaders, though not President Trump. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, suggested Mr. King find \u201canother line of work\u201d and Senator Mitt Romney said he should quit. And the House Republicans, in an attempt to be proactive, stripped him of the committee seats in the face of multiple Democratic resolutions to censure Mr. King that are being introduced this week.Those measures would force Republicans to take a stand on the House Democratic majority\u2019s attempt to publicly reprimand one of their own.Mr. King, who has been an ally of President Trump on the border wall and other issues, has a long history of making racist remarks and insults about immigrants, but has not drawn rebukes from Republican leaders until recently. In November, top Iowa Republicans like Senator Charles E. Grassley endorsed Mr. King for re-election even after one House Republican official came out and denounced him as a white supremacist.[Steve King has a history of making racist remarks. Read them and more here.]But in an interview with The Times published last week, Mr. King said: \u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201dSpeaking to reporters on Monday night after the House Republican leadership team acted, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, said he was not ruling out supporting a censure or reprimand resolution against Mr. King. He said the Republicans are not removing Mr. King from the G.O.P. House conference itself, so he can still attend its party meetings, and it was up to Iowans whether Mr. King should stay in office.\u201cThis is not the first time we\u2019ve heard these comments,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said of Mr. King, an acknowledgment of the racist language the congressman has used before. \u201cThat is not the party of Lincoln and it\u2019s definitely not American.\u201dMr. McCarthy, who conferred privately with Mr. King for an hour before the vote, did not say why the most recent comments were a breaking point given Mr. King\u2019s long public record of similar remarks. \u201cMaybe I did not see those, but I disagree with these.\u201dThe full Republican conference must still technically ratify the leader\u2019s decision, but Mr. McCarthy presented the matter as closed.Mr. King remained defiant after losing his committee seats, releasing a long statement insisting that his comments in the Times article had been misunderstood. He said he had been referring only to \u201cwestern civilization\u201d when he asked \u201chow did that language become offensive,\u201d not \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d or \u201cwhite supremacist.\u201d\u201cLeader McCarthy\u2019s decision to remove me from committees is a political decision that ignores the truth,\u201d he said.He said he told Mr. McCarthy, \u201cYou have to do what you have to do and I will do what I have to do.\u201d He pledged to continue to \u201cpoint out the truth\u201d and serve his district for \u201cat least the next two years.\u201dThe push to condemn Mr. King illustrated how alarmed senior Republicans are about the party\u2019s image just two months after they lost 40 House seats, most of them in suburban or diverse districts \u2014 including seven in Mr. McCarthy\u2019s home state of California, where the G.O.P. is on the brink of extinction.The condemnations of Mr. King stood in stark contrast to the lawmakers\u2019 willingness to tolerate President Trump\u2019s  frequent offensive and insensitive remarks about migrants, black people, Native Americans and other minorities.Just last week, the president used the Oval Office to unleash a blistering assault on undocumented immigrants, portraying them as criminals in a fashion that harked back to an earlier era of American politics but rarely heard from a president in modern times. And on Sunday night, Mr. Trump invoked the Wounded Knee massacre of hundreds of Native Americans as an attempt to joke about Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\u201cI\u2019m glad that they are finally taking action after all of these years of Steve King slandering immigrants and Hispanics, but the president of the United States is also doing that and he just said something about Elizabeth Warren a few evenings ago that was also racially ugly and we haven\u2019t heard a word of condemnation from anyone in the Republican Party about that,\u201d said Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Congressional Republicans have continued to embrace the president and his hard-line immigration politics, averting their gaze from his inflammatory rhetoric out of fear their core voters will punish them if they stray from Mr. Trump.The president, when asked by reporters on Monday about Mr. King\u2019s remarks, said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been following it.\u201dVideoBuilding a border wall, ending birthright citizenship and disparaging undocumented immigrants. Representative Steve King championed anti-immigration views years before President Trump made them a focal point of his administration.CreditCreditSteve Pope/Associated PressRepublicans are now trying to get ahead of a fast-moving political problem while the country is in the midst of a lengthy government shutdown over a border wall by President Trump, who in many ways patterned his immigration policies and rhetoric on those of Mr. King.Mr. McCarthy called a special meeting of the Republican Steering Committee to remove Mr. King from Judiciary \u2014 which has jurisdiction over immigration, voting rights and impeachment \u2014 and Agriculture, which is a prized committee for Iowans. Mr. King also lost his seat on the Small Business Committee. The steering committee vote was unanimous.While Republican officials quickly turned on Mr. King, the party also came in for criticism from the Senate\u2019s lone black Republican, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina. He noted that the G.O.P. has long remained silent in the face of racist comments.\u201cSome in our party wonder why Republicans are constantly accused of racism \u2014 it is because of our silence when things like this are said,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote in a Washington Post opinion column.It is not clear what, if any, additional steps congressional Republican leaders will take with Mr. King. The National Republican Congressional Committee indicated Monday that they were not ready to step away from him.\u201cThe N.R.C.C. does not get involved in primaries and isn\u2019t going to comment on a hypothetical general election two years away,\u201d said Chris Pack, a spokesman for the House campaign arm.Democrats are moving to censure or reprimand the Iowa congressman, a stinging penalty. Among them were Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest ranking African-American in Congress, who introduced a measure Monday night in the form of a resolution of disapproval of Mr. King\u2019s comments and white nationalism.Democratic leaders in the House have yet to say what they will do with the competing censure resolutions, but are inclined to allow a vote of some sort related to Mr. King\u2019s remarks, according to one senior Democratic aide.In the interview with The Times, Mr. King also reflected on the record number of minorities and women in the new Democratic-controlled House. \u201cYou could look over there and think the Democratic Party is no country for white men,\u201d he said.Mr. King\u2019s hard-line immigration policies and demeaning comments about Hispanics foreshadowed Mr. Trump\u2019s nativist rhetoric in his 2016 campaign, in his two years in the White House and during the government shutdown over a border wall. The president once boasted to Mr. King that he raised more money for him than anyone else, Mr. King recalled in the Times article, which traced how the Iowa congressman helped write the playbook for white identity politics that dominate the Republican Party under Mr. Trump.He has already drawn one serious primary opponent, state senator Randy Feenstra, for the 2020 campaign and some high-profile Republicans have indicated they will not embrace his re-election.\u201cIt does open the door for other individuals to take a look,\u201d Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa said in a television interview last week of Mr. King\u2019s closer-than-expected victory last year.Ms. Reynolds said she was staying out of the primary \u201cright now,\u201d but multiple Iowa Republicans said the state\u2019s senior elected officials were unlikely to endorse Mr. King again and would wait until there is more clarity in the primary field before rallying to one of his G.O.P. challengers. Other Western Iowa Republicans are expected to challenge Mr. King, who has fended off primaries before but did so with the support of his party and its top leaders.In addition to Ms. Reynolds\u2019s criticism, Iowa Republican chair Jeff Kaufmann said the state party would \u201cremain neutral\u201d in Mr. King\u2019s primary.Also, Iowa\u2019s two Republican senators, Mr. Grassley and Joni Ernst, along with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who had appointed Mr. King a co-chairman of his 2016 presidential campaign, all rebuked Mr. King in recent days.All had eagerly embraced him in the past because of his standing with the state\u2019s most conservative voters \u2014 keys to winning statewide elections in Iowa, which holds the first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest.Mr. Grassley had endorsed Mr. King in November for re-election, even after the chairman of the House Republican election committee denounced Mr. King as a white supremacist.\u201cIowa needs Steve King in Congress,\u201d Mr. Grassley said in that endorsement. \u201cI also need Steve King in Congress.\u201dMs. Ernst, who faces re-election in 2020, appeared with Mr. King at a rally in his district the Monday before Election Day last year, after he had endorsed a Toronto mayoral candidate with neo-Nazi ties."}, {"title": "In Portland, Scooter Start-Ups Played Nice.

Electric scooters, owned by start-ups looking to mimic the success of ride-hailing companies like Uber, appeared around town. The idea was simple: Use a smartphone app to rent a scooter and then leave it at the end of the ride for the next person.Soon, people in cities from San Francisco to Paris were complaining that the scooters were all over sidewalks \u2014 usually without the approval of local officials.In Portland, Ore., city officials worried that they would soon get their own flock of uninvited scooters. So they established a four-month pilot program in July with a limit on scooters and a requirement that companies share detailed data about trips and injuries with city officials.That data, released Tuesday by the city\u2019s Bureau of Transportation, offers the most detailed analysis of the impact of e-scooters on a city. Scooters often replaced short car trips in Portland, offering some support for one of the biggest selling points the companies have made to communities: They can help reduce congestion and pollution. And the scooters did not lead to as many injuries as some had feared.But it is not yet clear if scooter companies can comply with different cities\u2019 tight and varying limits and still run profitable local operations. The programs often cap the number of scooters and dictate which neighborhoods they ought to be in.\u201cThat is not letting the market determine how many scooters should be anywhere,\u201d said Gabriel Scheer, Lime\u2019s director of strategic development. \u201cHow do you unfetter us in a way that allows us to meet demand?\u201dStill, Portland officials are using the pilot program to make a big point with start-ups: It is better to ask permission and work with local regulators than risk being run out of a community.That has not always been the case among start-ups trying to get a piece of the so-called sharing economy. Ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft and the short-term rental company Airbnb have usually jumped into new markets before local regulators have had time to understand their businesses.For the scooter start-ups, not asking for permission has had consequences. After Lime and Bird began to operate without permission in San Francisco, the city instituted a permit system \u2014 but issued permits to only Skip and another smaller competitor, Scoot, effectively locking Lime and Bird out of the city. Some cities have simply impounded the scooters.\u201cA lot of these companies roll into town, flout local regulations, see what they can get away with and how far they can push cities to accommodate them,\u201d said Chloe Eudaly, a Portland city commissioner. \u201cI feel like there is somewhat of a reversal of that trend among these companies and they are learning that\u2019s not necessarily the best way to do business.\u201dOther cities are establishing permit programs to limit the impact of unexpected scooter invasions. Washington, for example, said in November that companies could deploy no more than 600 scooters each, which Bird argued would make it \u201cimpossible\u201d to provide full service.Bird, Lime and Skip received permits to operate in Portland. They handed over a wealth of data about scooter rides, giving city regulators access to information about where each trip started, the route it followed, where it ended and what time of day it occurred. Personal information on riders, such as payment data, was not shared.Portland capped the number of scooters at about 2,000, roughly divided among the three companies. Mr. Scheer, from Lime, said the cap system made it difficult to determine how many scooters a city actually needed.But he added that the limits forced scooter companies to hone their operations, offer scooters with smoother rides and ensure they were deployed in neighborhoods where they could draw the most riders. And the caps forced the start-ups to compete on how well they could comply with the city\u2019s mandates rather than playing a numbers game.\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a land-grab type of business. This is one where you have to solve problems in a sustainable way,\u201d said Sanjay Dastoor, the chief executive of Skip. \u201cHaving more vehicles on the road isn\u2019t going to help if there aren\u2019t places where people can ride them and feel safe.\u201dThe data that Portland collected allowed the city to assess whether e-scooters live up to their promises of reducing pollution and congestion. According to a citywide survey, 34 percent of residents who used the scooters and took a survey said they had used e-scooters to replace driving their own car or taking an Uber.City officials also had concerns about accessibility and safety, but saw low rates of injury and will continue to study those issues during a second test run.Some rules were meant to get the scooters into neighborhoods that could be underserved. One hundred scooters from each company had to be positioned in East Portland, a lower-income neighborhood with poor access to Portland\u2019s public transit system. About 6 percent of the city\u2019s rides originated in that neighborhood.Scooter start-ups didn\u2019t always comply with restrictions, according to the report. The scooters often exceeded the speed limit of 15 miles an hour that the city had imposed, and none of the start-ups completely fulfilled their obligations to deploy scooters in East Portland.Over the four-month program, Portlanders took 700,369 scooter rides. Nineteen percent of those rides occurred between 3 and 6 p.m. on weekdays. But it was a small sample size compared with other cities. In Paris, which has no scooter cap, Lime alone provided more than a million rides over four months.When the Portland pilot effort ended in November, all of the e-scooters were cleared off the streets. The city is planning a second, yearlong pilot program in the spring but has not decided how many scooters it will allow, a spokesman said.\u201cIt seemed like a little bit of carnival on our streets for a while, but I think they definitely have potential to make our city easier to navigate for a lot of different people in different ways,\u201d Ms. Eudaly said.She even took a ride on an e-scooter. \u201cIt was fun. It was easy,\u201d she said."}, {"title": "YouTube Bans Risky Prank Videos Amid Spate of \u2018Bird Box\u2019 Challenge Stunts", "category": "Business", "id": "4fdfa0b0-8a3e-4a9e-bb11-cd4a06993fbd", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/business/youtube-bans-pranks.html", "publishdate": 20190116, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/world/17youtube/17youtube-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LONDON \u2014 Scenes of pranks ranging from silly to hazardous have long been among YouTube\u2019s most popular offerings. Now, after multiple reports of people putting themselves or others at risk by copying some of those stunts, the video-sharing service is clamping down on content that, in its view, depicts \u201cdangerous challenges and pranks.\u201dOn Tuesday, YouTube, a unit of Google, updated its policies \u201cto make it clear\u201d that challenges \u201cthat can cause death and/or have caused death in some instances,\u201d pranks \u201cwith a perceived danger of serious physical injury\u201d and anything that causes \u201cchildren severe emotional distress\u201d are not allowed on the site.In a statement, YouTube said the update \u2014 which cited pranks involving home invasions or drive-by shootings as unacceptable \u2014 was a result of a routine review of its longstanding enforcement guidelines and an effort to better define what it allows users to post. Users whose videos are taken down over the next two months for violating the standards can appeal the removals.\u201cWe heard feedback from creators that we could provide some clarity on certain community guidelines,\u201d the statement said, \u201cso we published materials detailing our policies against pranks that cause others to seriously fear for their safety or that cause serious emotional distress to children and vulnerable individuals.\u201dThe revised guidelines specifically cite so-called Tide pod challenge videos as the kind that is banned, but they do not mention a more recent YouTube phenomenon that presumably falls in the same category: videos of people taking the so-called \u201cBird Box\u201d challenge.Inspired by the Netflix film of the same name, the challenge calls for people to perform everyday tasks \u2014 including, in at least one high-profile case, driving \u2014 while blindfolded. A spate of videos posted on YouTube in recent weeks that show people taking the challenge has prompted warnings from the authorities and Netflix itself.\u201cCan\u2019t believe I have to say this, but: PLEASE DO NOT HURT YOURSELVES WITH THIS BIRD BOX CHALLENGE,\u201d Netflix pleaded in a message on Twitter.\u201cBird Box\u201d challenge videos have shown children running into walls and YouTube celebrities spending 24 hours blindfolded. They have veered into more dangerous territory in Britain, where the transport police are investigating footage of a man walking blindfolded onto railroad tracks.The police noted that it was illegal to walk onto a live railway and warned against doing so, saying, \u201cThey are quite literally playing a game of life and death.\u201dWhen the Tide pod challenge went viral last year, Procter & Gamble, the detergent\u2019s maker, urged parents to keep their children from taking part. \u201cThe possible life-altering consequences of this act, seeking internet fame, can derail young people\u2019s hopes and dreams and ultimately their health,\u201d David Taylor, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement at the time.Another of the challenges cited in YouTube\u2019s revised guidelines, the so-called fire challenge, has resulted in children who attempted it being hospitalized.Other popular pranks and challenges have been innocuous, humorous and even virtuous. The talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel has gotten laughs by challenging parents to give their children unimpressive presents and then record their reactions. Other examples have involved people dancing to Drake or flipping a bottle of water. The \u201cIce Bucket Challenge\u201d raised awareness of, and money to fight, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.YouTube said it would continue to welcome such videos."}, {"title": "Veterans of the News Business Are Now Fighting Fakes", "category": "Business", "id": "a2504853-a7ba-4681-98b9-d6bcb7872a52", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/business/media/media-steve-brill-fake-news.html", "publishdate": 20190116, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/business/17brill/merlin_149232318_ce332b2a-a068-4800-b962-1fcf828a9c48-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "On the internet, conspiracy theories, propaganda and plain old inaccuracies can stump even the most thoughtful readers, spreading faster than you can say \u201cfake news.\u201dA small start-up, NewsGuard, says it may have a solution. The effort is led by a pair of veteran news executives \u2014 Steven Brill, an author and the founder of the magazine The American Lawyer, and Gordon Crovitz, a former publisher of The Wall Street Journal. On Wednesday the company announced that it had signed Microsoft as its first major client.NewsGuard has created the equivalent of nutrition labels for news organizations, rating more than 2,000 news and information sites with tags: red for unreliable, green for trustworthy. A team of roughly 50 journalists and analysts is making the evaluations.NewsGuard has given its stamp of approval to established publications like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, as well as later entrants like BuzzFeed and Newsmax. FoxNews.com, The Hill, The Daily Beast and HuffPost have also gotten green lights.Sites to watch out for, according to NewsGuard, include Infowars and Breitbart on the right, and Daily Kos on the left. Media Matters, a left-leaning advocacy organization with a prolific media-watchdog blog, has received a green rating, but scores negatively on four of the nine criteria used by NewsGuard.The start-up hopes to become a regular part of the reading experience on the web. Its premise is that it is more efficient to rate news organizations than the endless stream of articles rolled out each hour.The service, free to readers, offers a browser extension that shows a news operation\u2019s rating when a reader lands on its site. The NewsGuard tag also appears in search results next to article links for those who have the extension.ImageIn the NewsGuard rating system, a green icon indicates a trustworthy news website.\n CreditNewsGuard\u201cThe point is to make this ubiquitous,\u201d Mr. Brill said in an interview.To make money, the company has pitched major technology companies to license its software and incorporate its ratings into their services. The first major tech player to sign on is Microsoft, which has agreed to install the system onto its mobile browser, NewsGuard said.The venture is not Mr. Brill\u2019s first go-round on the media beat. In 1998, he founded the monthly magazine Brill\u2019s Content, which chronicled how the journalism sausage got made until it closed in 2001.He acknowledged that, for now, NewsGuard\u2019s analysis lacked the distribution to have a major effect, but a Gallup survey funded by the Knight Foundation suggested that independent ratings can change how people consume news. Readers who participated in the poll were less likely to share headlines that were flagged as potentially misleading. (The Knight Foundation is also an investor in NewsGuard.)NewsGuard has raised about $6 million at a valuation of around $20 million. Its biggest corporate backer is Publicis, an advertising holding company.Both founders said they were surprised, at first, by the advertising industry\u2019s interest in their project. \u201cFor them, it\u2019s the whole problem of fake news being an issue for \u2018brand safety,\u2019\u201d Mr. Brill said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even heard that term until we looked out for investors.\u201dLast year, some advertisers fled YouTube after they noticed their messages were appearing alongside videos promoting terrorists. And while they haven\u2019t abandoned Facebook, marketers are requesting more data to make sure their brands aren\u2019t being associated with questionable content.Facebook has become a flash point for the spread of false reports. To combat media pollution, the company has worked with fact checkers and has enlisted third-party groups, including The Associated Press, Snopes and PolitiFact, to make evaluations. Still, it can take up to three days for Facebook to verify content \u2014 which has little or no effect, in most cases, since articles go viral in minutes.Facebook and other social networks have not signed on with NewsGuard, but Mr. Brill and Mr. Crovitz anticipate that some kind of ratings service will eventually be adopted across the web. And despite their positioning as a nutrition label for news, they said no one should interpret their work as an endorsement for some kind of media equivalent to the Food and Drug Administration.\u201cWe\u2019d be very uncomfortable if the government were mandating anything with regard to news,\u201d Mr. Crovitz said. \u201cThat would violate free speech values.

Earlier rulings from the European Union\u2019s Intellectual Property Office in favor of McDonald\u2019s had forced Supermac\u2019s, a string of restaurants mainly in rural Ireland, to shelve its plans to expand in Europe.But last week, the office accepted the Irish chain\u2019s argument that McDonald\u2019s had not properly registered its Big Mac trademark. It was an unlikely victory for a company with annual revenue of about $93 million over one taking in $22.8 billion.Pat McDonagh, the founder and owner of Supermac\u2019s, said McDonald\u2019s had become a global \u201ctrademark bully.\u201d\u201cThe name Supermac comes from when I used to play Gaelic football \u2014 that was my nickname as a boy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe felt we should be allowed to use any part of my own name we liked so long as it doesn\u2019t infringe on anyone else\u2019s name.\u201dMcDonald\u2019s, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment, can appeal the decision.The dispute dates to 2014 when McDonald\u2019s \u2014 famously defensive of its brands and trademarks \u2014 opposed Supermac\u2019s application for a European Union trademark for its name.McDonald\u2019s cited its company name and many \u201cMc\u201d-branded products \u2014 McFlurry, McNuggets, McMuffin. But the case came down to the similarity between Supermac\u2019s and Big Mac, the only McDonald\u2019s brand using Mac instead of Mc. (Mac is a common Irish and Scots surname prefix, meaning \u201cson of,\u201d and is often shortened to Mc.)At the time, the Intellectual Property Office ruled that the fact that both Macs came after a similar qualifier \u2014 Super and Big \u2014 could \u201cresult in a likelihood of confusion.\u201dIn response, Supermac\u2019s argued that McDonald\u2019s had never correctly registered its right to the Big Mac trademark in the first place.Image\u201cThe name Supermac comes from when I used to play Gaelic football \u2014 that was my nickname as a boy,\u201d said Pat McDonagh, the founder of Supermac\u2019s, which aims to expand in Europe.CreditPaulo Nunes dos Santos for The New York TimesThe Big Mac is probably as well known in Europe as it is in its native United States. It has been 25 years since Quentin Tarantino\u2019s cult movie \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d featured a discussion about hamburger nomenclature in France, where \u2014 thanks to the metric system \u2014 a Quarter Pounder is called a Royale With Cheese but \u201ca Big Mac\u2019s a Big Mac.\u201dSupermac\u2019s lawyers contested the process by which the brand had been legally trademarked, and the Intellectual Property Office ultimately agreed. It found that the documentation provided by McDonald\u2019s was not sufficient to show that Big Mac had been \u201cput to genuine use in the union for the goods or services for which it is registered\u201d during the requisite previous five years.\u201cIf you have a registered trademark, you have to use it or lose it,\u201d said Glen Gibbons, an Irish barrister and expert on intellectual property who was not involved in the case. \u201cYour trademark can be challenged on grounds of lack of use. It is then incumbent on the trademark owner to show that they were really using the trademark and selling it in a substantive part of the E.U.\u201dThe proof furnished by McDonald\u2019s included internally generated company material and a printout of a Wikipedia entry on the history of the Big Mac.\u201cAs far as the printout from en.wikipedia.org is concerned, it is noted that Wikipedia entries cannot be considered as a reliable source of information, as they can be amended by Wikipedia\u2019s users,\u201d the judgment noted.Having won his case, Mr. McDonagh plans to register the Supermac\u2019s trademark Europewide and resume planning for an expansion into British cities with large Irish populations.The case has been greeted with pleasure in Ireland, where Supermac\u2019s has become something of a national institution. Founded in 1978 in small-town Ballinasloe, County Galway, Supermac\u2019s has 102 outlets in the Republic of Ireland and four in Northern Ireland. (McDonald\u2019s has about 37,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries.)Mr. Gibbons, the trademark lawyer, said he thought McDonald\u2019s was likely to appeal what appeared to be quite a technical decision. The two chains might also decide to negotiate a settlement.And a further complication might come into play: If Britain leaves the European Union without a trade deal in March, the trademark litigation will abruptly cease to have any jurisdiction there.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen \u2014 maybe it won\u2019t happen at all,\u201d Mr. McDonagh said of a no-deal \u201cBrexit.\u201d \u201cIt does make common sense, as far as I can see, to leave things as they are.\u201d"}, {"title": "Sears Won\u2019t Close Yet as Its Chairman, Edward Lampert, Fends Off Creditors", "category": "Business", "id": "df09af99-c073-49c0-b953-187e50d87160", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/business/sears-lampert-takeover-bid.html", "publishdate": 20190116, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/09/business/16sears1/merlin_147224913_5ba88406-3e08-4fb4-8a02-01b278b09bdd-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Sears lives.

The final details of the sale still needed to be arranged, and negotiations continued through the day.Mr. Lampert, a hedge fund manager, was the only bidder at a closed-door auction this week who sought to keep the company operating. All of the competing bidders planned to liquidate the company\u2019s real estate, inventory and brands.A federal bankruptcy judge must still approve Mr. Lampert\u2019s bid, giving the company\u2019s creditors a chance to derail the deal. Last week, the bankruptcy judge, Robert D. Drain, said Mr. Lampert\u2019s bid was \u201ca good development\u201d because it offered Sears a shot at survival.If the deal is approved, Sears will emerge from bankruptcy with less debt, but it will still face steep odds in winning back shoppers. Mr. Lampert is deepening his investment in Sears at a time of great uncertainty for old-line retailers. While overall consumer spending has been solid, some retailers like Macy\u2019s and J. C. Penney reported weak holiday sales, signaling that their turnaround plans are floundering as Americans change the way they shop.[Read more about what led Sears to file for bankruptcy.]Founded shortly after the Civil War, Sears was once the nation\u2019s largest retailer. But it has been in a precipitous decline for years, losing ground to Amazon and Walmart as consumers moved their spending online and mall-based chains suffered.It is unclear how Mr. Lampert plans to turn Sears around. The company filed for bankruptcy in October, as its sales stalled and its debt payments mounted.Mr. Lampert, who took control of Sears in 2005 when it merged with Kmart, was the company\u2019s largest shareholder and lender through his hedge fund, ESL Investments.Some creditors have criticized Mr. Lampert for making deals, including selling some of the company\u2019s most valuable real estate and the Lands\u2019 End brand, that have benefited his hedge fund while harming Sears in the long run.Mr. Lampert has countered those arguments by saying in interviews that his investments in Sears have hurt him financially.Even without Mr. Lampert\u2019s financial engineering, analysts acknowledge that Sears would still probably struggle to compete against more innovative retailers with greater resources."}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: \u2018Brexit\u2019 Deal Fails; What\u2019s Next for Britain?", "category": "Business", "id": "96b6925e-63c3-49a0-945b-0d75d89bfb99", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/business/dealbook/brexit-defeat-britain-may.html", "publishdate": 20190116, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/business/17db-brexit/merlin_149253468_ae6f6527-45e7-41ef-b60f-40eff8543d06-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Wednesday morning.

Kraft Heinz announced that it would distribute free food to federal workers.But as the stalemate enters its 26th day, economists are warning that the damage is real and growing, writes Jim Tankersley. The Council of Economic Advisers said that each week of the shutdown reduces quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percentage points as furloughed employees and contractors sit idle, steadily scaling back their spending.Business and consumer confidence \u2014 already burdened by signs of slowing global growth, trade tensions with China and the waning effects of the 2017 tax overhaul \u2014 could suffer. With no end to the standoff in sight, the economy could slip from what appears to be the strongest year of growth since the financial crisis into a stall, or worse. According to Michael L.

The promotion of the drug helped set off the opioid epidemic.The Sacklers are one of the richest families in the U.S., with much of their wealth derived from OxyContin sales. In a statement, Purdue Pharma, rejected suggestions of wrongdoing by the company or members of the Sackler family.Apollo nears $10 billion deal for ArconicApollo Global Management is close to a deal to buy Arconic, an aerospace-parts maker, for more than $10 billion, the WSJ reports.The news: Apollo would pay $21 to $22 per share for Arconic, which has a market value of about $9.3 billion. The price would represent a premium of 5 percent to 10 percent above the closing price of Arconic\u2019s shares on Tuesday. The deal is likely to be announced this week.The back story: Several buyout firms have shown interest since last summer in acquiring Arconic, which was formed from the break up of Alcoa in 2016.The context: A deal would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts in recent years and another sign of a thaw in debt markets. Last week, Targa Resources became the first issuer to sell junk bonds since November, ending a 40-day stretch without a high-yield bond sale.A proposed media deal lands another in a tangleA takeover bid for Gannett could complicate its pursuit of Gizmodo Media, which owns Deadspin and Jezebel as well as its namesake technology website.The news: Gannett is a serious bidder for Gizmodo Media in an auction that has also drawn attention from the owner of Gawker.com, the WSJ reported, citing anonymous sources. Univision put Gizmodo Media up for sale in July.Why it\u2019s complicated: In an open letter to the Gannett board, MNG Enterprises, a major Gannett shareholder, offered on Monday to pay $12 cash per Gannett share. MNG which is owned by the hedge fund Alden Global Capital, accused Gannett of damaging the company\u2019s financial position by making several \u201caspirational digital deals\u201d that haven\u2019t paid off. It demanded that Gannett postpone all digital acquisitions and hire bankers to review strategic alternatives.Bank earnings show weakness in the economyFourth-quarter results released on Tuesday by JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo pointed to concerns about the credit and housing markets.\u2022 Revenue at both banks missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates, and both announced underwhelming loan growth. At JPMorgan, commercial and industrial loans increased 1 percent, down from 4 percent in the prior quarter. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, said the bank will pull back lending even more if necessary, saying, \u201cWe are not going to be stupid.\u201d Wells Fargo said its mortgage originations fell 28 percent year over year.\u2022 JPMorgan said its revenue from fixed income trading declined 16 percent from a year earlier, mirroring a similar slump reported on Monday by Citigroup. But net interest income, the gap between earnings from loans and payouts to depositors, rose 10 percent for JPMorgan and 3 percent for Wells Fargo.\u2022 Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are to release their own reports today.\u2022 In the airline industry, United Continental beat expectations as fourth-quarter revenue soared 11 percent. The airline said its earnings for this year could be as high as $12 per diluted share.

Aisha Harris, assistant TV editor for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.What\u2019s your setup for watching the TV shows or movies you review? What could be better about it?Much of my TV and movie consumption for work involves screeners, which are sent out to the press ahead of release. For TV, these screeners are almost always in digital form, via the network\u2019s press site or a link sent by email, so I usually watch those on my laptop. On the rare occasion I\u2019m not feeling too lazy \u2014 or if it\u2019s a show, like \u201cHomecoming,\u201d that really rewards viewing on a bigger screen \u2014 I\u2019ll hook up my laptop to my TV. If I\u2019m unable to attend a press screening in person for a movie I\u2019m reviewing, I\u2019ll review the DVD at home on my TV.My fianc\u00e9 and I recently upgraded our home entertainment setup, with a 50-inch 4K Amazon Fire TV. We also own a Sonos soundbar and a two-room Sonos Play:1 wireless speaker set that sounds incredible. The only downside is that the wireless speakers have been cutting in and out for some time when paired with our TV. Troubleshooting on our own thus far hasn\u2019t yielded great results, and the tech support hours coincide with when we\u2019re at work. It\u2019s a fairly common problem, according to the multiple message boards I\u2019ve stumbled upon, so I\u2019m hoping someone can help us find a quick, easy solution soon.How has your setup for watching TV and movies changed over time?When I moved to New York in my early 20s for graduate school, my roommates and I had a common area with a TV, but I rarely used it. I was the millennial who saw no need for cable anymore once I could stream almost everything I wanted, and I was content viewing primarily on my laptop. With rare exception, I never had time for or cared enough to watch shows while they aired live, so finding it online later was my go-to.ImageA screener for \u201cBlack Monday,\u201d a new narrative series from Showtime.CreditMelissa Bunni Elian for The New York TimesImageMs. Harris doesn\u2019t have cable, but subscribes to most of the top streaming services.CreditMelissa Bunni Elian for The New York TimesI still don\u2019t have cable, but I do have pretty much every major streaming service there is \u2014 Netflix, Hulu Live (which is basically cable), HBO, Showtime, Amazon and, once upon a time, FilmStruck (R.I.P.).Streaming services like Netflix and Hulu give you tons of options for programs to watch. The downside is that it feels impossible to decide what to watch. How do you pick a program to watch?\u00a0The short answer: I keep a running list of movies and shows I want to eventually see on my Notes app (it\u2019s very long and never-ending), and when I\u2019m able to watch something that isn\u2019t directly work related, I consult the app and choose whatever fits my mood.The long answer is that often none of the titles on said list fit my mood in the moment. This conundrum is almost as maddening to me as having a case of severe writer\u2019s block. To put it bluntly: There have been times when, after flipping through the various services and perusing the latest \u201cnew to streaming\u201d articles online, I suddenly look at the clock and realize that 90 minutes have passed. I\u2019ve watched nothing! I could have had a brand-new movie viewing experience in that time. Or binged approximately four episodes of \u201c30 Rock.\u201dActually \u2014 almost as embarrassing as wasting so much time merely trying to decide what to watch is the fact that I usually wind up just rewatching something I\u2019ve already seen a million times, like \u201c30 Rock\u201d or \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201dRelated: How do you determine which shows or movies are worth writing about? The \u201cworthiness\u201d of a show or a movie when it comes to coverage can be baked in: the names involved, the subject matter (Is it adapted from a wildly popular book series? Are our writers and critics excited about it?), the network or platform it\u2019s appearing on. Social media plays a part, too, however \u2014 if something not initially on my radar is getting a lot of buzz on Twitter, I\u2019ll at minimum check it out and see what it\u2019s all about.In the past, cord-cutting was an impractical option because people missed out on live sports or broadcast news. What\u2019s the situation today?I have zero interest in live sports or broadcast news \u2014 I get most of my news from online and via my daily RSS feed. (I\u2019ve been using Feedly for years.) But it seems absolutely possible to not have cable and still be a sports fan and news junkie, especially because of Hulu Live or digital media players like Amazon Fire and Roku. Of course, you just wind up substituting one cord for a bunch of separate cords in this case \u2014 I\u2019m probably paying nearly the same amount I would be if I had a cable bundle.Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?A recent addition to my home is the Eufy RoboVac 30C. We have hardwood floors and a dog that sheds, which has made keeping the floor relatively clean a nearly impossible task. But this has done a good job reducing the amount of dust I find on the bottom of my socks.I\u2019m fairly certain it\u2019s listening in on our conversations, and my dog scampers to the other side of the room or jumps on our bed when it passes near her, but I love it."}, {"title": "On Politics: Republicans Put the Squeeze on Steve King", "category": "Politics", "id": "dfcc3eae-2773-487d-8749-d00a7976b338", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/us/politics/on-politics-republicans-steve-king.html", "publishdate": 20190116, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Wednesday morning.

He added, \u201cI have always said that if Carlos Ghosn were to be durably incapacitated, we\u2019d have to move on to something else, and we\u2019re there now.\u201dBeing ousted by a company that had resisted doing so would be the latest turn in a swift, stunning fall from grace for Mr. Ghosn, a larger-than-life car industry figure who forged a global business empire that bound Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors together in what was known as the Alliance.The public push for Mr. Ghosn\u2019s removal from Renault came after senior French officials flew to Tokyo after the Tuesday bail hearing. Martin Vial, one of two French government representatives on the Renault board, and Emmanuel Moulin, Mr. Le Maire\u2019s chief of staff, are expected to meet Japanese officials and Nissan stakeholders during the trip, which was planned a few days ago, according to a Finance Ministry spokeswoman.The carmakers must move quickly to try to put the blowup behind them.Demand for cars in China, the United States and Europe, the three biggest markets, is falling. Analysts say the partnership that Renault and Nissan founded in 1999 to share purchasing and expertise is essential if the companies are to stay competitive in an industry where size provides a crucial advantage.In a nod to the importance of scale, Ford Motor and Volkswagen outlined on Monday what they hope will become their own broad alliance to speed the development of electric and self-driving cars, potentially creating competition for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance on that front.Nissan and Mitsubishi removed Mr. Ghosn from their boards immediately after his initial arrest on Nov. 19, but Renault and the French government have maintained that he had a \u201cpresumption of innocence.\u201d Privately, though, succession plans were being prepared in case of a prolonged detention. Because Mr. Ghosn still faces a long trial in Japan, he cannot carry out his executive functions.Appointing a successor to Mr. Ghosn would not necessarily mean Renault considered him guilty of wrongdoing, but could instead reflect his inability to perform his duties from jail, where, his family says, the spartan conditions have also harmed his health.On Monday, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s wife, Carole, published a letter to Human Rights Watch, a global advocacy group, calling her husband\u2019s detention \u201ca case study in the realities of a draconian system.\u201d She said that Mr. Ghosn had lost almost seven pounds in two weeks of mostly eating rice and barley, and that he had been denied medication and allowed to bathe only two or three times a week.Renault\u2019s lawyers are still reviewing evidence that Nissan has presented in the case against Mr. Ghosn, in which Japanese prosecutors have accused him of understating his income for years and improperly transferring personal losses to Nissan\u2019s books in 2008. He has denied all charges.A top aide to Mr. Ghosn, Greg Kelly, was arrested on a related charge and released on bail on Christmas Day after more than a month in jail. Mr. Kelly has also denied the charges against him.The case has taken on a political dimension in France, where President Emmanuel Macron is facing scrutiny as a result of the so-called Yellow Vest protests against income inequality and the declining purchasing power of the country\u2019s working-class residents. The alliance has employees around the world, and Renault, with over 47,000 workers, is one of France\u2019s biggest employers.Mr. Le Maire said the decision to push for the carmaker to replace Mr. Ghosn was linked to the need to preserve jobs and stability at the alliance. \u201cJobs are the priority,\u201d he said in the television interview.After Mr. Ghosn\u2019s initial arrest, Renault appointed its chief operating officer, Thierry Bollor\u00e9, to assume day-to-day responsibilities as chief executive, and its lead independent director, Philippe Lagayette, as temporary chairman.It is possible that Mr. Bollor\u00e9 would now be appointed chief executive on a permanent basis. As for the chairman\u2019s position, Mr. Le Maire urged in the television interview that Jean-Dominique Senard, the chief executive of the tire maker Michelin, be considered.It is a challenging moment for Renault and Nissan. Renault\u2019s new car sales in Europe have declined lately, diminishing the company\u2019s share of its core market. In the United States, Nissan is facing the consequences of a strategy championed by Mr. Ghosn that focused on winning market share through discounts at the expense of profits. Nissan is trying to cut back on the discounts just as the overall market enters a downturn.Renault still relies on financial contributions from Nissan, the alliance\u2019s dominant performer, and some Renault officials are concerned that Nissan\u2019s sales and financial performance have been slipping.The companies\u2019 relationship has been strained by suspicions in France that Nissan may be using the vacuum left by Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest to reshape the alliance\u2019s balance of power. Renault owns a 43 percent stake in Nissan, while Nissan holds a 15 percent share in Renault that does not carry voting rights.Nissan has been seeking a rebalancing of the alliance since the French government abruptly doubled its voting rights in 2015. In an effort to ease tension, Renault, which controls three seats on the Nissan board, agreed not to meddle in Nissan\u2019s governance.But the arrests of Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly left two Nissan board seats vacant. And last month, Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, declined a Renault request that an urgent meeting be held to appoint immediate replacements.Instead, Nissan formed a committee that is to issue a report on the matter in March. That fanned suspicions in Paris that Nissan was maneuvering to prevent Renault from participating in alliance decision-making at a critical time.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s children have claimed separately that his arrest was the result of a revolt by his Nissan colleagues.In a rare interview published in the French business daily Les Echos on Monday, Mr. Saikawa dismissed talk that Nissan had organized a plot to oust Mr. Ghosn as \u201cabsurd,\u201d and contrary to the \u201cserious\u201d evidence he said the company had gathered.Nissan\u2019s internal investigation, he said, \u201csuggests that we are dealing with deliberate manipulation and concealment.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Saikawa did not press the point about rebalancing the alliance, while playing down questions about how Nissan could have overlooked the alleged improprieties by Mr. Ghosn that stretched back years.Mr. Saikawa said in the interview with Les Echos that he was certain that if Renault directors, who have not yet seen the documents handed over by Nissan, had access to the full file, they would \u201cdraw the same conclusions we did.\u201d"}, {"title": "The Easy (and Free) Way to Make a Budget Spreadsheet", "category": "Business", "id": "f82fb203-bd1a-433c-8860-fd3870fa0995", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/technology/personaltech/the-easy-and-free-way-to-make-a-budget-spreadsheet.html", "publishdate": 20190116, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/technology/personaltech/17TECHTIP_01/17TECHTIP_01-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "It\u2019s January and you\u2019ve gone and done it: You\u2019ve resolved to keep better track of your personal finances. But deep down, you\u2019re not sure where to start. Sure, you can buy accounting software, sign up for a service or poke around your bank\u2019s online offerings for money management. But don\u2019t overlook what is probably the best option of all: a simple and free spreadsheet you make yourself.Never used spreadsheet software before and not quite sure what it does? Relax, using it to make a budget is easy, because someone has already done most of the work. Here\u2019s how to get started.Step 1: Pick Your ProgramFirst, select an application that can create and edit spreadsheet files. Microsoft Excel has long been a core component of the Microsoft Office suite for Mac and Windows ($70 a year). If you don\u2019t have it already, you can also find versions for Android and iOS or the free basic version that runs in a web browser.Other free or preinstalled spreadsheet programs may already be on your device. Google Sheets (for Android, iOS and web) and Apple\u2019s Numbers software for iOS, macOS and web are two examples.ImageGoogle Sheets is another free spreadsheet app that includes ready-made budget worksheets and includes instructions for how to use them.CreditThe New York TimesIf you don\u2019t care for the offerings from Microsoft, Google or Apple, there are alternatives. Apache OpenOffice has a Calc spreadsheet program, as does LibreOffice, and both are free open-source suites that run on Windows, Mac and Linux systems. And there are plenty of other options in the app stores if you want to shop around.Step 2: Select a TemplateSpreadsheet programs for home computers have been around for 40 years, giving developers plenty of time to make them more intuitive. Most have a version of the \u201cpersonal budget\u201d template \u2014 with the spending categories, design and formulas already formatted. Take advantage of them. Just type over the sample numbers with your own information and the software does the math.Open your program of choice and look for the \u201cTemplate\u201d or \u201cProject\u201d gallery. Select the template that best matches your needs, like \u201cMonthly Home Budget,\u201d to create a new spreadsheet.ImageAfter you decide on a spreadsheet program, visit its template library to select the type of starter document you want to use.CreditThe New York TimesDon\u2019t see a template that suits you? With a quick search, you can find plenty more to download online, like the selection at BudgetsAreSexy.com, which has specialized templates for those aiming for early retirement, or recent college graduates. The Measure of a Plan personal finance site also has a detailed budget-tracking template that works in Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. Online video tutorials and software guides can also help you build your own spreadsheets.Step 3: Enter Your Own NumbersOnce you open a template, you\u2019ll see the boxes (called \u201ccells\u201d in spreadsheet lingo) to fill in your own numbers. Gather up pay stubs, bills, statements and any other forms that show what you made or spent that month.ImageOnce in your chosen budget template, just click into boxes (cells) and replace the sample numbers with your own. Apple's Numbers and other many programs also allow you to adjust the look of your spreadsheet.CreditThe New York TimesEnter the information into the designated place. Along with your salary, your pay stub should show the money taken out for things like taxes, retirement savings and health insurance.

Secret religious conversions. A doctorate from a mail-order diploma mill. Affairs with powerful women.The sordid list \u2014 a mixture of facts, accusations and insinuations, packaged in a glossy slide show \u2014 represents the crux of a well-orchestrated campaign by Goldman Sachs to discredit one of its former partners and to minimize the Wall Street bank\u2019s role in the looting of a big Malaysian investment fund.In recent presentations to American regulators and law enforcement authorities, according to people familiar with their contents, Goldman executives and their lawyers have depicted Tim Leissner, a former top investment banker, as a master con man, someone so sneaky that even the retired military intelligence officers who work for the bank couldn\u2019t sniff him out.The scorched-earth tactics, especially against someone who had been a star banker, reflect just how worried Goldman is about the criminal investigations into its role in the theft of at least $2.7 billion from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB, sovereign wealth fund.One big reason for concern is that senior Goldman officials, including the bank\u2019s chief executive at the time, helped win Malaysian business. And the relationship became a crucial engine of profits for the bank, generating about $600 million in fees.The bank\u2019s hope is that by casting Mr. Leissner as a rogue employee, Goldman will reduce its legal and reputational liability.On Wednesday, in a sign of how the stakes are rising, Goldman disclosed that in the fourth quarter of 2018 it set aside an additional $516 million to cover potential legal and regulatory penalties, including those related to 1MDB. And executives said Goldman could owe $2 billion on top of what it has already put in its reserves.\u201cFor Leissner\u2019s role in that fraud, we apologize to the Malaysian people,\u201d David M. Solomon, the bank\u2019s chief executive, told analysts Wednesday. \u201cAs you would expect, we have looked back and continue to look back to see if there is anything that we as a firm could have done better.\u201dA Goldman spokesman, Michael DuVally, said that since Mr. Leissner left the bank in 2016, Goldman found new violations of its internal policies \u201cthat we have shared with the Department of Justice and other relevant authorities.\u201dWhile it\u2019s not uncommon for companies to defend themselves by blaming lone employees, Goldman\u2019s ad hominem attacks on Mr. Leissner stand out for their aggressive, charged nature. The bank has not presented authorities with proof to substantiate all of its allegations, and some of them \u2014 including a focus on Mr. Leissner\u2019s supposedly converting to Islam on two occasions \u2014 are, at best, inflammatory.Mr. Leissner, 48, has been criminally charged by American and Malaysian prosecutors with bribery and money laundering in connection with the theft from 1MDB. He pleaded guilty last year to the United States charges. He is scheduled to be sentenced in June. His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment for this article.For years, Mr. Leissner was one of Goldman\u2019s most powerful dealmakers in Asia. Among other things, he helped Goldman win lucrative assignments selling bonds for 1MDB. Mr. Leissner facilitated at least one meeting between Goldman\u2019s chief executive at the time, Lloyd C. Blankfein, and a Malaysian financier named Jho Low, who subsequently was charged as the mastermind of the 1MDB theft.Goldman suspended Mr. Leissner in 2016, and the bank\u2019s executives have publicly faulted him for lying to Goldman and snaring the bank in the fraud.But in private meetings with federal and state officials and employees in recent months, Goldman has intensified its efforts to blame Mr. Leissner, according to five people familiar with the bank\u2019s campaign who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.ImageLloyd C. Blankfein, the bank\u2019s former chief executive, left, and David M. Solomon, its current chief. Mr. Blankfein helped court business in Malaysia and had at least one face-to-face meeting with the man accused of being the architect of the fraud.CreditJohn Taggart for The New York TimesIn November, for example, the bank met with federal prosecutors in Washington and delivered a lengthy PowerPoint presentation that sought to paint Mr. Leissner as a man practiced in the art of deception, according to two people familiar with the presentation.One slide in the presentation said that Mr. Leissner may have been briefly married to two women at the same time.Another slide included a photo of Mr. Leissner praying with other men, as well as images of a government-issued ID card that showed Mr. Leissner describing himself as Muslim. The people familiar with the presentation said Goldman officials used the slide to claim that Mr. Leissner twice converted to Islam in order to impress wealthy Muslim women he was dating.The inch-thick presentation also accused Mr. Leissner of having had a sexual relationship with at least one Goldman client and of having received a mail-order Ph.D. from a now-defunct university, the people said.It isn\u2019t clear what evidence Goldman has of the alleged affair, which bank officials believe took place before Mr. Leissner married the fashion designer and model Kimora Lee Simmons in 2013.In addition to the Justice Department, Goldman delivered similar multi-hour presentations to bank regulators, the people said. As well as the section seeking to discredit Mr. Leissner, the presentation outlined the vetting Goldman performed before agreeing to sell bonds for 1MDB. It also had a section on Mr. Low, including clips from news articles describing him as a promising entrepreneur and investor.In part, Goldman is using the presentation to argue that, given Mr. Leissner\u2019s supposed slipperiness, the bank\u2019s compliance system should not be faulted for failing to detect his scheme. The bank also is hoping to dissuade authorities from relying on any testimony or cooperation that Mr. Leissner might provide and that could put Goldman in a bad light.As part of his guilty plea last year, Mr. Leissner admitted to misappropriating at least $50 million from 1MDB\u2019s bond offerings and to deceiving Goldman about Mr. Low\u2019s role in those deals. But Mr. Leissner also told a federal judge that hiding his actions from Goldman\u2019s compliance department was \u201cvery much in line\u201d with a wider culture at the firm, especially in Asia.Senior executives at Goldman have been spreading the blame-the-rogue-employee message to its partners, according to six people familiar with Goldman\u2019s efforts.In December, Goldman held an annual dinner for retired partners at the Conrad Hotel in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Solomon talked about the 1MDB investigation, explaining that Goldman has muscular compliance programs but would not always be able to protect against ill-intentioned employees, according to five people who were there. They said they were struck by Mr. Solomon\u2019s bitter tone.Goldman\u2019s efforts to defend itself by attacking Mr. Leissner\u2019s behavior could raise more questions for the bank. Some Goldman executives knew about his alleged romantic relationships with clients, but the bank did not object to them until after Mr. Leissner became a target of investigations.Five current and former Goldman bankers said in interviews that they were aware of Mr. Leissner\u2019s hard-partying reputation and romantic overtures to wealthy women, including several who were executives at companies that were bank clients.Joe Ravitch, a former Goldman partner who helped hire Mr. Leissner from Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong in 1999, said it was common knowledge that Mr. Leissner was misbehaving. \u201cA lot of the people that worked for me would tell me the stories about Tim being a wild man,\u201d he said.In one case, Goldman investigated Mr. Leissner\u2019s relationship with a top female executive of a Malaysian media company, but the bank ultimately didn\u2019t take any action against Mr. Leissner, according to a Goldman official.In Malaysia, where Goldman itself has been criminally charged, prosecutors and senior government officials are unlikely to be receptive to the bank\u2019s claim that Mr. Leissner was a lone wolf.\u201cThe whole world knows that their senior executives were involved with wrongdoing and don\u2019t feel that guilty, so I think there needs to be some accountability,\u201d said Malaysia\u2019s finance minister, Lim Guan Eng, in an interview on Monday. \u201cYou have to show genuine remorse for what has happened. You must pay the penalty.\u201d"}, {"title": "On Politics: Will the Shutdown Delay the State of the Union?", "category": "Politics", "id": "f734e48e-b50e-4e43-9268-16b434b25d99", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/us/politics/shutdown-state-of-the-union.html", "publishdate": 20190117, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Thursday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today._____________________\u2022 Here\u2019s where the shutdown stands: Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent President Trump a letter asking him to scrap or delay his State of the Union address, citing security and logistical concerns; a bipartisan group of senators called on him to reopen the government; and the Trump administration is looking to reinterpret the rules of a federal shutdown to put people back to work.\u2022 Four Americans were among the 19 people killed in a bombing in northern Syria for which ISIS has claimed responsibility. The attack came just weeks after Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal of American troops from the county,  declaring that the Islamic State had been defeated.\u2022 Mr. Trump has insisted that he\u2019s not going to compromise with Democrats to end the government shutdown, and that he\u2019s comfortable with that. But privately, the president is growing increasingly anxious.\u2022 Several hundred thousand federal employees keep reporting to work even though they aren\u2019t getting paid. Lawmakers are beginning to float the idea that perhaps they shouldn\u2019t show up.\u2022 Hours before the government shutdown began, Mr. Trump scored a rare bipartisan success when he signed a criminal justice bill aimed at reducing the number of nonviolent offenders in prison. Now, the shutdown threatens to delay the law\u2019s implementation.\u2022 Republican leaders are piling on in their condemnations of Representative Steve King of Iowa, but they remain silent on similar comments by Mr. Trump.\u2022 A measure that would have forced Mr. Trump to leave sanctions in place for companies owned by Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch, fell three votes short in the Senate.\u2022 After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, lawyers for a federal agency agreed that its lease of prime Washington property to the Trump Organization, which operates a hotel there, might now violate the Constitution. But the agency ignored the issue, a report finds.\u2022 Senator Bernie Sanders met with former staff members who conveyed their dismay over mistreatment of women during his 2016 campaign, hoping to calm unrest that is shadowing his potential 2020 bid.\u2022 In Virginia, where Republicans and Democrats have embraced pro-business policies, Lee Carter, a socialist lawmaker, is fighting to change the status quo._____________________Today\u2019s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grull\u00f3n Paz in New York.Were you forwarded this newsletter?

Wages crawled up, factory jobs fled to China and benefits collapsed. But those years look less painful if you worked for Uncle Sam.Since 2000, average pay has grown twice as fast for federal employees as it has in the private sector. That\u2019s partly because the federal work force has become more educated and specialized. It is also built into the job. Even without the salaries that top performers can command in the corporate world, government workers who do well are entitled by law to regular pay increases, an increasingly rare guarantee elsewhere.Salaries for federal workers have outpaced those in the private sectorWhile the ranks of federal government workers have not expanded, their average salaries have increased more than those in the private sector. This is partly because the government employs many highly skilled professionals, like economic analysts and scientists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t#g-0117-biz-web-DC-FEDWORKERS-CHART-3-SALARIES-box .g-artboard {\n\t\tmargin:0 auto;\n\t}\n\t#g-0117-biz-web-DC-FEDWORKERS-CHART-3-SALARIES-box .g-artboard p {\n\t\tmargin:0;\n\t}\n\t.g-aiAbs {\n\t\tposition:absolute;\n\t}\n\t.g-aiImg {\n\t\tdisplay:block;\n\t\twidth:100% !important;\n\t}\n\t.g-aiSymbol {\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tbox-sizing: border-box;\n\t}\n\t.g-aiPointText p { white-space: nowrap;

Eight in 10 are outside of the Beltway. And the paychecks \u2014 which have stopped arriving during the longest United States government shutdown ever \u2014 are increasingly critical to local economies.A Typical Federal Worker Has Missed $5,000 in Pay From the Shutdown So FarThat\u2019s a total of $200 million in unpaid wages each workday.That is especially true in places that are remote and have high jobless rates, like Pocahontas County, W.Va. \u201cNatural resources abound, but job opportunities don\u2019t,\u201d said Cynthia Sandeno, a district ranger with the United States Forest Service, who oversees hundreds of thousands of acres of woodlands in the area.Ms. Sandeno, 44, manages 25 wildlife ecologists, biologists, engineers and foresters who make anywhere from $28,000 to $100,000 a year, which puts many of them at the top of the local pay scale. Their missing checks will very likely be felt far beyond their own bank accounts.Ms. Sandeno says that since they were furloughed, her staff members stopped eating out at the Dirtbean cafe or Rayetta\u2019s Lunch Box in Marlinton, a town of 1,000. \u201cThey are just normal people who don\u2019t want to file for unemployment,\u201d she says. There aren\u2019t a lot of alternatives in the area.\u201cIt\u2019s 45 miles to the closest McDonald\u2019s,\u201d she said. The shutdown also derailed Ms. Sandeno\u2019s plan to make two job offers to local residents and promote one of her employees.\u201cThose are three families that would be getting above-average pay,\u201d she said.As globalization has shuttered factories and decimated entire industries, federal employment has been a bastion of stability. It has not grown, and occupies a shrinking share of the overall labor market, but it remains an equalizer for African-Americans and women, who are far more likely to earn high salaries working for the government than they would with a company.Federal employment has been stable for decadesSince the 1960s, the number of federal government jobs has remained relatively flat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t#g-0117-biz-web-DC-FEDWORKERS-CHART-2-JOB-CHANGE-box .g-artboard {\n\t\tmargin:0 auto;\n\t}\n\t#g-0117-biz-web-DC-FEDWORKERS-CHART-2-JOB-CHANGE-box .g-artboard p {\n\t\tmargin:0;\n\t}\n\t.g-aiAbs {\n\t\tposition:absolute;\n\t}\n\t.g-aiImg {\n\t\tdisplay:block;\n\t\twidth:100% !important;\n\t}\n\t.g-aiSymbol {\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tbox-sizing: border-box;\n\t}\n\t.g-aiPointText p { white-space: nowrap;

The ranks include Veterans Health Administration pharmacy technicians in Mississippi earning $43,000 a year, and lawyers for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington pulling down $200,000.Federal employees on average earn higher salaries than private sector workers, partly because they are far more likely to have advanced degrees, and they\u2019re older.

That\u2019s less than you would have made in 2011, after inflation. The decline is partly because of a three-year federal salary freeze under President Barack Obama starting in 2011, followed by 1 percent raises for four years.\u201cPeople are worse off than they were at the beginning of the decade,\u201d said Jacqueline Simon, the policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union representing 700,000 workers.But the reality is that people who have held onto their government jobs for many years have not languished in the same role at the same pay grade. They have progressed up the ladder and benefited from regular raises at least every few years. They all have pensions and almost all have health insurance, perks that are harder to come by as an employee in corporate America.Education plays a role in the pay disparitiesFederal workers, on the whole, tend to be more educated than those in the private sector. Comparing workers with similar educations shows that, at lower levels, federal workers are paid more than their counterparts in the private sector. At the highest levels of education, though, private-sector workers are paid more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t#g-0117-biz-web-DC-FEDWORKERS-CHART-4-EDUCATION-box .g-artboard {\n\t\tmargin:0 auto;\n\t}\n\t#g-0117-biz-web-DC-FEDWORKERS-CHART-4-EDUCATION-box .g-artboard p {\n\t\tmargin:0;\n\t}\n\t.g-aiAbs {\n\t\tposition:absolute;\n\t}\n\t.g-aiImg {\n\t\tdisplay:block;\n\t\twidth:100% !important;\n\t}\n\t.g-aiSymbol {\n\t\tposition: absolute;\n\t\tbox-sizing: border-box;\n\t}\n\t.g-aiPointText p { white-space: nowrap;

Then, over the next decade or so, she climbed four levels in the ranks of the federal work force. \u201cThose were big pay jumps,\u201d she said. In 2017, Ms. Bloomfield got a promotion that put her salary at $78,000 a year, a comfortable sum in Tulsa.Unions and conservative groups often argue whether people like Ms. Bloomfield are overpaid or undercompensated. Many of those at the high end of the scale could command even bigger salaries on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley \u2014 and estimates that break down pay by occupation have shown that the government pays less than companies do for similar work.Ms. Bloomfield would take stability over a six-figure salary in the private sector any day. Her brother earns much more than she does in technical support in Austin, Tex. But he\u2019s had to switch employers multiple times in the last 20 years because of corporate restructuring and layoffs.\u201cEven though he makes a high wage, he has to live with this uncertainty,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that stress.\u201dSteve Fosse, a revenue agent with the I.R.S., isn\u2019t sure whether that trade-off is worth it anymore. The first person in his family to graduate from college, Mr. Fosse, 39, took a job with the government because it offered reliability. \u201cI wanted the benefits and the guaranteed paychecks,\u201d he said.ImageSteve Fosse, a revenue agent with the Internal Revenue Service, has a salary that goes a long way in North Dakota. But without an income during the government shutdown, he is having second thoughts about the job\u2019s advantages.CreditDan Koeck for The New York TimesFor the most part, that dream panned out. Mr. Fosse earns $90,000 a year, a comfortable sum that helped him buy a four-bedroom home in West Fargo, N.D. He doesn\u2019t exactly indulge in luxuries \u2014 his newest car is a used Toyota Sienna that has logged 170,000 miles \u2014 but he hasn\u2019t lost much sleep over where his next few paychecks will come from. Until now.Mr. Fosse is furloughed and has begun selling everything he can \u2014 an old television, a stationary bicycle, a snow blower \u2014 on Craigslist. He\u2019s mulling a move to a public accounting firm in Minneapolis, where his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 could probably land him a salary above $120,000. He\u2019d miss his pension, and the feeling that he\u2019s doing something that, on balance, helps people.But 14 years into his career, he\u2019s having doubts.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to serve the United States,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t like feeling like I am getting pushed to a bread line in order to continue doing that.\u201d"}, {"title": "Huawei Said to Be Under U.S. Investigation in Trade-Secrets Case", "category": "Business", "id": "5e26f011-6917-445a-80dd-9ef1ae7a0c62", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/technology/huawei-investigation-trade-secrets.html", "publishdate": 20190117, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/business/17huaweiPRINT/merlin_148905969_856d8e37-3ede-4747-8c5c-28d92c8e3c4a-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal prosecutors in Seattle are investigating Huawei, the Chinese technology giant, on allegations of intellectual property theft, according to two people familiar with the case.The criminal investigation is related to a civil suit between Huawei, one of the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment and smartphone makers, and the telecom provider T-Mobile, according to the two people, who requested anonymity because they were discussing an active investigation.In that civil case, filed in 2014, Huawei was accused of stealing intellectual property related to a robot that T-Mobile used to diagnose quality control issues in mobile phones. A jury found Huawei guilty in May 2017.The criminal inquiry is looking at some of the same issues as the civil case, according to one of the people with knowledge of the investigation.A Huawei spokesman declined to comment Wednesday evening, as did a spokesman for T-Mobile. The investigation was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.The inquiry in Seattle is unrelated to the federal government\u2019s efforts to extradite Meng Wanzhou, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, who was arrested in Canada at the request of the United States in early December.Federal prosecutors believe Ms. Meng, a daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, misled banks about Huawei\u2019s business in Iran, causing them to violate American sanctions on Iran inadvertently. She has been living under surveillance in Canada while the authorities decide whether she will be extradited to the United States.Separately, Huawei last week fired an employee who was arrested in Poland and charged with spying for the Chinese government. The employee, Wang Weijing, had worked at the Chinese Consulate in Gdansk, Poland, before joining Huawei in its public relations and sales departments. The company fired him a day after his arrest was announced and said his actions were unrelated to the company.Taken together, the cases underscore the United States intelligence community\u2019s primary fears about China and its largest companies. Law enforcement officials have long said that Chinese companies and state-sponsored entities steal trade secrets to bolster China\u2019s economy and corporations and that companies close to Beijing will break laws to advance the government\u2019s political goals.Lawmakers are also pressuring Huawei. A new bill introduced on Wednesday would ban the export of American technology to Chinese telecommunications companies that have broken U.S. sanctions, including Huawei and its smaller Chinese rival ZTE.Because the companies make wide use of an array of American parts, like microchips, the bill could have a major impact on their business. A similar ban last year, following a finding that ZTE had violated American sanctions, effectively shut the Chinese company down before the Trump administration lifted it.\u201cBoth companies have repeatedly violated U.S. laws, represent a significant risk to American national security interests and need to be held accountable,\u201d said Chris Van Hollen, a Democratic senator from Maryland and one of the sponsors of the bill, in a statement.The bill, called the Telecommunications Denial Order Enforcement Act, was also sponsored in the Senate by Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas. In the House of Representatives, it was sponsored by Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican, and Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat.The charges in Seattle had hung over Huawei for much of last year, as various other crises were unfolding for the company. The charges were due to pass the statute of limitations last year, but the case was extended.In plea negotiations last year, Huawei faced the prospect of pleading guilty to a criminal charge of theft of a trade secret and agreeing to some sort of compliance plan, according to one of the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.If the case is resolved with a plea agreement, Huawei will most likely plead guilty to a criminal charge of theft of a trade secret and have to agree to some sort of compliance plan, the person said.Huawei is a banner for immense national pride in China. But the United States has long eyed the company with suspicion. Large American cellular carriers have shunned Huawei\u2019s gear for many years.Pressure on the company has risen sharply over the last year. The authorities in Britain, the Czech Republic, Canada and elsewhere have taken a more critical look at Huawei as mobile carriers prepare to upgrade the technology in their networks. Australia has already barred the company from providing equipment to support its fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless networks.Huawei executives have longed denied that the company acts on behalf of any government. But American counterintelligence agents and federal prosecutors have for some time explored possible cases against the company\u2019s leadership.The T-Mobile lawsuit was not the first time Huawei had been accused of stealing intellectual property. In 2003, the company admitted it had stolen portions of the software that runs computer networking equipment from Cisco Systems, one of the largest tech companies in Silicon Valley.Cisco dropped a patent infringement lawsuit in exchange for a promise from Huawei to modify some of its products."}, {"title": "New York Magazine Names a New Editor as Adam Moss Departs", "category": "Business", "id": "0d4e09ef-5be2-4cc6-a79f-4151748ea951", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/business/media/david-haskell-new-york-magazine-editor.html", "publishdate": 20190117, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/business/17NYMAG/merlin_149279343_a645588b-565c-4aa1-b8cb-250ef4fbf720-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "David Haskell, a longtime deputy editor at New York magazine, will become its editor in chief on April 1, inheriting a glossy biweekly and a suite of websites devoted to pursuits like fashion, food, shopping and politics. He succeeds Adam Moss, who is stepping down after 15 years at the helm.The appointment of Mr. Haskell, 39, on Wednesday is a sea change for a publication that has reached journalistic heights under Mr. Moss \u2014 collecting dozens of National Magazine Awards and, last year, a Pulitzer Prize \u2014 even as it struggled to find financial stability in a topsy-turvy environment for the news industry.Mr. Moss, working with the company\u2019s chief executive, Pamela Wasserstein, reinvented New York as a digital company dabbling in e-commerce, TV spinoffs and live events. Since 2016, Mr. Haskell has split his duties between editing (one of his projects, celebrities\u2019 stories of moving to the city, became a book) and imagining the future of the business.\u201cI feel so grateful for the opportunity, and obviously so daunted,\u201d Mr. Haskell said in an interview on Wednesday, shortly before an address to the staff. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s a student of narratives knows how dangerous it is to take something over at the top of its game.\u201dA prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Moss, Mr. Haskell is the sort of professionally omnivorous, type-A New Yorker who might merit a feature in his magazine\u2019s pages.He is a ceramist and sculptor, with gallery representation in TriBeCa. (His gallerist calls his work \u201can exploration of the natural world via wheel-thrown forms.\u201d) He is a part-time whiskey maker who hosts barbecues at the distillery he co-founded in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He studied architectural history at Cambridge University after college at Yale, where he sang in the a cappella group the Whiffenpoofs.Oh, and he works in magazines, too.After cofounding Topic, a cult favorite print publication, in his early 20s, Mr. Haskell joined New York magazine in 2007. He edits much of the political coverage and later worked closely with Ms. Wasserstein on podcasts, book projects and a new shopping site, The Strategist.In his new role, Mr. Haskell faces some uncertainty. Ms. Wasserstein, whose family owns New York Media, the magazine\u2019s parent company, has spoken with potential financial partners, though no deal appears imminent. Recently, the staff formed a union and an online paywall was introduced.\u201cI don\u2019t really know a time in magazine journalism that hasn\u2019t been terrifying,\u201d Mr. Haskell said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I know. And in the midst of all of it, we have continued to put out work that has made me so proud.\u201dOn the matter of the union, he said, \u201cI\u2019m happy for the staff.

The company said it planned to take a write-off of 300 billion yen, or $2.75 billion, on the projects.The decision by Hitachi is a blow to the British government, which is betting heavily on nuclear installations to help meet the country\u2019s electric power needs in the coming decades.The big question is whether Hitachi\u2019s move will be a death knell for Britain\u2019s campaign to build nuclear plants, which so far has resulted in only one project under construction.While there are signs that the government is rethinking its energy policy, it was willing to go a long way toward trying to keep Hitachi on board.In a statement to Parliament on Thursday, Greg Clark, the secretary of state for business and energy, said the government had been willing to consider providing one-third of the equity financing for the project and to take on all of the construction debt. When Hitachi continued to balk, Mr. Clark said, \u201cI was not prepared to ask the taxpayer to take on a larger share.\u201dThe Hitachi plant would have been a big boost for the struggling local economy in North Wales, providing up to 850 permanent jobs.Anglesey Island, where the plant, called Wylfa Newydd, was to be built, will most likely feel the harshest impact. Llinos Medi, leader of the Anglesey Council, the local government authority on the island, said in a statement that she was concerned about the suspension\u2019s \u201cimmediate impact on local men and women whose employment is at risk as a consequence of this suspension.\u201dFor Hitachi, though, the announcement could mark the end of a long and expensive saga. The company acquired the Horizon sites from two German utilities in 2012 for \u00a3697 million, or about $900 million, and wound up spending around \u00a32 billion in total on design approvals, staff and other matters. It has been hiring apprentices, who have been training at a technical college on the island and going to Spain and Japan for work experience. At times in recent months more than 100 archaeologists were on the site, excavating and recording ancient structures that the construction would have destroyed.Hitachi hoped Britain would prove to be an international showcase for its reactor designs. Ultimately, the company lost patience with the high level of spending required to land such a project there.Hitachi had sought to arrive at a financial arrangement that would attract long-term investors like pension funds to the project and reduce its own exposure. But the offers of support from both the British and the Japanese sides were not enough.In an interview on Thursday, Duncan Hawthorne, Horizon\u2019s chief executive, said the Wales site was very attractive and had a supportive community, but that alone, he added, is not enough to attract outside investment.Investors, Mr. Hawthorne said, were put off by the eight- to 10-year wait for a return, as well as the risks of cost overruns and other issues. With the project gaining momentum and spending rising, \u201cit became too much for Hitachi to keep going,\u201d he said.Mr. Hawthorne said Hitachi would prefer to return to Britain as a supplier rather than a developer taking on large upfront risks.In his statement, Mr. Clark said it was clear that the government needed to consider a new approach to financing large nuclear projects. He also said the government was considering supporting small nuclear reactors, including a consortium led by Rolls-Royce, the British jet engine maker.Hitachi\u2019s stepping back from Britain leaves France\u2019s state-controlled EDF Group and its Chinese partner, CGN, as the only companies pursuing nuclear power projects in the country. EDF, through a British subsidiary, owns Britain\u2019s operating nuclear power plants; with CGN, it is building Britain\u2019s first nuclear plant since the 1990s in southwest England at a cost of \u00a320 billion. CGN wants to build a plant in eastern England.China now has by far the world\u2019s largest nuclear building program, but it is largely domestic. CGN would like to use Britain as a steppingstone to an international nuclear business, though there is skepticism in Britain about relying on companies tied to Beijing for a strategically important service like electric power.The dwindling number of companies willing to make the huge investments required to develop nuclear plants also reflects the falling costs of renewable energy sources, like solar and offshore wind.\u201cThe economics of the energy market have changed significantly in recent years,\u201d Mr. Clark said, with the cost of renewables trending downward and those for nuclear plants rising.Antony Froggatt, a nuclear analyst at Chatham House, a research organization, noted that nuclear energy was costly and controversial, and that having a foreign company like Hitachi build a plant in Britain was unlikely to contribute to building a British industry.\u201cFor all those reasons,\u201d he said, \u201cnuclear falls away.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: Larry Fink Asks C.E.O.s to Lead a Divided World", "category": "Business", "id": "ce965672-1bb7-4531-a045-3970a1010ccd", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/business/dealbook/larry-fink-letter-business-leaders.html", "publishdate": 20190117, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/18/business/18db-fink/merlin_146221389_10e594aa-2e6b-4fde-aa96-a79b453c70bc-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Thursday morning.

And executives said the bank could owe another $2 billion.More banking news: Goldman reported a rise in fourth-quarter profit to $2.54 billion, or $6.04 a share, from a year ago, easily beating analysts\u2019 expectations.

He had urged me to reach out to him \u201canytime I needed him,\u201d and I took him up on that offer regularly.This time, it took a while to reach him. When I finally got through, he immediately apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve been having a hard time,\u201d he said. I replied I was sorry to hear that and asked what the problem was.\u201cIt\u2019s my heart,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve reached me in the hospital.\u201dJack was 83 then. Sixteen years earlier, after six heart attacks, he\u2019d had a heart transplant. That was no secret. \u201cI\u2019ve got a young man\u2019s heart,\u201d he would say. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful.\u201dBut now, Jack told me that his body periodically reacted against the heart, and that he sometimes needed urgent treatment. This was one of those times.\u201cIt\u2019s happened before,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right. And now, what can I do for you?\u201dWe talked at length, and his voice got stronger as he launched into a lecture on \u201cthe relentless rules of arithmetic\u201d for mutual funds. He said they amounted to this: The fees charged by brokerages, fund companies and advisers were sapping the returns of millions of hard-working people who were trying to save for retirement. Reduce the fees and give the money to the people who need it, he said. That, he said, was what his career was all about.After a few minutes, he faltered, and we agreed to resume the conversation a week or two later. Jack asked me not to reveal that stretch of weakness and hospitalization \u2014 or other bouts that occurred later \u2014 and I didn\u2019t, while he was alive.Now, after the announcement of his death on Wednesday, I believe it\u2019s fair to let people know how strong he was, and how idealistic.[Read the obituary of Mr. Bogle.]The basic biographical details are well known. A poor boy and a brilliant student, he discovered an interest in asset management \u2014 and the burden of fees on investors \u2014 while an undergraduate at Princeton. He had his ups and downs in the fund business but made history by popularizing the index fund and creating Vanguard, giving up his chance at great wealth by eschewing ownership of the company.The Vanguard Group, as he structured it, was owned by its mutual funds, which were owned, in turn, by fund shareholders and dedicated to low-cost investing. He was paid well and accrued what would be a great fortune for most of us \u2014 he told me last year his assets were \u201cwell below $100 million\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s small change by the standards of money management.Consider that Vanguard says today it has $4.9 trillion under management. If Jack Bogle, and his heirs, were the main shareholders of a company as large and profitable as Vanguard, they would surely be billionaires many times over.Jack was proud he was not a billionaire, though he didn\u2019t say so publicly.\u201cI feel funny about it,\u201d he told me. After all, in the United States, titans of industry are supposed to be rich. People are so often measured by the size of their financial assets, he said, and his were not really awesome.\u201cI don\u2019t share those values,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve still been influenced by them.\u201d In fact, he said, he was sure some rich people wouldn\u2019t really respect him if they knew he wasn\u2019t as wealthy as they were.But that\u2019s the point, of course. He built something bigger than personal wealth: a reasonable way for great masses of people to get a more equitable share of the world\u2019s financial pie.His index funds have multiplied at Vanguard and been copied and transformed by many others. The funds aren\u2019t perfect. Jack acknowledged that if index funds became dominant enough, they might distort the marketplace. That is a problem others will have to deal with.He wasn\u2019t a doctrinaire indexer, either. In his personal portfolio, Jack held shares of actively managed funds, including Vanguard\u2019s Wellington fund, founded by his mentor and former boss, Walter L. Morgan. But Wellington\u2019s fees have always been low and are now only 0.17 percent, according to Morningstar, among the lowest for any actively managed fund.As Jack told me in 2012: \u201cMy ideas are very simple. In investing, you get what you don\u2019t pay for.\u201d He popularized those ideas, and put them into practice, at some personal sacrifice.We owe him for all of the fees we\u2019re not paying for."}, {"title": "Facebook Identifies Russia-Linked Misinformation Campaign", "category": "Business", "id": "c9cbf100-1dd7-45ec-8504-efd52492c4cf", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/business/facebook-misinformation-russia.html", "publishdate": 20190117, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/18/world/18Facebook/merlin_145169277_92631bcc-c2f1-4f13-818a-e6a8c1174699-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LONDON \u2014 Facebook identified two disinformation campaigns originating from Russia \u2014 including one tied to an agency controlled by the Kremlin \u2014 that were targeted at users in Europe and Central Asia. The company said on Thursday it had deleted nearly 500 pages and accounts that had posted the misleading messages.Many of the pages were discovered to be linked to employees of Sputnik, an agency controlled by the Russian government that was established to spread reports and information sympathetic to Russia. It used independent news pages on topics like weather, travel and sports to mask its efforts, Facebook said.The company has been under pressure to more aggressively address the spread of misinformation, and to counter manipulation on its social network that is aimed at stirring division and discord, ever since it became evident that Russia used it to target groups of voters, sow division and spread false information in order to sway the 2016 presidential election. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, has said the detection of suspicious activity is a top priority.But on a platform of two billion users, disinformation campaigns are hard to detect, and Facebook remains a gathering ground for groups eager to spread disinformation to the widest audience possible.The activity revealed by Facebook shows how Kremlin-linked groups continue to use the social network to spread misleading materials around the world. Several of the countries targeted share a border with Russia.\u201cWe are constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don\u2019t want our services to be used to manipulate people,\u201d Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cybersecurity policy at Facebook, said in a blog post.The discovery provides another glimpse of the manipulative tactics used by groups to promote their articles, videos, groups and other content on Facebook. Fake accounts were created in different countries with the sole purpose of sharing content from Sputnik.Facebook said one of the campaigns had targeted people in 13 countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Facebook deleted 289 pages and 75 accounts linked to that effort, which also spent about $135,000 on Facebook advertising from 2013 to this month.About 790,000 users followed one or more of the pages, and up to 1,200 people expressed interest in attending one of the roughly 190 events organized by those behind the fake pages. Facebook couldn\u2019t say whether any of the events had taken place.The company said the misleading content aimed to influence people in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.Facebook said it had shared information about the investigation with United States authorities, Congress, other technology companies and policymakers in the targeted countries.Ben Nimmo, a research fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank that analyzes misinformation online, said Facebook\u2019s decision to block Sputnik-linked accounts was significant because of the agency\u2019s direct ties to the Kremlin.\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen a takedown of this scale linked directly to the national propaganda channel,\u201d said Mr. Nimmo, who was part of a group at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab that had been investigating the Russian campaign separately from Facebook. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had something that was so directly traced back to Sputnik itself.\u201dIn Moscow, Sputnik accused Facebook of \u201ccensorship,\u201d saying that the platform had blocked seven pages that belonged to newsrooms in different countries and calling the decision \u201cpolitical,\u201d according to an article by RIA Novosti, another branch of Russia\u2019s propaganda apparatus.\u201cSputnik is dealing with news,\u201d the organization said. \u201cIf blocking is the only reaction Facebook can come up with in response to the quality work of news media, then we have no further questions.\u201dThe statement also said Sputnik hoped that \u201ccommon sense will prevail.\u201dThe Atlantic Council said the pages were a covert attempt to amplify messages from Sputnik, a division of the Kremlin\u2019s media agency, Rossiya Segodnya. All told, the inauthentic network helped Sputnik raise its reach in the countries covered by more than 170 percent, according to the Atlantic Council.Much of the posted material was innocuous content about weather, fashion and local celebrities, but some presented negative views toward NATO and the treatment of ethnic Russians in Baltic countries. Most of the pages didn\u2019t mention a connection with Rossiya Segodnya or Sputnik.\u201cThis therefore appears to have been an attempt to audience build and draw users\u2019 attention to Sputnik as a media brand rather than to manipulate them with Russian political or geopolitical messaging,\u201d the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab said in a report published separately from Facebook.The work appeared to be coordinated. On a single day in October 2017, the Atlantic Council said, inauthentic pages seeking to spread Sputnik content were created to focus on Armenia, Chechnya, Estonia, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. At other points, fan pages purporting to support the presidents of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan were created, but they were actually run from Russia.Facebook also identified a separate effort, discovered after a tip from United States law enforcement authorities, aimed at users in Ukraine, a frequent target of Moscow misinformation campaigns over the four-year confrontation between the two neighboring countries.The tactics used by those behind the Ukraine-targeted accounts were similar to the misinformation efforts conducted by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency during the campaign for the recent midterm elections in the United States, Facebook said.The effort included 107 Facebook pages, groups and accounts, as well as 41 Instagram accounts.\u201cThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Mr. Gleicher said of the shutdowns.Facebook has discovered several coordinated misinformation campaigns since the 2016 presidential election, when Russia-linked groups used the social network to reach 126 million users.In November, Facebook said it had blocked more than 100 Facebook and Instagram posts over concern they were linked to the Internet Research Agency. In August, Facebook also removed 652 fake accounts, pages and groups originating in Russia and Iran that were trying to spread misinformation.The actions are a shift from when Facebook was widely criticized for failing to detect Russian interference. Facebook executives have said the company is making progress, but also warn of a protracted and challenging battle as groups become more sophisticated at avoiding detection.\u201cGet used to this,\u201d Mr. Nimmo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Facebook. It\u2019s going to be all the platforms. This is the new normal.\u201d"}, {"title": "Steve King Still Has Backing in Iowa, but Even Supporters Say \u2018He\u2019s Done\u2019", "category": "Politics", "id": "7f874512-8ac1-450b-a6f1-8efbdb60d16f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/us/politics/steve-king-iowa-supporters-white-supremacy.html", "publishdate": 20190117, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/18/us/politics/18steveking1-print/merlin_149285529_2ec22ae9-ad95-4d02-8aaa-dcd2b1b185c8-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "FORT DODGE, Iowa \u2014 The coffee crew at Zakeer\u2019s still likes Steve King. They voted for him over and over and don\u2019t believe he is a bigot. They say he\u2019s getting a raw deal from the news media and Republicans in Washington.But here\u2019s the thing: These rock-solid supporters of Mr. King, whose comments seeming to endorse white supremacy brought stinging rebukes from his own party leaders, are also convinced that his 16-year career in Congress representing northwest Iowa is effectively over.\u201cI think he\u2019s dead in the water,\u201d said Pat Reed, a retired history teacher in a purple University of Northern Iowa sweatshirt, reacting to the news that House Republicans this week had stripped Mr. King of his positions on the Agriculture and Judiciary Committees.\u201cI think he\u2019s done,\u201d echoed Ross Nemitz, the owner of Ross\u2019s Appliance Center in Fort Dodge, a small blue-collar city in the heart of Mr. King\u2019s district full of agribusinesses.Every rural Iowa community has its Zakeer\u2019s, a cafe with a table of early morning regulars \u2014 a Greek chorus speaking with a collective voice on dramas playing out on the local and national stage.The men at Zakeer\u2019s have had breakfast together for more than 20 years. They keep attendance logs and play a game of chance to see who picks up the coffee tab. (On Wednesday the loser was an out-of-town reporter.)For Mr. King, 69, losing the chorus at Zakeer\u2019s spells deep trouble. A copy of The Des Moines Register on a table displayed a top-of-the-page headline, \u201cHouse rebukes King.\u201d It upstaged the story of Gov. Kim Reynolds\u2019s State of the State speech.Mr. King was also the top story on WHO, a conservative talk radio station broadcasting across much of his vast, 39-county district of corn and soybean fields, whose black furrows lay under two inches of snow.John Kilmer, a retired truck-driver listening from an adjacent table, who had voted for Mr. King in the midterms, said now he must resign. \u201cThey\u2019ve stripped him of his committees and he\u2019s just taking up space,\u201d he said.Image\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed by him,\u201d said Amy Presler, 48, a librarian in Fort Dodge.CreditKathryn Gamble for The New York TimesAnd it wasn\u2019t just voters who think Mr. King\u2019s career is nearing an end: Republican officials are already planning to move past him, and are busy recruiting and raising money for primary challengers in 2020 if he does not step down.Mr. King says he has no plans to seek \u201canother line of work,\u201d as Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, recommended this week. He pushed back on Wednesday in a fund-raising letter to supporters, writing that \u201cthe unhinged Left has teamed up with Republican \u2018NeverTrumpers\u2019 and is pulling out all the stops to destroy me.\u201dHe attacked The New York Times, which published a quotation from him in an article last week that led to the firestorm in Congress.\u201cWhite nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u201d Mr. King told The Times, comments he now says were taken out of context.Some longtime supporters in Mr. King\u2019s Fourth District said that even if the nine-term congressman defiantly stays on, they will most likely back a primary challenger. Two candidates announced this week that they would jump into the race, including a prominent Republican state lawmaker, Randy Feenstra, and others are expected.The Fort Dodge Messenger, which in November endorsed Mr. King over his Democratic challenger, J.D. Scholten, issued an unusual correction on Wednesday night calling on Mr. King to resign.\u201cIt is now clear that the endorsement we made was a mistake,\u201d the editorial board wrote. \u201cWe should have pondered more carefully King\u2019s pattern of making outrageous statements.\u201dThere are many reasons Mr. King has been re-elected repeatedly despite years of white identity politics and demeaning comments about Hispanic immigrants, whom he has compared to dogs, dirt and drug mules \u201cwith calves the size of cantaloupes.\u201dThe most basic reason may be the deeply conservative nature of his district, where Republicans almost always triumph: President Trump carried it by 27 points. Mr. King\u2019s conservatism on abortion and gun rights lines up with a majority of his constituents, as does his reputation as an outsider defying the party establishment.ImageOpponents of Mr. King, and even some of his supporters, have long been frustrated by the impression he gives to non-Iowans who think his 16 years in office prove that his constituents are racists.CreditKathryn Gamble for The New York TimesSome supporters said the rebuke by party leaders in Washington and Des Moines would only increase his appeal and backfire on those hoping he leaves Congress.\u201cNow that they\u2019ve stripped him of his committee assignments, I\u2019ve seen people dig in their heels and say, \u2018No, Congressman King is one of us, Congressman King is a pro-life, pro-gun, pro-conservative person, just like we are,\u2019\u201d said Jacob Hall, who leads an activist group, Sioux County Conservatives.Mr. Hall disputed the notion that Mr. King\u2019s latest comments about white supremacy would move many votes one way or the other.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing anybody is going to hear Congressman King say that\u2019s going to change their mind about him, whether they\u2019re a supporter or a detractor,\u201d he said. \u201cOur minds are made up in the Fourth District.\u201dBut the results of November\u2019s midterms call into question that view. Mr. King barely squeaked out a three-point victory, after winning by 23 points two years earlier. His support plummeted late in the race after he endorsed a Toronto mayoral candidate with neo-Nazi ties and met with members of a far-right Austrian party accused of trivializing the Holocaust. The chairman of the House Republican election committee issued a stinging rebuke of him a week before the election, labeling him a white supremacist.Many Iowa Republican officials fear that if Mr. King is on the ballot in November 2020, he will drive up Democratic turnout, threatening other Republicans running, especially Senator Joni Ernst.\u201cDown-ballot and up-ballot he\u2019s definitely a liability,\u201d said Dane Nealson, a former Republican chairman of Story County, the largest and most Democratic county in Mr. King\u2019s district.Ms. Ernst may be vulnerable even if Mr. King is not running, after distancing herself from him only this week, as did Iowa\u2019s senior senator, Charles E. Grassley, and Governor Reynolds. Each had spent years embracing Mr. King because they needed his conservative base of voters.\u201cGrassley, Joni Ernst, Kim Reynolds, they could have taken a stance on this years ago,\u201d said Troy Price, chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party. \u201cIt\u2019s appalling; it\u2019s a failure of leadership on their part.\u201dImageDane Nealson, a former Republican chairman of Story County, said he thinks Mr. King is a liability to other G.O.P. candidates on the ballot in 2020.CreditKathryn Gamble for The New York TimesOpponents of Mr. King, and even some of his supporters, have long been frustrated by the impression he gives to non-Iowans who think his 16 years in office prove that his constituents are racists.\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed by him,\u201d said Amy Presler, 48, a librarian in Fort Dodge, who grew up on a farm as the youngest of 10 siblings. \u201cI don\u2019t want people in the nation and the world to think that Iowans are behind him and support that sort of talk. We don\u2019t.\u201dMr. King\u2019s racist remarks over the years have mainly been directed at undocumented Latino immigrants. He was years ahead of Mr. Trump in calling for a concrete border wall, in demonizing migrants as violent criminals and opposing any plan to legalize \u201cDreamers\u201d as a form of amnesty.Mike McCarville, a former Fort Dodge mayor, said that when it came to the many Latinos who work in meatpacking, construction and agriculture in the region, native-born Iowans could be \u201ctwo-faced.\u2019\u2019\u201cAll the farmers will bitch about all the Hispanics,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they hire them and we can\u2019t get along without them.\u201d\u201cIf they accomplished what they say they want and just round them all up and ship them back, our economy would grind to a halt,\u201d he added.On Monday, after House Republicans stripped Mr. King of his committee assignments, Lorena Lopez, the publisher of La Prensa, a Spanish-language newspaper in the district, received a flood of texts and emails from readers. \u201cEvery Latino knows how he has been, his negative comments especially against Latinos,\u201d she said.The response of the Latino community, she said, has been simple: \u201cIt is about time.\u201dBack at Zakeer\u2019s, the coffee crew said that Mr. King\u2019s loss of committee assignments means the Fourth District now has no seat at the table in Congress.\u201cNo matter how much you may like the guy, if that person can\u2019t represent you as well because he\u2019s been stripped of powers \u2026\u201d began Mr. Nemitz, the appliance dealer.Mr. Reed, the retired schoolteacher, finished the sentence: \u201cThen there isn\u2019t much sense of being there.\u201d"}, {"title": "Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Political Flex", "category": "Politics", "id": "0acced45-8704-4f1f-b247-3a48c6a36c1c", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/us/politics/on-politics-pelosi-trump.html", "publishdate": 20190117, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/us/politics/17onpolitics-Pelosi/17onpolitics-Pelosi-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.[Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]We\u2019re less than a month into the new Congress, but one thing has already become clear: Don\u2019t mess with Nancy.Over the past week, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been flexing her muscle all over Washington. The latest, and perhaps most glaring, example came on Wednesday, when Ms. Pelosi requested that President Trump delay \u2014 or skip altogether \u2014 his State of the Union address.\u201cThe date of the State of the Union is not a sacred date. It\u2019s not constitutionally required; it\u2019s not any president\u2019s birthday; it\u2019s not anything,\u201d she told reporters this morning. \u201cIt is a date that we agreed to \u2014 it could have been the week later.\u201dHer comments clearly got under the president\u2019s skin. Late Thursday afternoon, he revoked her military transport for a secret trip to Afghanistan \u2014 a visit to a war zone that Mr. Trump derided as a \u201cpublic relations event.\u201d He suggested Ms. Pelosi, second in line for the presidency, fly commercial. To Afghanistan.Ms. Pelosi\u2019s aides and supporters quickly pointed out that her plans included thanking the troops and meeting with the commanders of the war that Mr. Trump is trying to end. Mr. Trump, in fact, made his first visit to a warzone during this same shutdown.Now, none of the fighting over flights gets the country any closer to ending a government shutdown that\u2019s crippling the finances of 800,000 federal workers and starting to have economic impacts far bigger than even the White House anticipated.But it is some awfully crafty politics by Ms. Pelosi.A 78-year-old, wealthy San Francisco liberal, Ms. Pelosi is nobody\u2019s idea of an everyman politician. Forget fast food \u2014 Ms. Pelosi eats dark chocolate ice cream for breakfast. Her campaign superpower involves twisting the arms of rich donors. She doesn\u2019t really use Twitter, never mind Instagram.And yet, right now, she might just be the most powerful politician in the country.Dozens of Democrats spent months campaigning against supporting Ms. Pelosi as speaker. (Worth noting: G.O.P. attacks on her far outpaced mentions of any other congressional leader in campaign ads for the last three cycles.) In the end, after a weekslong campaign by Ms. Pelosi put down any hint of rebellion, only 15 members cast ballots against her.Now, she\u2019s getting her revenge, wielding one of the most powerful tools in her disposal: committee assignments.Ms. Pelosi kept Representative Kathleen Rice\u2019s name off the list of suggested members for the Judiciary Committee, a powerful spot that will be at the center of investigations into Mr. Trump \u2014 and any possible impeachment. Ms. Rice was one of Ms. Pelosi\u2019s most outspoken critics.Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, who pushed against Ms. Pelosi but ultimately voted for her for speaker, got a perch on the influential Financial Services Committee, a particularly plum assignment for a freshman member.It\u2019s yet another savvy move by Ms. Pelosi to help keep a restive progressive caucus on her side \u2014 a unity that\u2019ll be crucially important for the battles with Mr. Trump that are sure to come.[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.]____________________Wait, can they do that?Divided government, a special counsel investigation, the longest government shutdown in history, the biggest Democratic primary field in decades, secretive meetings with Russia \u2014 at this point in the Trump administration, we\u2019ve written \u201cunprecedented\u201d so much that it\u2019s become a clich\u00e9.

This is, \u201cWait, can they do that?\u201dOur first topic: Speaker Nancy Pelosi asking President Trump to scrap or delay his State of the Union address.Can she do that? Well, yes, actually.The Constitution mandates some kind of update from our chief executive, saying the president \u201cshall from time to time give to the Congress information of the state of the union, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\u201dBut notice what it doesn\u2019t mention: Cable commentary, invited guests and a walk down the red carpet\u2014 er, the aisle of the House floor.After George Washington gave the first address on Jan. 8, 1790, in New York, the practice continued for about a decade. In 1801, eager to simplify what he thought was a monarchal tradition, Thomas Jefferson mailed in copies to both houses of Congress that were read by the chamber\u2019s clerks.It went that way for more than a century, until Woodrow Wilson revived the in-person address in 1913 (though presidents continued to occasionally submit their speeches in writing; Jimmy Carter was the last to do it, in 1981). The fact that it has become a prime-time spectacle over the last 50 years is mostly a product of modern media \u2014 and political ego.____________________Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers.

Mr. Jones seemed to offer a model, rejecting labels like progressive or conservative and calling himself a \u201cDoug Jones Democrat.\u201dNow, as the longest government shutdown in history rolls into a fifth week, Mr. Jones finds himself holding the same position as Nancy Pelosi, the liberal House speaker: Reopen the government, then negotiate on border security.Mr. Jones is the only red-state Senate Democrat up for re-election in 2020. By taking on President Trump and the border wall, which are both popular in Alabama, and refusing to give ground on the shutdown, the senator may be the last \u201cDoug Jones Democrat\u201d to win here anytime soon.Alabama has one of the largest groups of federal workers in the country, and the economic pain of those who are out of work because of the shutdown is rippling through local businesses across the state.\u201cI voted for Jones, I did,\u201d said Ann Lynch, an 86-year-old retired schoolteacher, as she did her grocery shopping wrapped in a fur coat on a brisk afternoon in Huntsville, where more than half of the local economy is tied to federal spending. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t support the wall. I don\u2019t like that, of course. I think we need it. Trump knows we need it.\u201dMr. Jones\u2019s opposition also underscores the challenge Mr. Trump faces in fulfilling one of his key campaign promises, and the fierce partisanship that has come to define the stalled shutdown negotiations. If the president can\u2019t convince a Democrat from Alabama \u2014 the most vulnerable senator up for re-election in 2020 \u2014 to back his wall, who can he sway?\u201cI\u2019m just not going to throw money at anybody who is with a gun to my head,\u201d Mr. Jones said in an interview, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s $5.7 billion request for the wall. \u201cLet\u2019s get the government open.\u201dIn Huntsville, the impact of empty offices at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center on the Army\u2019s Redstone Arsenal base has rippled through the contractors, restaurants and hotels that power Rocket City. With 5,000 workers furloughed across the state, the pain is being felt by people like Angie Gates, whose small family restaurant lost out on $600 worth of lunch business recently because a prison training program was shut down during the wall standoff.ImageA rest stop outside of Huntsville, Ala., which is known as Rocket City because it is home to NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center.CreditWilliam DeShazer for The New York Times\u201cFor us, because we\u2019re a small town, the shutdown is kind of difficult. But there\u2019s also things in politics that may be worth doing,\u201d said Ms. Gates. \u201cIf Doug Jones doesn\u2019t support the wall, I don\u2019t support him.\u201dDemocrats argue that the politics of the shutdown favor their party, pointing to surveys showing that a majority of Americans blame the president for the stalemate and oppose the wall.But that political calculus may not hold for Mr. Jones, who won a special election to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was appointed attorney general. Polling also shows that support for the wall among conservatives, who make up much of Alabama\u2019s electorate, has remained strong during the shutdown. Even supporters of Mr. Jones think he\u2019s in trouble.\u201cHe\u2019s a dead man walking,\u201d said former Representative Parker Griffith, a conservative Democrat who helped Mr. Jones in his election and continues to support him. \u201cHe leaned into his base, and his base is not big enough to elect him.\u201dImageVolunteers sorted through food donations at the Food Bank of North Alabama, which is preparing to accommodate people affected by the government shutdown.CreditWilliam DeShazer for The New York TimesThe partisanship that has become a hallmark of the Trump era has not been kind to moderate Democrats: Of the five other Democrats from Trump-supporting red states who were in the Senate when Mr. Jones arrived last year, three lost their 2018 re-election bids after opposing Mr. Trump on various fronts, including the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.One who survived last year, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, has stood closer to Mr. Trump on the border wall than any other Democrat in the Senate, running an ad during his campaign touting his support for the proposal and saying he would back a presidential declaration of a state of emergency, if it would end the shutdown.Mr. Jones has adopted a different playbook. While he has voted with Mr. Trump half of the time, according to the website FiveThirtyEight, more than nearly any other Senate Democrat, he has stood with national Democrats on high-profile issues, including opposing Justice Kavanaugh. He used his first speech on the Senate floor to call for new gun control measures, tackling an issue that has long been anathema to many Southern Democrats.Democrats hope voters will value Mr. Jones\u2019s decision to stick with his gut when it comes to difficult political issues, even if that means siding with the national party.\u201cHe\u2019s a guy who\u2019s going to be true to himself,\u201d said John Anzalone, a Birmingham-based Democratic pollster. \u201cAuthenticity is what sells in a place like Alabama.\u201dBut there\u2019s also little question that Mr. Jones hit the political jackpot with his special election in 2017 by facing Roy S. Moore, an already-controversial Republican opponent who became all but radioactive after charges of sexual assault against underage girls. Even with that baggage, Mr. Jones beat Mr. Moore by only about 20,000 votes.A number of Republican officials in the state, including Representative Bradley Byrne and the Alabama State Senate president pro tempore, Del Marsh, are considering challenging Mr. Jones next year. None have the liabilities of Mr. Moore, who motivated a surge of black Democratic voters while prompting some Alabama Republicans to cross party lines and others to stay home from the polls.On top of those local challenges, Mr. Jones will also be running against the backdrop of the 2020 presidential election, a contest that will both highlight the national Democratic platform and bring out conservative voters eager to support the president.Even some of his supporters don\u2019t expect to be represented by Mr. Jones for much longer.\u201cSenator Jones, bless his heart, he\u2019ll be a one-term senator,\u201d said Sheila Pressnell, 61, as she walked through a Huntsville shopping center popular with employees of NASA and other government agencies. \u201cThe only reason he got it was because he was up against a child predator.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Jones said he is seeking bipartisan solutions to the shutdown, saying the debate \u201cis just nothing but political noise right now\u201d and blaming both parties for the stalemate.Republicans from his state have taken a starkly different approach.\u201cThe president is not going to blink, and he shouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Mr. Jones\u2019s Republican colleague in the Senate, adding that he would tell furloughed federal workers to \u201cget your Democrat friends to the table and negotiate with us.\u201dWhile shutdowns rarely determine the outcome of elections that come months or years later, the current political climate delivers a political double whammy to Mr. Jones\u2019s standing in the state, as some voters blame Congress, bitter that lawmakers are collecting paychecks as government workers struggle, and others want the border wall.Sandra Snell, a Transportation Security Administration agent at the Huntsville International Airport, said she doesn\u2019t believe anyone in Washington understands the economic struggles she now faces. Before the shutdown, she was preparing to sign a loan on a new house. Now, she\u2019s worried about paying her bills.ImageSandra Snell, a Transportation Security Administration agent at the Huntsville Municipal Airport, said she doesn\u2019t believe anyone in Washington understands the economic struggles she now faces.CreditWilliam DeShazer for The New York Times\u201cYou\u2019re a federal employee, I\u2019m a federal employee,\u201d Ms. Snell, 51, said she would like to tell members of Congress. \u201cI\u2019m having to go to work without pay. You\u2019re going to work with pay. I\u2019d like to see my check, too.\u201dIn Huntsville, local lenders and utilities are offering ways for furloughed workers to negotiate lower rates. Restaurants near the base say they have seen a nearly 50 percent drop in customers since the shutdown began. Churches offer counseling for furloughed workers. Food banks are stocking up on nonperishable, hearty fare like pasta, beans and tuna. And pawn shops are doing brisk business.Mr. Jones has been working with constituents to help them find services, and he has been an active presence on television and on the Senate floor pushing for a resolution. He has pushed to meet with Mr. Trump, saying the White House should come and brief members of Congress beyond just the party leadership.But for some in Alabama, the crisis offers another reminder to voters that Mr. Jones doesn\u2019t back the president \u2014 or his top campaign promise. Pam McGriff, the owner of a custom interior car detailing shop in Holly Pond, didn\u2019t vote in Mr. Jones\u2019s first election but said she would consider supporting him in 2020 if he supported Mr. Trump.\u201cIf he would go up there and balk the Democrats, like Schumer and Pelosi, and say, \u2018Hey, I think Trump is right,\u2019 and all that kind of stuff, I wouldn\u2019t mind splitting my ticket,\u201d said Ms. McGriff, 56, a Republican.Her husband, Wayne, disagreed, saying that sitting out Mr. Jones\u2019s election wasn\u2019t a choice he would be likely to repeat after watching the senator in office.\u201cHe should support what the people of Alabama want, which is the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be there, and next time he\u2019ll be voted out.\u201d"}, {"title": "When Affluent Families Dig Up Their Past", "category": "Business", "id": "00d0a3af-a4bd-47b7-9596-a98a5b3a0a2b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/your-money/wealthy-family-history.html", "publishdate": 20190118, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/19/business/19wealth/merlin_149358798_bdd73156-7e7e-4917-a56c-0d492bdf1413-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Just a few years out of college, Jeff Arnold sold his first company, which made a remote cardiac monitoring system, for $25 million. In 1999, he sold his second company, WebMD, becoming a billionaire before age 30.Now he\u2019s on his third company, Sharecare, a platform that helps people manage their own health care and allows companies to give employees incentives for better behavior. But while Mr. Arnold has an impressive entrepreneurial biography, what he lacked was an entrepreneurial history \u2014 more precisely, a history of his and his wife\u2019s families after they emigrated to America from Ireland, Germany and elsewhere in the mid-19th century.So, last summer, he sought one out.\u201cI don\u2019t feel my parents did a very good job of explaining my family history to me,\u201d Mr. Arnold said. \u201cI was the fifth of six children, so maybe they were tired. But I have four children, so explaining to them their roots was an important box I wanted to check.\u201dGenerationally wealthy families have long commissioned or participated in documenting family histories \u2014 think of the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds. At their most basic, these works preserve the stories of suffering and greatness that can remind younger generations of what came before them.But a new group of wealthy entrepreneurs and family business executives are using the past as action plans to guide change in themselves or their family. Wealth management firms are in on the action, with historians on staff. There are also independent historians ready to serve paying clients.\u201cWe go at least three generations back, to the great-grandparents\u2019 generation, so there are at least 16 different stories,\u201d said Andy Anderson, founder and chief historian of the Wells Fargo family and business history center. \u201cWe think of it as putting back together the jigsaw puzzle of family history that someone else dropped on the floor.\u201dWells Fargo offers this service free to clients of its Abbot Downing division, who have a minimum net worth of $100 million. Ascent Private Capital has a family historian who does similar research. And several other companies, like the Winthrop Group, an archival services consulting firm, produce family histories.Dr. Anderson, who has taught at Stanford and Ohio State University, said his group had done 500 family histories for wealthy clients.\u201cThe number-one thing we hear is, \u2018We\u2019d like our children and grandchildren to hear the stories about how hard it was to get to this level of wealth we\u2019re enjoying today,\u2019\u201d he said.Mr. Arnold wanted to use the family history to show where he had come from but also to learn about his family\u2019s health history.\u201cWhen I went through this process, I found so many males in my family who died at an early age,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pretty picture \u2014 70 was generous. It was more like in your 50s.\u201dMr. Arnold, who will turn 50 this year, said it was a good opportunity to speak with members of his family about taking care of themselves.Dr. Anderson said the benefits of a family health history went beyond what someone could learn through a genetic test.\u201cWhen you look at a death record for your own family and you see explicitly that very thing that is being predicted, or you see these really explicit documents that were filled out at the time, it gives you a greater sense of urgency,\u201d he said. \u201cThe predictive nature of this is important. You see evidence of Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia, and you understand the future long-term care costs.\u201dDebbie S. Brown, chairwoman of Laird Norton, a Seattle company in its seventh generation, used family history for a different action plan. It helped keep her family business together.The company, which began in 1855 as a Midwestern logging company, evolved into a real estate, wealth management and philanthropic enterprise. In 2003, its leaders announced that a series of investments had turned out badly. Worried about the business, some others in the family agitated to force that group out.In the midst of the turmoil, Ms. Brown said, she sought the advice of the company archivists and asked for examples of other bad investments.\u201cThere was nothing in the archives saying we had beat up or tossed out family members when investments went wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of our success was to reflect and learn from those moments and apply them to future investments.\u201dAfter the disgruntled relatives were able to put the losses in context \u2014 and calm down a bit \u2014 those running Laird Norton rethought how the company should work, Ms. Brown said. For starters, they established a family council that had real governance responsibility, and they looked outside the company for executives.In the way Mr. Arnold is using his family\u2019s medical histories to nudge his siblings to stay on top of their health, \u201cwe used our family history to help the family get comfortable with the decisions we were making,\u201d Ms. Brown said.Learning these histories is not without challenges. After all, no family is perfect, and honesty can be complicated. Historians generally suggest two approaches to tell a truthful story without causing family strife.A safe option is to create a series of biographical profiles of key family members. Rochelle Clarke, founder and chief executive of the consulting firm Succession Strength, said this was often a way to avoid arguments over points no one is going to agree on anyway.\u201cWhat\u2019s important is the story is documented and it\u2019s told,\u201d she said. \u201cThere may be deviation on one event or another, but the memories aren\u2019t being thrown out completely. It\u2019s an agree-to-disagree approach.\u201dAnother is to create a portrait of how the family truly was, with its triumphs and imperfections on full display. Janice DiPietro, chief executive and founder of Exceptional Leaders International, said complete histories could create a shared family language.In one family Ms. DiPietro worked with, the founder had given sons and daughters unequal shares of the business, which led to a discussion on how to equalize the distribution going forward.Either way, Frazer Rice, the author of \u201cWealth, Actually\u201d and a consultant on wealth management and governance, said a family should not rush to act on what it had learned from its history.\u201cCaution should be used before pulling out the big guns,\u201d he said. \u201cCentering an advice project around the family history shouldn\u2019t be done until a general sense of the impact is known.\u201dMr. Arnold said that when his family history was unveiled, filling an oversize boardroom table with about 200 documents, he felt self-conscious.\u201cIt was a little uncomfortable in the beginning, because I was hearing it for the first time and my kids were there,\u201d he said, comparing it to doing due diligence on a company. Noting he came from humble roots, he added, \u201cI thought it was a little bit uncomfortable because I don\u2019t have those generational perfect portraits in my family.\u201dBut as about 20 relatives, including his mother, in-laws and children, ranging in age from 12 to 20, walked around the table, he started to feel better. Mr. Arnold, who had lived with his wife on Peachtree Battle Road in Atlanta, was interested to learn that a relative had fought in the Battle of Peachtree Creek in the Civil War.\u201cIt\u2019s about self-awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cTo piece it together and to tell a story \u2014 it made you proud of how you\u2019ve gotten here.\u201d"}, {"title": "In California, Gender Can No Longer Be Considered in Setting Car Insurance Rates", "category": "Business", "id": "e51b8869-a787-4550-a086-509cad95f4c5", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/your-money/car-insurance-gender-california.html", "publishdate": 20190118, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/19/business/19Adviser-illo/merlin_149347014_55553174-876c-47fb-bda6-12e1cd22b9f0-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "California joined about a half-dozen states this month in banning the use of a person\u2019s gender when assessing risk factors for car insurance, a change that could potentially alter rates for scores of drivers across the state.The state, which is the country\u2019s most populous, requires insurers to prioritize criteria like drivers\u2019 safety records and years of experience behind the wheel when setting auto rates, but it also allows them to weigh other factors, like marital status. Gender had been among the optional criteria until the beginning of this year, when a new regulation went into effect prohibiting the practice.In announcing the change, the departing state insurance commissioner, Dave Jones, said the new regulations \u201censure that auto insurance rates are based on factors within a driver\u2019s control, rather than personal characteristics over which drivers have no control.\u201dMr. Jones\u2019s term as commissioner ended in early January, and the new regulation was one of his final acts. The state\u2019s Insurance Department, in explaining its reasoning for the change, noted that the industry had inconsistently \u2014 and perhaps unfairly \u2014 applied gender weighting in pricing.Some insurers found that female drivers were a higher risk while others claimed the inverse, the department concluded, and the factoring of gender on rates varied widely by location.\u201cGender\u2019s relationship to risk of loss no longer appears to be substantial,\u201d the department noted, saying the rationale for using it was \u201csuspect.\u201d\u201cCharging drivers different rates by their gender might have seemed like a good idea decades ago,\u201d Ricardo Lara, the new state insurance commissioner, said in an emailed statement. \u201cGender, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation are beyond your control, and it is not a fair or even an effective way to predict risk.\u201dThe specific impact on someone\u2019s insurance rates in California remains uncertain. Insurers have until at least July to submit gender-neutral auto rating plans to the Insurance Department for review.Removing the gender factor could in effect equalize rates for inexperienced drivers: Younger men, who have typically paid higher rates, on average might see declines, while younger women could see increases. In an economic analysis of the change, the Insurance Department estimated that female drivers with three or fewer years of driving experience were expected to see the biggest impact, with rates going up 6 percent on average. Male drivers with similar driving experience could have a corresponding decrease of about 5 percent.The department\u2019s analysis, based on 17 companies that make up about two-thirds of the state\u2019s consumer car insurance market, estimated scant effect on rates over all.The impact for any given driver, however, could \u201cvary considerably\u201d by the individual, by the insurer and by the type of coverage chosen, the state noted.Janet Ruiz, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, said she didn\u2019t expect California drivers over all to see a big impact on premiums, because gender wasn\u2019t one of the top factors used in setting rates anyway.Other states that ban the use of gender in setting rates include Hawaii, Massachusetts, Montana, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, according to the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit advocacy group. Most other states allow the practice, and insurers have long argued that the use of gender in setting premiums is sound actuarial practice.Alyssa Connolly, director of marketing insights at the Zebra, a website that provides auto insurance quotes, suggested that gender as a rating factor tended to have \u201cminimal impact\u201d on rates across the United States. On a national level, the premium difference is about 1 percent, she said, with men having paid slightly more through 2016 and women paying more since then. Nevada, Utah and Minnesota have the greatest disparity in rates by gender, with premiums varying by 4 to 6 percent.Douglas Heller, an insurance expert and consultant, submitted testimony to the Insurance Department in support of the change, on behalf of the Consumer Federation of California\u2019s Education Foundation, a consumer rights group. Research he conducted with the Consumer Federation of America found that despite widespread belief to the contrary, women \u2014 particularly those over 25 \u2014 may often pay \u201csignificantly\u201d higher rates than men with similar driving records.\u201cBy using gender as a rating factor,\u201d Mr. Heller said in his testimony, \u201cinsurers diminish the impact of more appropriate rating factors, such as driver safety, miles driven and driving experience.\u201dOther groups, including Texas Appleseed, a nonprofit advocacy group, have also found that women are often unfairly charged higher rates.The rule change in California followed the advent of a state law aimed at accommodating the concerns of transgender people when using identity documents. The Gender Recognition Act of 2017 in part allows Californians to choose, in addition to \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale,\u201d a third category of \u201cnonbinary\u201d on their state driver\u2019s licenses. The law describes nonbinary as an umbrella term for people whose gender identities \u201cfall somewhere outside of the traditional conceptions of strictly either female or male.\u201d The option became available Jan. 1.In Oregon, where drivers may select \u201cnot specified\u201d as a third gender category on their licenses, insurers may continue to use gender as a factor in setting rates. However, insurers must submit documentation justifying how they rate those drivers.Here are some questions and answers about auto insurance premiums:What factors do insurers consider when setting auto insurance rates?The rules vary by state, and some exclude or restrict certain criteria. Typical factors used by insurers to assess a driver\u2019s risk and set premiums, in addition to your driving record and claims history, might include where you live, your age, education, occupation, marital status, credit history and the type of car you drive, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.What can I do if I think my auto premium is too high?Industry representatives and consumer advocates alike advise people to seek quotes periodically from competing insurers. Ms. Connolly of the Zebra suggests getting quotes for comparison every six to 12 months. \u201cRates change all the time,\u201d she said.What else can I do to keep my auto rates affordable?Consider raising your deductible, the amount subtracted from your check when an insurer pays a claim under your policy. Going from $500 to $1,000 can save between 10 and 15 percent annually on premiums, Ms. Connolly said. Also, make sure you don\u2019t let your policy lapse; if you go without coverage even for a day, you\u2019ll likely see your rates rise. And, she said, bundling your coverage for renter\u2019s or homeowner\u2019s insurance with your auto policy with the same insurer can save an average of 8 percent annually."}, {"title": "Jesse Angelo Is Out as Publisher of The New York Post", "category": "Business", "id": "bfb41ad0-bbe4-44e5-9155-f0031cb82693", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/business/media/new-york-post-publisher-jesse-angelo.html", "publishdate": 20190118, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/18/business/18nypost-print/18nypost-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Rupert Murdoch\u2019s New York tabloid has a new boss.In an announcement on Thursday, News Corporation, the newspaper\u2019s parent company, said that Jesse Angelo was out as publisher and chief executive after two decades at the paper.

It fell in love with the way its utopian ideas could be pursued in America,\u201d Seth Lipsky, a former editor in chief of The Forward, said in an email.At its height in the 1920s, the publication had a circulation of more than 250,000, with editions printed around the country. \u201cIt was huge,\u201d said Mr. Lipsky, who wrote \u201cThe Rise of Abraham Cahan\u201d and founded The New York Sun, a New York City daily broadsheet that lasted from 2002 to 2008.Mr. Lipsky said he was not worried about The Forward leaving print for something less palpable. \u201cAll of us in one way or another are approaching this rendezvous,\u201d he said.These days, he added, the manner of publication is not the main thing: \u201cI think the future of the paper will be secured by scoops, rather than the method of delivery.\u201dAt a time when print advertising has decreased and newsstands sell more candy bars and lottery tickets than newspapers, The Forward is not alone in making the shift to a digital-only format.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Greetings, I\u2019m Natasha Singer, your resident privacy reporter. And I\u2019m writing to you from wintry New York City as the government shutdown increases financial pressure on federal workers and the tech elites jet off to Davos, Switzerland, to hobnob at the World Economic Forum.For the last few years, the forum has been heralding the \u201cFourth Industrial Revolution.\u201d That\u2019s the idea that today\u2019s digital innovations are generating entire new industries \u2014 in much the way electricity enabled the mass production of the Model T Ford in the early 20th century.But a provocative new book, \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\u201d by Shoshana Zuboff, a professor emerita at the Harvard Business School, offers a more sobering counternarrative.Published on Tuesday, the book argues that digital services developed by the likes of Google and Facebook should not be viewed as the latest iteration of industrialization. Instead, Dr. Zuboff writes, they represent a new and problematic market form that trades in predicting and influencing human behavior.\u201cSurveillance capitalism has taken human experience, specifically private human experience, and unilaterally claimed it as something to be bought and sold in the marketplace,\u201d Dr. Zuboff told me during a visit to The Times\u2019s office. \u201cThis new kind of marketplace trades in behavioral futures. It\u2019s like a form of derivative. But it\u2019s about us.\u201dYet most of us are not aware that platforms like Google and Facebook may track and analyze our every search, location, like, video, photo, post and punctuation mark the better to try to sway us, she said.In fact, a new study on Facebook from the Pew Research Center illustrates how opaque this behavior marketplace can be to consumers.The study, my colleague Sapna Maheswari writes, reported that about three-fourths of Facebook users were unaware that the social network maintained lists of their personal interests, such as their political leanings, for advertisers. And about half of users who looked at their \u201cad preferences\u201d \u2014 the Facebook pages displaying these details \u2014 said they were uncomfortable with the company\u2019s creating lists of categories about them.The technologies that power the behavior speculation market, of course, have spread far beyond online ads.They enable auto insurers to surveil drivers and offer discounts based on their driving performance. They allow workplace wellness programs to charge higher health insurance premiums to employees who decline to wear fitness trackers. They helped Kremlin-linked groups mount political influence campaigns on Facebook (although, as my colleague John Herrman pointed out this past week, we have yet to learn how effective those campaigns were).The flash-trading in human behavioral data was not inevitable.In her book, Dr. Zuboff describes how Google, in its early days, used the keywords that people typed in to improve its search engine even as it paid scant attention to the collateral data \u2014 like users\u2019 keyword phrasing, click patterns and spellings \u2014 that came with it. Pretty soon, however, Google began harvesting this surplus information, along with other details like users\u2019 web-browsing activities, to infer their interests and target them with ads.The model was later adopted by Facebook.The companies\u2019 pivot \u2014 from serving to surveilling their users \u2014 pushed Google and Facebook to harvest more and more data, Dr. Zuboff writes. In doing so, the companies sometimes bypassed privacy settings or made it difficult for users to opt out of data-sharing.\u201cWe saw these digital services were free, and we thought, you know, \u2018We\u2019re making a reasonable trade-off with giving them valuable data,\u2019\u201d Dr. Zuboff told me. \u201cBut now that\u2019s reversed. They\u2019ve decided that we\u2019re free, that they can take our experience for free and translate it into behavioral data. And so we are just the source of raw material.\u201dOf course, tech companies tend to bristle at the word \u201csurveillance.\u201d They associate it with government spying on individuals \u2014 not with their own snooping on users and trying to sway them at scale.\u201cWhen organizations do surveillance, people don\u2019t have control over that,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief, said in April during a Senate hearing on Cambridge Analytica, the voter-profiling company that improperly harvested the data of millions of Facebook users. \u201cBut on Facebook, everything that you share, you have control over.\u201dSurveillance, however, simply means observation or supervision, often with the intent of channeling the surveilled in a particular direction. As Dr. Zuboff\u2019s book points out, that is at the core of Facebook\u2019s panopticon of a business model.In other news:\u25a0 Microsoft pledged nearly $500 million in loans to help build affordable housing in the Seattle area. The money is \u201cthe most ambitious effort by a tech company to directly address the inequality that has spread\u201d in its backyard, Karen Weise writes.\u25a0 Facebook is facing continued pressure to more aggressively counter the spread of divisive disinformation and user manipulation on its platform, Adam Satariano writes. The company said Thursday that it had identified two new Russian-linked misinformation campaigns. \u201cUp to 1,200 people expressed interest in attending one of the roughly 190 events organized by those behind the fake pages,\u201d the article notes. \u201cFacebook couldn\u2019t say whether any of the events had taken place.\u201d\u25a0 Legislators must find a new way to regulate social media, Natasha Tusikov, a criminology professor, and Blayne Haggart, a political-science professor, argue in The Conversation. One suggestion, they write: \u201cIt\u2019s time to consider noncommercial ownership of social-media entities \u2014 including nonprofit or some form of public ownership.\u201d\u25a0 And finally, how might countries grapple with a global labor market in which there are few protections for many digital workers?

Mr. Musk said in a companywide email that he wanted the lowest-priced Model 3 to sell for $35,000.To do so, Mr. Musk said in the email, Tesla must improve the car\u2019s design, increase production and shed thousands of workers. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any other way,\u201d he wrote.Tesla shares closed down 13 percent after the announcement.The cuts, which could put more than 3,000 people out of work, follow a 9 percent reduction in Tesla\u2019s staff in June. Another of Mr. Musk\u2019s companies, the privately held rocket maker SpaceX, said this month that it would shrink its work force by about 10 percent.Given the continuing uncertainty in global financial markets and signs that consumers are spending less, trimming costs to focus on affordability is \u201ca prudent thing to do\u201d for a company that started out selling cars with an average price close to $100,000, said Romit Shah, a research analyst at Nomura Instinet.In October, Tesla reported that the third quarter of 2018 had yielded its first quarterly profit in two years, and its largest ever, thanks to cost-cutting moves, delayed payments to suppliers and a surge in production and sales.Mr. Musk said in his email on Friday that, based on preliminary, unaudited results, the company expected to earn a smaller profit in the fourth quarter.\u201cThis quarter will hopefully allow us, with great difficulty, effort and some luck, to target a tiny profit,\u201d he wrote in his email on Friday.In the third quarter, Mr. Shah said, Tesla \u201cneeded to get to profitability to survive, and they wouldn\u2019t have gotten there if they were selling a $35,000 car.\u201d\u201cThey would have lost money on every car they sold,\u201d he added, echoing a sentiment expressed by Mr. Musk last spring.To meet its production and profit targets, Tesla focused on selling more upscale models of the Model 3 to a core group of Tesla enthusiasts willing to pay the higher prices.\u201cBut there\u2019s only a finite number of potential customers willing spend over $50,000 on a Model 3,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cIf Tesla wants to see a pathway to a million cars sold a year, they\u2019re going to have to bring down that price point.\u201dTo succeed, the company will need to extend its appeal to a wider audience. Mr. Musk said Friday that Tesla must begin to deliver its midrange Model 3 in all markets by around May while making progress toward producing the $35,000 version he envisions.\u201cHead count reduction is part of the process,\u201d Philippe Houchois, an analyst at Jefferies, said in a note to clients.Tesla has already lowered prices for all of its vehicles this month by $2,000 as a federal tax credit for buyers of electric cars that was worth $7,500 last year begins to be phased out.\u201cWhile we have made great progress, our products are still too expensive for most people,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote. Last year \u201cwas the most challenging in Tesla\u2019s history,\u201d he added, and \u201cthe road ahead is very difficult.\u201dMr. Musk traveled to Shanghai this month to break ground for Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory assembly plant. It is expected to be producing Model 3s by the end of the year.Having a base in China, which imposes a 15 percent tariff on imported cars, will give Tesla an advantage over automakers that produce vehicles outside the country. But economic activity is slowing in China, and many consumers there are cutting back on spending.The car market in the United States is also showing signs of strain, with sales flattening last year.Tesla is also contending with a challenge from traditional automakers like Ford, General Motors and Nissan, which are pushing harder into the electric-vehicle market. Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz and others have also introduced or plan to produce electric models that in many cases are less expensive than Tesla\u2019s.As Tesla struggled last year to cope with a Model 3 production and delivery process that Mr. Musk has described as \u201chell,\u201d his behavior created distractions for the company.In August, he wrote in a short, cryptic post on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private and had \u201cfunding secured,\u201d surprising board members and driving up the stock price.The Securities and Exchange Commission later sued Mr. Musk in federal court, saying he had misled investors. He settled with the agency, agreeing to pay a $20 million fine and to step aside as chairman for three years."}, {"title": "Mitsubishi Accuses Carlos Ghosn of Taking a Secret $9 Million Payment", "category": "Business", "id": "ee35741d-7bcf-4bdf-97fb-06061adfac09", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/business/carlos-ghosn-mitsubishi.html", "publishdate": 20190118, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/19/business/19ghosn2/merlin_148897515_33704261-5a17-4e86-8def-9203572b4c75-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "TOKYO \u2014 Mitsubishi Motors has joined Nissan in accusing Carlos Ghosn of financial wrongdoing, saying on Friday that he secretly received compensation of 7.8 million euros, or almost $9 million, from a joint venture of the two automakers.Osamu Masuko, Mitsubishi\u2019s chief executive, told reporters in Tokyo that the automaker was considering suing Mr. Ghosn, the former chairman of both Nissan and Mitsubishi. Renault, the third automaker in the global car alliance that Mr. Ghosn ran, is also  preparing to cut ties with its star executive.Mr. Ghosn has been detained in Tokyo since Nov. 19 on suspicion of understating his salary for eight years, and of temporarily transferring personal investment losses to Nissan\u2019s books during the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Ghosn has denied all charges. His lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.Mitsubishi\u2019s findings involve a joint venture between Nissan and Mitsubishi established in 2017 in the Netherlands. The company said Mr. Ghosn, who is listed as a director of the joint venture, had drawn up an employment contract that rewarded him \u20ac7.8 million in compensation.The joint venture had been set up to distribute part of the savings generated by Nissan\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Mitsubishi to the departments at the automakers that generated the savings, a kind of incentive scheme to bring the companies closer together.The joint venture\u2019s other directors \u2014 Mr. Masuko and Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa \u2014 were unpaid and kept in the dark about Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation, according to Mitsubishi. The company learned about the payment only after Nissan shared the findings of its internal investigation into Mr. Ghosn, it said.ImageOsamu Masuko, Mitsubishi\u2019s chief executive, left, said that the automaker was considering suing Mr. Ghosn, its former chairman.CreditEugene Hoshiko/Associated Press\u201cNobody, including myself, was informed,\u201d Mr. Masuko said.It is unclear whether Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation broke any laws. The joint venture was an unincorporated subsidiary of Mitsubishi and Nissan registered in the Netherlands, meaning it is likely to be beyond the purview of Japanese financial regulators.Mitsubishi\u2019s allegations are the latest twist in a fall from grace for Mr. Ghosn, an industry titan. Nissan and Mitsubishi have already removed Mr. Ghosn from his posts as chairman at the two companies, though he remains on their boards.Nissan owns a controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors, while Renault is Nissan\u2019s biggest shareholder.Renault had stood by Mr. Ghosn, keeping him as chairman and chief executive even as he sat in a Tokyo jail. But after a Tokyo court rejected his bail request Tuesday, the French government called for new leadership at the automaker. Its board is expected to meet in the coming days to consider cutting ties with him.Two French officials, including the government\u2019s representative on the Renault board, were in Tokyo for meetings this week, though Nissan has declined to comment on any discussions.Naming a successor to Mr. Ghosn would not necessarily mean Renault considered him guilty of wrongdoing. It could instead reflect a realistic assessment of the executive\u2019s inability to perform his duties from jail, where he has limited contact with the outside world.Mitsubishi, meanwhile, will \u201cpush forward with its investigation,\u201d Mr. Masuko said."}, {"title": "Trump Administration Spells Out Who Wins and Loses From New Tax Break", "category": "Business", "id": "a8248c70-a3e8-4d46-9f33-c261e6969e57", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/business/trump-administration-business-tax-break.html", "publishdate": 20190118, "imageurl": "", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Shrugging off the limitations of the partial government shutdown, the Trump administration finalized rules on Friday governing who can claim a new 20 percent tax deduction for business owners.Officials said the rules would allow millions of businesses to file their 2018 taxes with certainty over whether they qualify for the break.The deduction for so-called pass-through businesses was a central feature of the sweeping tax-cut legislation that President Trump signed at the end of 2017. The vast majority of American small businesses are organized as pass-throughs, whose profits are divided up among owners and taxed as individual income. Many financial firms and real estate companies \u2014 including hundreds that are under the umbrella of the Trump Organization \u2014 are also set up as pass-throughs.The regulation includes several changes from a proposal the Treasury Department issued in August. It now allows certain mutual-fund holders to benefit from the deduction if they have holdings in a real estate trust. It also provides far greater detail on the type of service businesses that are excluded from claiming the deduction above a certain income threshold. The law\u2019s drafters have said that limitation was meant to prevent certain high-earning individuals, such as lawyers, from reclassifying individual income as pass-through income, in order to reduce their tax bills.Some of those details appear likely to disappoint business leaders who urged Treasury to broaden the definition of what sorts of companies qualify for the full deduction. Major League Baseball owners, for example, had pushed to be eligible after the draft regulations excluded them.\u201cSports clubs are engaged in a multifaceted business that involves activities and operations relating to selling media rights, tickets, concessions, signage rights, sponsorships, merchandise and other goods, managing real estate, and creating entertainment content,\u201d the M.L.B. commissioner, Robert D. Manfred Jr., wrote in a comment on the proposed regulations. \u201cThis is in stark contrast to accounting firms, law firms, consulting firms, investment banking firms, and health care practices, whose sole and narrow business is to engage in the performance of professional services for their customers.\u201dThe final regulations still exclude them.The nation\u2019s largest small-business advocacy group, the National Federation of Independent Business, welcomed the regulation. It provides \u201cneeded certainty to small business owners,\u201d said Brad Close, senior vice president of public policy and advocacy. \u201cThe vast majority of small businesses will enjoy the benefits of the full 20 percent deduction.\u201dA companion regulation issued on Friday would allow owners of rental properties to claim the deduction provided they keep certain records and perform 250 hours a year of \u201crental services\u201d on the property \u2014 either by themselves or by hiring someone to do it. Those guidelines would appear to allow some Americans who rent rooms or other property through sites such as Airbnb to qualify for the full deduction, though not if they live in the property at any time during the year.The guidelines also exclude some of the largest landlords in the country, because they rent to tenants using so-called triple-net leases that call for tenants to pay all real estate taxes, maintenance and building insurance. \u201cI am very surprised they did what they did,\u201d said Anthony J. Nitti, a tax partner at Withum in Aspen, Colo., who has written extensively on pass-through regulations. \u201cIt creates this strange dichotomy.\u201dMr. Nitti said winners under the new regulations include assisted living facilities and employment staffing companies, which appear now to qualify for the full deduction without limitations. Losers include radiologists and possibly chiropractors, who appear not to qualify, he said.Nicole Kaeding, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation in Washington, said the regulations would likely lead to lawsuits that force courts to determine whether many individual businesses qualify.\u201cIt is a generous deduction that encourages individuals to try and take advantage,\u201d she said. \u201cThe I.R.S. regulations could be perfect and still, the beneficial tax treatment will ensure that accountants and attorneys will seek to be innovative on new business structures and forms to maximize the deduction.\u201dTreasury is one of the agencies where funding has lapsed during the government shutdown, meaning its employees are either furloughed or working without pay. The department has recalled tens of thousands of workers to process tax refunds and aid taxpayers during tax filing season, which is scheduled to open at month\u2019s end.On Friday, officials told reporters that the shutdown had delayed release of the final pass-through regulations by one or two weeks. Other regulations governing provisions of the Trump tax cuts remain under development by the department. Officials said they have identified \u201chigh priority\u201d regulations and focused resources in order to complete them in time for filing season."}, {"title": "On Politics: The Biggest Stories of the Week", "category": "Politics", "id": "213d29a4-0342-4f14-b2ea-975a1696b744", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/us/politics/on-politics-the-biggest-stories-of-the-week.html", "publishdate": 20190119, "imageurl": "", "content": "From the shutdown that won\u2019t end to the latest revelation about the president and Russia, it\u2019s been a busy week in American politics.

It\u2019s also beginning to affect federal court funding and criminal justice reform.But as the effects spread, Washington is still at a stalemate. President Trump rejected a proposal from the Republican senator Lindsey Graham on Monday to temporarily reopen the government in an effort to jump-start negotiations with Democrats. Democrats, in turn, rejected an invite from Mr. Trump on Tuesday to discuss the shutdown over lunch at the White House.The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, asked Mr. Trump on Wednesday to scrap or delay his State of the Union address, citing security and logistical concerns stemming from the shutdown. Mr. Trump retaliated on Thursday by grounding the military plane that was going to take the speaker and other lawmakers to Afghanistan, a trip he called a \u201cpublic relations event.\u201d Ms. Pelosi ultimately postponed her plans, saying that Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement \u201chad significantly increased the danger\u201d of the trip.Lawmakers are beginning to float the idea that perhaps federal workers shouldn\u2019t show up to work at all; House Democrats are contemplating a homeland security spending measure with their own ideas for securing the border; and Mr. Trump is growing increasingly anxious.Additional Reading\u2022 Shutdown\u2019s Economic Damage Starts to Pile Up, Threatening an End to Growth\u2022 Republicans Are in Lock Step With Trump on Shutdown.

(He later said that he wasn\u2019t.) This week, it emerged that Mr. Trump has repeatedly withheld details of his conversations with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, from his own aides, even taking notes from an interpreter who attended one of their meetings.Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has insisted that there was \u201cno collusion\u201d with Russia during his 2016 campaign. But on each of the five times he has met with Mr. Putin since taking office, he has fueled suspicions about their relationship.Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s lawyer, backtracked on Thursday from earlier remarks in which he seemed to leave open the possibility that Trump campaign aides had coordinated with Russia in its election interference.After Mr. Trump made cryptic comments about his former attorney Michael Cohen, top Democrats in Congress warned Sunday that any effort to discourage or influence a witness\u2019s testimony could be construed as a crime. On Friday, BuzzFeed News reported that Mr. Trump had directed Mr. Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow.

The punishment came after Mr. King, who has a long history of racist remarks, made comments to The Times last week questioning why white supremacy was considered offensive.On Tuesday, Republicans began pushing Mr. King toward the exit and created a super PAC aimed at unseating him in 2020. The House also voted nearly unanimously to endorse a resolution that rejected white nationalism and white supremacy as \u201chateful expressions of intolerance that are contradictory to the values that define the people of the United States.\u201dMany Iowa voters still like Mr. King, our reporter found, despite his open defense of white supremacy.

They do not always approve staff recommendations.The highest financial penalty imposed on a tech company was Google\u2019s $22 million settlement in 2012 for privacy violations. In the December meeting, the commissioners discussed a higher fine for Facebook, the people said.The Federal Trade Commission declined to comment. Facebook, which has repeatedly defended its actions, also declined to comment.The Washington Post earlier reported about the meeting and the potential for a record fine.The investigation is seen as a litmus test of the government\u2019s ability to protect consumers in the digital age. All five commissioners have testified to Congress that they need more resources to go up against big corporations in enforcement actions. Their agency does not have the authority to create privacy rules, but it can police businesses through a broad mandate to protect consumers from deceptive and unfair practices.The investigation into Facebook began with revelations by The New York Times that a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had obtained data from tens of millions of Facebook users without permission. The report ignited calls for investigations by global regulators and the summoning of Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify before Congress last April.A consent decree from 2011 requires Facebook to seek permission from users of plans to share their data with third parties. The trade commission also requires Facebook to notify it when third parties misuse user data.Over the past nine months, enforcement and consumer-protection officials have looked into a series of additional reports by The Times and other publications that raised questions about whether Facebook\u2019s use of data violated its consent decree, according to former officials. The expanded investigation included Facebook\u2019s partnerships with hardware and other tech giants like Netflix and Amazon that gave other companies access to Facebook user data without explicit permission.Facebook has said Cambridge Analytica told it that the firm had deleted the data. The social network has hired scores of lawyers and privacy experts to handle the commission\u2019s investigation, and Facebook\u2019s top privacy officials and lawyers are in regular conversation with officials leading the investigation.For 17 months of the Trump administration, the Federal Trade Commission was run by two commissioners. In May, the new slate of commissioners arrived, all appointed by President Trump. Three members are typically from the president\u2019s party, and two from the other party.The agency\u2019s chairman, Joseph J. Simons, an antitrust lawyer, has declined to comment about the investigation. He has sent strict orders throughout the agency against leaking information about the inquiry to reporters.One of the people familiar with the investigation said the meeting last month, though unusual, had been called partly because three of the commissioners were new, and because the case warranted an update from enforcement and consumer-protection staff.The people said the investigation had been slowed by the government shutdown, now in its fifth week. The hallways at the agency are empty, and just the five commissioners and a smattering of other employees have arrived for work during the shutdown."}, {"title": "As Beto O\u2019Rourke Weighs 2020 Run, Democrats Chafe at His Go-It-Alone Style", "category": "Politics", "id": "a4b60dc4-c8b4-4444-bac5-6a96f35a44e8", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/us/politics/beto-orourke-democrats-president.html", "publishdate": 20190119, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/15/us/politics/15beto1-print/merlin_146335875_4c558890-43b2-46e4-a258-36535cd8ca84-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "For a moment in August, an event hall in Texas teemed with hope, taquitos and unity.It was a border-town stop for Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate campaign, but another Democratic politician commanded particular attention: Gina Ortiz Jones, a history-making congressional candidate \u2014 gay, Filipina-American, an Iraq war veteran \u2014 hoping to turn a majority-Hispanic district blue. \u201cReally special person,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, as Ms. Jones stood and waved.But soon, a county chairwoman posed an uncomfortable question. Mr. O\u2019Rourke had not endorsed Ms. Jones. In fact, he had elevated her Republican opponent, Representative Will Hurd, with frequent praise and, most memorably, a live-streamed bipartisan road trip that helped jump-start their midterm campaigns. Would Mr. O\u2019Rourke support the Democrat?He would not.\u201cThis is a place where my politics and my job and my commitment to this country come into conflict,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cI\u2019m going to put country over party.\u201dSome supporters of Ms. Jones saw it differently: Beto O\u2019Rourke was once again putting Beto O\u2019Rourke first.Five months later, as Mr. O\u2019Rourke considers a run for president, his decision not to back Ms. Jones lays bare the go-it-alone streak that has defined his career, separating him from a modern Democratic Party that has prized near-uniform opposition to Republicans in Washington. While supporters view his above-the-fray message as the foundation of his appeal, he has left important Democratic constituencies wondering if he can be fully trusted as an ally.\u201cBeto-first politics,\u201d said Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic operative who worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cHe was concerned about Beto. I\u2019m not sure he was concerned about building the future of Democratic politics.\u201dIn Texas\u2019 23rd Congressional District, his choice was more than symbolic. Mr. Hurd won by fewer than 1,000 votes, and many voters and local activists hold Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u2014 whose success helped lift down-ballot candidates across the state \u2014 largely responsible for Ms. Jones\u2019s defeat.\u201cAll I kept thinking was, wait, Beto is supposed to be helping us because he\u2019s a Democrat,\u201d said Rosey R. Abuabara, the leader of TX-23 Indivisible, which worked to oust Mr. Hurd. \u201cI really felt like Beto was just getting in my way.\u201dMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s aides noted that his campaign \u2014 and its sprawling grass-roots operation \u2014 had been enormously helpful to the party\u2019s cause, sharing voter information with fellow Democrats, opening hundreds of campaign offices and inviting other candidates to speak at his well-attended events.ImageGina Ortiz Jones, a gay, Filipina-American Iraq war veteran, lost her congressional race in Texas\u2019s 23rd District by just over 900 votes.CreditLisa Krantz/The San Antonio Express-News, via Associated Press\u201cBeto fully invested in building the future of Democratic politics across Texas,\u201d his spokesman, Chris Evans, said in an email, adding that the campaign\u2019s efforts would serve as a foundation \u201cfor all future Democratic campaigns in the state.\u201dYet even some admirers of Mr. O\u2019Rourke have struggled to reconcile the snub of Ms. Jones, particularly in a year when female and nonwhite candidates like her helped lift Democrats to a House majority. Though Mr. O\u2019Rourke stayed neutral, Ms. Jones drew high-wattage help in the race, including from prominent Texas Democrats like Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary who is running for president, and Wendy Davis, the former candidate for governor and abortion-rights activist.Asked whether Mr. O\u2019Rourke had a special responsibility to support a female candidate of color in this Democratic moment, Ms. Davis sounded almost anguished.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say,\u201d she said, adding that she did not mean to \u201cback-seat drive\u201d a friend\u2019s decision-making. \u201cI would feel that special duty. I personally would feel that. Beto\u2019s not me, and I\u2019m not Beto.\u201dMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s very presence as a would-be presidential contender for 2020 is an issue of heated debate within the party. He is a prolific fund-raiser who proved he can energize younger voters, and some early polls place him third behind Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders, well ahead of many more decorated politicians. But he is also a relatively inexperienced lawmaker who lost his Senate race against Ted Cruz.For close watchers of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rise, his approach to Ms. Jones\u2019s contest captured the twin pillars of his political worldview: He has an instinct for performative campaigning, reaching for multiplatform connection to voters but often lurching toward extreme oversharing. (Mr. O\u2019Rourke was widely mocked recently after turning the camera on his own dental appointment.)And he has often defied the wishes of his fellow Democrats, especially traditional party leaders, who have eyed him warily since he challenged a Democratic incumbent in 2012 to reach Congress in the first place.Through a fluke of weather, timing and internet trendsetting, Mr. Hurd sits at the intersection of it all. Until March 2017, he and Mr. O\u2019Rourke had been friendly enough as district neighbors, but never especially close. Then, after a snowstorm grounded their flights from Texas to Washington, Mr. O\u2019Rourke suggested they drive instead \u2014 and record themselves for all 1,600 miles, answering questions from followers along the way.Alone in their rented Chevy Impala, they sang along to Willie Nelson, hashed out health care and trade policy and made a late-night doughnut run in Tennessee, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers and wide-scale media coverage. Newt Gingrich called in to salute them. Mark Zuckerberg chimed in approvingly on Facebook.ImageIn early 2017, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and Representative Will Hurd, a Republican, live-streamed a road trip from Texas to Washington.\u201cOur party leadership is probably not super excited that we\u2019re doing this,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said at one point.He was half right. Democrats in Washington, who had eyed Mr. Hurd\u2019s seat as a prime pickup opportunity after Mrs. Clinton carried the district in 2016, winced at the sight of Mr. O\u2019Rourke bolstering Mr. Hurd\u2019s reputation for bipartisanship. Republicans were delighted to have a high-profile showcase for Mr. Hurd\u2019s personality and moderate image.His congenial political brand helped him establish a consistent lead over Ms. Jones in private polling, giving pause to some national groups, like the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, about investing in the race.\u201cIt was a huge boost for us,\u201d Matt Gorman, the communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee during the midterms, said of the road trip. \u201cThat thing went totally viral.\u201dMark McKinnon, a veteran of Texas politics who was an adviser to George W. Bush, said by email that the road trip became a \u201clife preserver for Hurd and launchpad for Beto.\u201dMr. O\u2019Rourke and his team seemed to recognize this. The ride registered as his campaign\u2019s unofficial kickoff. And he was quick to invoke his relationship with Mr. Hurd, to deflect attacks from Mr. Cruz that he was too far left for Texas, and to burnish his self-styled standing as a high-minded antidote to the Capitol\u2019s seemingly intransigent partisanship.\u201cI know how disappointing it is to people,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said in an interview last summer, explaining his decision not to support Ms. Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing for very legitimate, really important reasons. Like, I also want to be in the majority.\u201dHe added that Ms. Jones would make an excellent congresswoman if elected.Party officials and activists kept up the pressure, cornering him at rallies and fund-raisers, including one in San Antonio where Mr. O\u2019Rourke raised his right hand in a mock ceremony and pledged not to make Mr. Hurd \u201clook cool\u201d even as he refused to oppose him.\u201cBasically I told him he needed to dance with who brung him,\u201d said Mary Bell Lockhart, the chairwoman of the Brewster County Democratic Party. \u201cAnd it was primarily Democrats.\u201dImageMr. O\u2019Rourke is a prolific fund-raiser who proved he can energize younger voters. Some early polls place him third behind Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders, well ahead of many more decorated politicians who might seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.CreditTodd Heisler/The New York TimesMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s supporters insist he can be counted on to pursue Democratic priorities, while noting that his relationship with Mr. Hurd allowed the two to collaborate on shared causes like border policy. (Mr. Hurd has been a rare Republican opposing the construction of a wall.)But Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s history with the party is more complicated than it appeared in a binary race against Mr. Cruz, whom Democrats could generally agree to loathe. He was known in Washington for declining to pay dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In 2016, he voted against Nancy Pelosi to lead the Democratic caucus, supporting Tim Ryan, a centrist from Ohio.\u201cWe are all products of our environment,\u201d said Pete Gallego, a former Democratic congressman who lost his seat to Mr. Hurd in 2014. \u201cHe has found tremendous success by shaking things up and by not being part of the party apparatus.\u201dAfter Ms. Jones won the Democratic nomination for the seat, she and Mr. O\u2019Rourke had a cordial conversation by telephone. Mr. O\u2019Rourke neither pledged to help Ms. Jones nor told her directly that he would be withholding his support, according to people briefed on the call.In late June, Ronald Smith, a liberal activist in Mr. Hurd\u2019s district, emailed Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign demanding to know: \u201cHas Beto endorsed Gina Ortiz Jones? If not, when will he endorse her?\u201d Mr. Smith said he wanted \u201ca team player for my next Democratic senator.\u201dAn O\u2019Rourke campaign representative offered a noncommittal reply in an email reviewed by The New York Times: \u201cWe are evaluating some local and regional races at this time.\u201dBy the summer, aides to Mr. O\u2019Rourke had made clear to Ms. Jones\u2019s campaign that he would not support her candidacy, three Democrats familiar with the exchange said. Mr. O\u2019Rourke valued his relationship with Mr. Hurd and was mentioning it frequently on the campaign trail, as he sought to win crossover support from right-of-center voters.Ms. Jones, who has said she is likely to run again in 2020, declined through an aide to be interviewed about Mr. O\u2019Rourke.Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s defenders note that several Democrats benefited from his stronger-than-expected showing against Mr. Cruz, helping the party flip congressional seats in the Houston and Dallas areas.But in no other swing district was Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s allegiance in question. Mr. O\u2019Rourke carried the 23rd District even as Mr. Hurd narrowly won re-election there. In the section of the district that spills into Bexar County, home to San Antonio, Mr. O\u2019Rourke outperformed Mr. Cruz by about 3,900 votes, a review of precinct-level election results found. The same set of precincts voted for Mr. Hurd over Ms. Jones by nearly 4,700 votes. Mr. Hurd won the district by just over 900 votes.\u201cWe know exactly what the Beto bump was and it was amazing,\u201d said Mr. Smith, the liberal activist. \u201cBut my assessment was, for Democrats, as well as we did this last election cycle, we would have had one more seat if Beto had been on board with Gina Ortiz Jones.\u201d"}, {"title": "How Do You Govern Machines That Can Learn?

The subject was artificial intelligence, and his students last week were mainly senior policymakers from countries in the 36-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Mr. Abelson began with a brisk history of machine learning, starting in the 1950s. Next came a description of how the technology works, a hands-on project using computer-vision models and then case studies. The goal was to give the policymakers from countries like France, Japan and Sweden a sense of the technology\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing the crucial role of human choices.\u201cThese machines do what they do because they are trained,\u201d Mr. Abelson said.The class was part of a three-day gathering at M.I.T., including expert panels, debate and discussion, as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development seeks to agree on recommendations for artificial intelligence policy by this summer.But where are policymakers supposed to even start? Artificial intelligence seems to be everywhere, much hyped, much feared yet little understood. Some proclaim A.I. will be an elixir of prosperity, while others warn it will be a job killer, even an existential threat to humanity.The organization\u2019s declarations, when they come, will not carry the force of law. But its recommendations have a track record of setting standards in many countries, including guidelines, going back to 1980, that called on nations to enact legislation to protect privacy and defined personal data as any information that can be used to identify an individual.The recommendations carry weight because the organization\u2019s mission is to foster responsible economic development, balancing innovation and social protections.ImageHal Abelson of M.I.T. led a session about artificial intelligence for the attendees, who represented countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.CreditKayana Szymczak for The New York Times\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to get out in front and help create some sort of policy coherence,\u201d said Andrew Wyckoff, the group\u2019s director for science, technology and innovation.Here are a few themes that emerged at the gathering \u2014 ideas that could help shape the debate for years to come.Rules are needed to make the world safe for A.I. \u2014 and let A.I. flourish.Regulation is coming. That\u2019s a good thing. Rules of competition and behavior are the foundation of healthy, growing markets.That was the consensus of the policymakers at M.I.T. But they also agreed that artificial intelligence raises some fresh policy challenges.Today\u2019s machine-learning systems are so complex, digesting so much data, that explaining how they make decisions may be impossible. So do you just test for results? Do you put self-driving cars through a driver\u2019s test? If an A.I. system predicts breast cancer better than humans on average, do you just go with the machine? Probably.\u201cIt\u2019s very clear \u2014 you have to use it,\u201d said Regina Barzilay, an M.I.T. computer scientist and a breast cancer survivor.But handing off a growing array of decisions is uncomfortable terrain. Practical rules that reassure the public are the only path toward A.I. adoption.ImageCreditKayana Szymczak for The New York Times\u201cIf you want people to trust this stuff, government has to play a role,\u201d said Daniel Weitzner, a principal research scientist at the M.I.T. Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, who was a policy adviser in the Obama administration.Everyone, not just the superpowers, wants to shape A.I. policy.New regulation is often equated with slower growth. But the policymakers at the event said they did not want to stop the A.I. train. Instead, they said, they want their countries fully on board. Nations that have explicit A.I. strategies, like France and Canada, consider the technology an engine of growth, and seek to educate and recruit the next generation of researchers.\u201cMachine learning is the next truly disruptive technology,\u201d said Elissa Strome, who oversees A.I. strategy at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, a government-funded organization. \u201cThere are huge opportunities for machine learning in fields like energy, environment, transportation and health care.\u201dInternational cooperation, the attendees said, would help ensure that policymaking was not simply left by default to the A.I. superpowers: the United States, which is a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and China, which is not.\u201cWe think there can be a new model for the development of artificial intelligence that differs from China or California,\u201d said Bertrand Pailh\u00e8s, the national coordinator for France\u2019s A.I. strategy.In the view of Mr. Pailh\u00e8s and others, China is a government-controlled surveillance state. In the American model, coming from Silicon Valley in California, a handful of internet companies become big winners and society is treated as a data-generating resource to be strip mined.\u201cThe era of moving fast and breaking everything is coming to a close,\u201d said R. David Edelman, an adviser in the Obama administration and the director of the project on technology, policy and national security at M.I.T.ImageFrom left, Susumu Hirano, Osamu Sudoh and Nobuhisa Nishigata, advisers to the government in Japan, which is investing heavily in the development of A.I. technology.CreditKayana Szymczak for The New York TimesIn Japan, artificial intelligence is being seized as a lever to spur dynamism in its stodgy, hierarchical corporate culture. Japan is investing heavily to encourage the development of A.I. technology with a particular emphasis on \u201cstart-ups, small companies and young people,\u201d said Osamu Sudoh, a professor at the University of Tokyo and a senior adviser to the Japanese government on A.I. strategy.A.I. policy is data policy.One specific policy issue dominated all others: the collection, handling and use of data.Fast computers and clever algorithms are important, but the recent explosion of digital data \u2014 from the web, smartphones, sensors, genomics and elsewhere \u2014 is the oxygen of modern A.I.\u201cAccess to data is going to be the most important thing\u201d for advancing science, said Antonio Torralba, director of the M.I.T. Quest for Intelligence project. So much data is held privately that without rules on privacy and liability, data will not be shared and advances in fields like health care will by stymied.Artificial intelligence can magnify the danger of data-driven injustice. Public-interest advocates point to the troubling missteps with the technology \u2014 software, for example, that fails to recognize the faces of black women or crime-prediction programs used in courtrooms that discriminate against African-Americans.In such cases, data is the problem. The results were biased because the data that went into them was biased \u2014 skewed toward white males for facial recognition and the comparatively high percentage of African-Americans in the prison population.\u201cAre we just going to make the current racist system more effective, or are we going to get rid of embedded bias?\u201d asked Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts.These are issues of both technology design and policy. \u201cWho is being mistreated? Who is being left out?\u201d Mr. Abelson asked the class. \u201cAs you think about regulation, that is what you should be thinking about.\u201d"}, {"title": "Carlos Ghosn Offers Higher Bail and Security Guards in Bid to Be Freed From Jail", "category": "Business", "id": "69856dd6-1c3d-432a-8599-06410fc62706", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/business/carlos-ghosn-bail-japan.html", "publishdate": 20190120, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/21/business/21ghosn/merlin_149295801_aa42407d-338b-435b-b948-9f9fde16befd-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "TOKYO \u2014 Carlos Ghosn, the embattled global auto executive who has spent the last two months jailed in Japan, is offering to post a higher bail amount and personally pay for an apartment in Tokyo along with private security guards as he prepares a case seeking his release before trial.Mr. Ghosn, 64, who has been charged on three counts of financial misconduct at Nissan Motor, the Japanese auto company he led for two decades, was denied bail by a Tokyo court last week. The court rejected an appeal by his lawyers, who made a new bail application to the district court in Tokyo on Friday.\u201cAs the court considers my bail application, I want to emphasize that I will reside in Japan and respect any and all bail conditions the court concludes are warranted,\u201d Mr. Ghosn said in a statement released to the news media on Monday morning.Mr. Ghosn, until recently the head of the car-making alliance of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi, is making new assurances in support of his bail request in Tokyo as Renault, the French automaker, is preparing to cut ties with him  under pressure from the French government, a shareholder in Renault.Tokyo prosecutors have charged Mr. Ghosn, who was a rare foreign celebrity executive leading a Japanese company, with understating his income for years and with improperly transferring personal investment losses to Nissan\u2019s books in 2008. In a court appearance this month, Mr. Ghosn declared he was innocent of all allegations.Since he was arrested coming off a corporate jet in Tokyo on Nov. 19, Mr. Ghosn has been detained in a small cell, and questioned daily by prosecutors without his lawyer present. He has been cut off from any direct contact with his family, and until last week he was allowed to see only his Japanese lawyer and diplomats from Brazil, France and Lebanon, countries in which he holds citizenship. His wife, Carole Ghosn, wrote last week to Human Rights Watch, a global advocacy group, saying her husband had been \u201ccallously and needlessly detained by the authorities in Japan.\u201dWhen Mr. Ghosn appeared before a judge this month to exercise his legal right to request that the court explain its reasoning for approving his continued detention, the judge said Mr. Ghosn was viewed as a possible flight risk and could conceal evidence.In his statement on Monday, Mr. Ghosn said that if released on bail, he was committed to appearing at his trial.\u201cI will attend my trial not only because I am legally obligated to do so, but because I am eager to finally have the opportunity to defend myself,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is more important to me or to my family.\u201dA spokeswoman for Mr. Ghosn\u2019s family, Devon Spurgeon, said the family had leased an apartment in Tokyo where he would stay while awaiting trial. This month, Nissan terminated the lease on the $12,750-a-month apartment in Tokyo that Mr. Ghosn used as chairman.Ms. Spurgeon said Mr. Ghosn was also offering to pay a higher bail amount by offering as collateral Nissan stock not listed in his original bail application. He would also wear and pay for the cost of an electric ankle bracelet as well as hire private security guards approved by prosecutors to monitor him. Mr. Ghosn would surrender all his passports and refrain from talking to potential witnesses in his case.Along with Mr. Ghosn, Tokyo prosecutors have indicted his close aide Greg Kelly, a former human resources executive and member of Nissan\u2019s board, on charges he underreported Mr. Ghosn\u2019s income. Mr. Kelly was released on bail of 70 million yen, or about $640,000, on Christmas Day. He has undergone surgery for spinal stenosis in Tokyo and is now living in an apartment in the city."}, {"title": "BuzzFeed News in Limbo Land", "category": "Business", "id": "025a80c3-4e1b-48e7-a702-31f3b688b14a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/business/media/buzzfeed-trump-mueller-backlash.html", "publishdate": 20190120, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/21/business/21jpRutenberg2-print/merlin_148026393_dd201819-bb5e-47b0-a239-f129f658f03f-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "This is, in many respects, a golden age for journalism.With a president facing multiple federal and state inquiries \u2014 including one into whether a foreign government helped get him elected \u2014 the press has come through with some investigative work that can stand with the finest Watergate-era reporting.Among readers and viewers, there\u2019s a new appreciation for shoe-leather reporting. Clicks and subscriptions are up, welcome news for an industry in shaky financial shape.But the ultimate prize has proved elusive for the scoop-hungry journalists competing to join the reporters\u2019 pantheon alongside Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, whose methodical news-gathering for The Washington Post helped bring down a president alleged to have broken the law.The perils of the chase were plain to see on Friday night, when the office of the special counsel issued a public denial of what had been widely portrayed as a \u201cbombshell report\u201d from BuzzFeed News.The site, based in New York, has been as aggressive as any other news outlet in trying to break the Big One. Its latest attempt, published Thursday night, reported that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had evidence that President Trump had instructed his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen to lie to Congress.In their race to get ahead of Mr. Mueller with news that will please much of the electorate while also driving clicks and ratings, however, journalists throughout the media have produced their share of misfires and unforced errors. Each mistake has been a gift to the president, providing fodder for his case that any unflattering reporting about him amounts to \u201cfake news,\u201d and that the special counsel\u2019s investigation is nothing but a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dThe insatiable appetite of social media and cable news for fresh material makes the hunt for big stories even more perilous.\u201cI say to you on the record, I am thankful I don\u2019t have to cover this story on a daily basis,\u201d said Mr. Woodward, whose latest book, \u201cFear,\u201d a fly-on-the-wall view of the Trump administration\u2019s first year, has sold some two million copies.\u201cThe hydraulic pressure in the system is just so great,\u201d he added. \u201cThe impatience of the internet \u2014 \u2018give it to us immediately\u2019 \u2014 drives so much, it\u2019s hard to sort something like this out.\u201dBuzzFeed\u2019s business model is built on that immediacy. Its newsroom is part of an organization whose mission is to find or create viral content. So you have serious journalism sitting almost side by side with lighthearted listicles like \u201c28 Ryan Reynolds Tweets About Parenting That Will Make You Laugh Out Loud.\u201dBuzzFeed News has produced top-flight work. But in fashioning itself as a 21st-century upstart challenging the traditionalists, it has also pushed the limits.It was the first to publish the collection of reports that were put together by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele during the 2016 presidential campaign. Known as the dossier, the 35-page file was filled with what were at least then-unsubstantiated (and salacious) reports about Mr. Trump said to have been collected by Russian agents for blackmail purposes. Other news organizations, including this one, had all or part of the dossier, but decided against publishing any of its contents they couldn\u2019t independently verify.The BuzzFeed News editor in chief, Ben Smith, argued that the dossier was worthy of release without full journalistic corroboration, partly because its contents had been shared with President Trump and others \u201cat the highest levels of the U.S. government.\u201d Providing that level of transparency, he argued, was \u201chow we see the job of reporters in 2017.\u201dBuzzFeed\u2019s report last week was more traditional, providing information from \u201ctwo federal law enforcement officials,\u201d as the article described its sources. According to the piece, Mr. Mueller was in possession of documents, text messages and testimony from Mr. Cohen showing that Mr. Trump had directed him to lie to Congress about Trump business dealings in Moscow in 2016.BuzzFeed said the report was months in the making. But, given the weightiness of the accusations, the final push for input from Mr. Mueller\u2019s office appears to have taken place on internet time.ImageBuzzFeed News reported that the president had instructed his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen to lie to Congress, igniting a social media and cable news firestorm.CreditChang W. Lee/The New York TimesJason Leopold, one of the article\u2019s co-writers, sent a heads-up email to Mr. Mueller\u2019s spokesman, Peter Carr, only several hours before publication. In the exchange, which was first reported by The Washington Post, Mr. Leopold said that he was planning to report \u201cMichael Cohen was directed by President Trump himself to lie to Congress about his negotiations related to the Trump Moscow project.\u201dThe email did not mention that the article would also assert that Mr. Mueller had substantial evidence of the supposed presidential marching orders \u2014 a vital component that gave the story so much apparent heft.To be fair, Fortress Mueller has been a frustration for reporters. The special counsel\u2019s office has kept leaks to a minimum while refusing, for the most part, to confirm or deny whatever report about its work is firing up the news algorithm. While its impenetrability may explain the BuzzFeed reporters\u2019 casual-seeming approach, it\u2019s not much of an excuse for skipping the steps taught in Journalism 101.The Mueller team\u2019s challenge to the BuzzFeed report is also exposing the flaws of the wider media ecosystem, which is all too ready to spring into action at any sign of the Big One. Within minutes of the article\u2019s publication on Thursday, Twitter was ablaze, and cable panelists were effusive. \u201cThis is stunning,\u201d Don Lemon said on CNN. Lawrence O\u2019Donnell spoke of \u201ca Nixonian moment\u201d on MSNBC.Fox News reported the article\u2019s claims as potentially an \u201cenormous, enormous problem for this presidency.\u201d But the guest who described it that way, the Fox News contributor Guy Benson, also warned, \u201cProceed with caution on this story \u2014 it may be true, it may not.\u201dBy the following morning, other news organizations had failed to match the BuzzFeed piece with their own reporting and increasingly included \u201cif true\u201d caveats \u2014 but that didn\u2019t prevent hours of on-air speculation about the potential implications of \u201csubornation of perjury,\u201d with its echoes of Watergate.Even after the special counsel\u2019s statement on Friday night, Rachel Maddow of MSNBC speculated that it wasn\u2019t a true denial. During an interview with Mr. Smith, she asked, \u201cDo you have any concern that this statement from the special counsel\u2019s office might be an effort to dissuade you and dissuade your reporters from pursuing this, even if it is accurate, either because it interferes with the special counsel\u2019s investigation in some way or it is otherwise too uncomfortable for this Justice Department?\u201dThe further the disputed report traveled, the more it seemed to help Mr. Trump, who is forever on the lookout for material for the most intensive anti-press branding campaign ever to come from the Oval Office.As the former Associated Press top editor Kathleen Carroll described the current reporting environment to me: \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very, very high wire, with a load of rusty razor blades underneath it.\u201dMr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein know better than most what BuzzFeed\u2019s reporters and editors are now going through. During their history-making run, the duo misreported that a grand jury had received specific testimony about a secret slush fund controlled by Nixon\u2019s chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman. The grand jury portion of the story was wrong, and the White House pounced on the error. But the substance was correct, and history ultimately vindicated them.Mr. Smith, the BuzzFeed News editor, told me that the special counsel\u2019s office was \u201cgnomic\u201d in its denial. \u201cWe are confident that our reporting will stand up,\u201d he said.For now, the story has fallen into a nether region occupied by two other recent, potentially groundbreaking stories on the Mueller investigation that have yet to be confirmed by others.The first is a report  from the McClatchy newspaper chain that cellphone signals placed Mr. Cohen near Prague in 2016, around the same time the Steele dossier placed him there for a meeting with Russian officials.And there was the report in The Guardian that President Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had paid a visit to Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks, before that organization released a trove of emails that the United States has accused Russian agents of stealing from the Democrats.With the BuzzFeed story joining those two reports in journalistic limbo land, there are two options for the hair-trigger, Russia-investigation commentariat, said Richard Tofel, the president of ProPublica, the investigative news organization.\u201cOne is, try to figure out right this minute what the truth is, when you have no way of knowing,\u201d Mr. Tofel said. \u201cOr two, and both social media and cable news are a little bit at war with this: Wait a minute.\u201d"}, {"title": "In Iowa, Gillibrand Uses Small-Town Roots to Sell Electability", "category": "Politics", "id": "a77a7c4c-bb57-484d-865b-28dee6e011a6", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-iowa-president.html", "publishdate": 20190120, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/20/us/politics/20altgillibrand-print/gillibrand-1--articleLarge.jpg", "content": "BOONE, Iowa \u2014 Senator Kirsten Gillibrand represents one of the biggest and bluest states in America, anchored by the nation\u2019s largest urban metropolis. But as she made her way across snowy Iowa during her first visit as a presidential candidate, Ms. Gillibrand put far more emphasis on her upstate New York roots, bipartisanship and small-town political ancestry.She talked about her love of RVs and her family vacation last summer to see a Nascar race \u2014 and suggested she could make an RV trip in Iowa this year. She spoke of her faith and finding common ground with Republicans. And she harked back repeatedly to her first run for Congress, in 2006, when she ousted a Republican incumbent in a seat that her pollster warned she couldn\u2019t win because there were \u201cmore cows than Democrats.\u201d\u201cI grew up in upstate New York, a community not unlike this one,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said as she introduced herself at a house party in Sioux City on Friday evening. Of her first race, she said, \u201cIt was a two-to-one Republican district, a lot like the district we\u2019re in today.\u201dThe next morning, inside a cafe in Boone, she told the dozen or so people there: \u201cI really appreciate being in a rural place. I\u2019m from a rural place. I grew up in a rural place. I represented a rural place for Congress.\u201dAt a political moment when many Democratic voters are desperate to find a winner who can beat President Trump, Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s emphasis on her past representing a conservative House seat seemed an effort to ensure she is not pigeonholed as just another blue-state Democrat, or someone who does not understand rural America.To that end, Ms. Gillibrand has placed her campaign headquarters in Troy, N.Y., near where she grew up and in her old House district but relatively far from a major urban center (though a short drive to New Hampshire). She made her first campaign appearance at a diner there, too.\u201cThe thing she really reiterates is she isn\u2019t from New York. She\u2019s from upstate,\u201d said J.D. Scholten, a Democrat who lost his 2018 House race to Representative Steve King, the Iowa Republican who has come under fire for his remarks on white supremacy and white nationalism.Mr. Scholten, who attended two of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s events, said the problem with the current Democratic Party is that it\u2019s \u201cmore and more a Whole Foods party and we\u2019re in a Dollar General district.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s able to have that experience,\u201d Mr. Scholten said of Ms. Gillibrand, \u201cand that\u2019s important for Democrats.\u201dThe challenge for Ms. Gillibrand is that the candidate she was, ideologically, in 2006 to win that upstate district is no longer the candidate she is now. In the House, she had an A-rating from the National Rifle Association; now she has an F. Her stances on immigration have flipped, as well. She has said she is now embarrassed by her old positions.Ms. Gillibrand, who appears especially comfortable meeting voters in small and more intimate settings, was generally well-received on her first Iowa trip, which included a mix of coffee-shop stops and business tours, a house party and a speech to the Women\u2019s March at the State Capitol.\u201cIf we change who\u2019s at the decision-making table, we change everything,\u201d she told the crowd at the march. (Ms. Gillibrand also said there was \u201cno room for anti-Semitism\u201d in the Women\u2019s March movement, a reference to the controversy involving one of the original march organizers that has caused fewer national Democrats to attend this year.)ImageMs. Gillibrand at a brewery in Des Moines on Saturday. Her views on gun control and immigration have changed since she was elected as a U.S. Representative in rural New York.CreditRachel Mummey for The New York TimesUnlike Senator Elizabeth Warren, another Democratic contender, who has mostly avoided mentioning Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, Ms. Gillibrand offered plenty of direct attacks on the president, saying he had brought a \u201cdarkness\u201d on the nation, using words like \u201cheartless,\u201d \u201cimmoral,\u201d \u201cinhumane\u201d and \u201cbeyond disgraceful,\u201d and citing his \u201cracist message.\u201dOf the federal shutdown under Mr. Trump, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s doing it all for himself and his own ego.\u201dBut almost as often as she mentioned her voting record against Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda or appointments, Ms. Gillibrand cited her across-the-aisle work with Republicans, including how she bonded with Senator Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, at Bible study, and name-dropping her alliance with Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican reviled by many Democrats, in her legislative battles on sexual assault in the military.\u201cI can work with anybody,\u201d she said to laughs after mentioning Mr. Cruz.In Boone, a town of about 12,500 people, a 43-year-old Iowan, Chris Bennett, asked Ms. Gillibrand to say what separated her most from what could be a sprawling field of two dozen or more Democratic candidates in 2020.\u201cI really believe that I can bring this country together,\u201d she began her answer.Voters mostly responded positively.\u201cWe\u2019ve had enough divisiveness over the last couple years,\u201d said Amy Young, a college professor, whom Ms. Gillibrand pitched about finding common ground at a coffee shop in Ames. \u201cWe are one country. We need to remember that.\u201dLinda Santi, who met Ms. Gillibrand in Sioux City, said: \u201cShe talked about running in a red congressional district. That was important to me. How do we talk? How do we engage Trump voters in civil discourse?\u201dMs. Santi saw Ms. Warren on her recent visit \u2014 Iowans famously love to size up their presidential candidates in person before making a decision \u2014 and said Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s arrival was far more \u201cdownscale\u201d: no street vendors hawking goods, no organized selfie line.\u201cWarren was pressing the populist button in more of an us-them kind of way,\u201d Ms. Santi said.In Sioux City, Ms. Gillibrand did get a question about her decision to become the first Democratic senator to call for the resignation of the former senator Al Franken in late 2017 following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. Some Democratic donors and activists had lamented his departure and her role in it.\u201cEnough was enough,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said of the final allegation.\u201cAl Franken was entitled to whatever process he wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he wanted to stay and wait six months for his ethics hearing, he was entitled to whatever he wanted. His decision was to resign. My decision was not to remain silent.\u201dSeveral people at her events said they learned much of what they know about her from television appearance this week, including on Rachel Maddow\u2019s show on MSNBC, where Ms. Gillibrand was a guest. Ms. Maddow opened the interview by dissecting Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s shifting stances.\u201cTell me about that transformation,\u201d Ms. Maddow pointedly began her questioning.\u201cI understand her policy positions have evolved,\u201d said Rick Mullin, 65, who attended the house party with Ms. Gillibrand in Sioux City. He was sympathetic. His positions have shifted, too. \u201cNot as much as hers have,\u201d he added.Ms. Gillibrand remains widely unknown. People quietly asked each other who the blonde woman with the media entourage was at a coffee shop in Des Moines. And as she entered the state Capitol for the Women\u2019s March speech, the security guard asked her, \u201cSo when are you running for president?\u201d\u201cRight now!\u201d she replied."}, {"title": "Amazon Knows What You Buy.

Amazon\u2019s advertising business is worth about $125 billion, more than Nike or IBM, Morgan Stanley estimates. At its core are ads placed on Amazon.com by makers of toilet paper or soap that want to appear near product search results on the site.But many ad agencies are particularly excited by another area of advertising that is less obvious to many consumers. The company has been steadily expanding its business of selling video or display ads \u2014 the square and rectangular ads on sites across the web \u2014 and gaining ground on the industry leaders, Google and Facebook.In addition to knowing what people buy, Amazon also knows where people live, because they provide delivery addresses, and which credit cards they use. It knows how old their children are from their baby registries, and who has a cold, right now, from cough syrup ordered for two-hour delivery. And the company has been expanding a self-service option for ad agencies and brands to take advantage of its data on shoppers.\u201cThat is where the insane scale can happen for the business,\u201d said John Denny, a vice president at CAVU Venture Partners, which invests in consumer brands like Bulletproof coffee and Hippeas chickpea puffs.Major online ad networks offer different ways to target customers. A brand that sells running shirts for women might turn to Google to find people who the company believes are female and interested in running based on their search and browsing history. The company may turn to Facebook for people in a women\u2019s running group.Many of Amazon\u2019s features are similar to those of Google or Facebook, like offering ways to target users based on their interests, searches and demographics. But Amazon\u2019s ad system can also remove a lot of the guesswork by showing ads to people who have bought the shirts on Amazon.com.Advertisers have long run some targeted campaigns through Amazon\u2019s ad network. Many have done that by working directly with Amazon\u2019s staff, who would place their orders on their behalf. That option has historically been focused on larger brands because it requires a minimum advertising commitment. Over time, Amazon has given more advertisers and their agencies access to the self-service system to run their own targeting campaigns on and off Amazon\u2019s websites, and at a variety of spending levels.Users of the self-service system can choose from hundreds of automated audience segments. Some of Amazon\u2019s targeting capabilities are dependent on shopping behaviors, such as \u201cInternational Market Grocery Shopper\u201d and people who have bought \u201cAcne Treatments\u201d in the past month, or household demographics, such as \u201cPresence of children aged 4-6.\u201d Others are based on the media people consume on Amazon, such as \u201cDenzel Washington Fans\u201d or people who have recently streamed fitness and exercise videos on Amazon. The company declined to comment.Just the Cheese, a brand run by Specialty Cheese Company in Reeseville, Wis., makes crunchy dried cheese bars that have taken off as a low-carb snack. By using algorithms to analyze how Just the Cheese\u2019s search ads performed on Amazon\u2019s site, the ad agency Quartile Digital noticed that people who searched for keto snacks and cauliflower pizza crust, both low-carb diet trends, also bought a lot of cheese bars. So Quartile ran display ads across the web targeting Amazon customers who had bought those two specific product categories. Over three months, Amazon showed the ads on websites more than six million times, which resulted in almost 22,000 clicks and more than 4,000 orders.That 20 percent conversion rate \u2014 a sale to one out of five people who clicked on the ads \u2014 was \u201camazing,\u201d Mr. Knijnik said. \u201cThat is the kind of powerful granularity for building the target audiences that just Amazon can give you.\u201dLike other ad networks, Amazon uses cookies and other technical tools to track customers from its site onto other websites. They let the company know that a person who recently bought a diet book is now reading news on CNN and could be targeted on that site with an ad for a protein bar. Amazon does not tell the advertisers who that user is, but it does serve her ads on the brand\u2019s behalf.Last year, Amazon released a tool similar to those used by some other ad networks. That tool embeds a piece of computer code known as a pixel in ads shown on other sites, and tracks how that particular ad placement leads to customers viewing a product on Amazon or buying it outright.\u201cThey want more branding dollars, those TV dollars; that is really part of the reason they launched that advertising attribution data,\u201d said Melissa Burdick, who worked on Amazon\u2019s ad teams before leaving to found Pacvue, which provides tools for brands to optimize Amazon ads.Aside from shopping habits, consumers give Amazon other information that it uses to aim ads. For example, Amazon\u2019s website has a section called \u201cGarage,\u201d where customers can submit their car\u2019s make and model information to make sure they buy parts that fit. In 2015, Amazon used Garage data to help an auto insurer target specific customers, according to a case study on its site. Now, on their own, brands can choose to show ads to drivers who have an Acura MDX as opposed to people who have an Acura TL via Amazon\u2019s ad portal.Amazon has slowly been developing ways for brands to target their own customers and shoppers, like other ad networks have offered for a while. Advertisers can upload their own customer lists, which Amazon matches with its database, and then show ads to those customers, or other people Amazon\u2019s algorithms determine are similar.Mr. Denny of CAVU Venture Partners pointed to one of his firm\u2019s investments, One Brands, which sells protein bars on Amazon. The company can retarget customers who looked at the product page for its birthday cake-flavored bars, as well as so-called look-alike audiences that lets One Brands find consumers whose shopping behavior Amazon has determined is similar to people who have bought the bars before.It not only finds those customers, but Amazon automatically shows different ads to different people based on their shopping behavior. People who do a lot of research on products may see an ad that features positive product reviews, whereas those who have signed up for regular deliveries of other products in the past might see an ad offering a discount for those who \u201cSubscribe & Save.\u201d\u201cEarly tests are showing this is insanely powerful,\u201d Mr. Denny said. \u201cThey can do this and nobody else can come close.\u201d"}, {"title": "The Stock Market Is Making a Comeback.

It\u2019s the best start to a year since 1987.Even so, many factors behind last year\u2019s troubling decline remain unresolved. American companies and consumers are less optimistic about the future, and large economies like Germany and China are signaling a global slowdown driven by the trade war. Britain is in turmoil over leaving the European Union. And a new concern, the longest federal government shutdown in history, also poses a risk to the domestic economy.A month ago, any one of those elements might have fueled a steep decline in stocks. In December, waves of panic-driven selling left the S&P 500 dangling almost 20 percent below its high. Now, it\u2019s all being taken in stride.The difference is an abrupt change in tone from the Federal Reserve. This year began with repeated public assurances from Fed officials that they were sensitive to concerns about the economy and would be patient and flexible as they decided whether to raise interest rates.Investors were alarmed last year by the idea that the central bank was determined to keep raising rates, risking a recession. It wasn\u2019t just Wall Street that worried. As stocks were sliding in December, President Trump, who boasted about stocks as they rose earlier in the year, became fixated on the Fed and its chairman, Jerome H. Powell. \u201cThe only problem our economy has is the Fed,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Dec. 24.\u201cThey\u2019re trying their best to be a source of stability in markets,\u201d said Samantha Azzarello, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management. \u201cWhat happened last year really shook people and their confidence in investing in equities.\u201dThe Fed has always held sway over the financial markets, but that influence tends to grow in the later stages of an expansion, when every interest rate increase is seen as the one that might trip up the economy.The United States economy is still strong: The unemployment rate is near 50-year lows, wages are starting to rise and growth in corporate profits remains robust. To the Fed, these are reasons to keep raising borrowing costs and stave off potential inflation. It did so four times in 2018.But after 10 years of economic growth, many investors are worried that a turning point is near, and that higher interest rates might bring on a slowdown faster than they expect. And the recent stock market gains may not stick without proof that corporate profits can keep growing.\u201cWe\u2019re in a bit of a \u2018show me\u2019 moment for skeptical and uncertain investors,\u201d said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investment firm. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be backed up with earnings and the confidence that those earnings are going to be sustainable.\u201dThis past week, American companies began disclosing their sales and profits for the fourth quarter. With about 10 percent of companies in the S&P 500 posting results, the reports have been strong.After the S&P 500 rose 2.9 percent in the week through Friday, it is up 13.6 percent from its Dec. 24 low. The stock index ended trading on Friday just below its 2018 starting point.However, earnings reports reflect only what happened in the past. When it comes to how they will do in 2019, some large businesses have cautioned that they don\u2019t have a clear view.Ford recently warned that the trade war and Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union made it impossible to offer investors a forecast. The homebuilder Lennar did the same, blaming weakness and uncertainty in the housing market.Broad surveys of sentiment also suggest reason for worry. On Friday, the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index fell to the lowest point of the Trump presidency and well below forecasters\u2019 expectations. Earlier in the week, a report from the Fed showed that, through early January, executives and economists had become less optimistic for a host of reasons, including trade and political uncertainty and swings in the financial markets.The data in that report came before the government shutdown had stretched to nearly a month. Now the longest in United States history, the closing will start to take a toll. The latest estimates from the White House\u2019s own Council of Economic Advisers suggest that the shutdown has already knocked almost half a percentage point off the economy\u2019s growth rate, though that drag should end once the government reopens.The shutdown is affecting some large businesses already. On Tuesday, Delta Air Lines cautioned that reduced travel by government officials and contractors would hurt its sales growth, at a rate of about $25 million a month. JPMorgan Chase executives noted that if the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 currently closed except for emergency matters \u2014 was not able to give approvals for stock market share offerings, and mergers went unapproved by other government agencies, it could cut fee revenue for its investment banking operations.Profits at American companies may be hurt by the United States\u2019 trade war with China. Evidence that it is slowing global growth mounted this past week, with Germany reporting its slowest annual growth rate since 2013 and China saying that exports fell last month.Companies in the S&P 500 generate 37 percent of their sales, on average, from markets outside the United States, according to the data provider FactSet, and businesses that have increased their exposure to global economies now look vulnerable.But for the most part, stock investors have shrugged off these concerns in January, now that they see the Fed as less eager to raise rates.The Fed had spooked investors as recently as Dec. 19, when it raised interest rates, and its chairman, Mr. Powell, said he didn\u2019t see a need for the central bank to change the way it has been slowly selling off the bonds it bought to bolster the economy over the last decade. The stock market slid 6 percent in the days afterward.\u201cClearly the market was skittish about, primarily, the Fed,\u201d said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. \u201cIt sounded like the Fed was on autopilot.\u201dBy Jan. 4, Mr. Powell\u2019s comments had a different tone. Speaking at a public panel discussion, he made a point of emphasizing the Fed\u2019s ability to be patient with further interest rate increases, given that inflation remains low.\u201cWe\u2019re listening with, you know, sensitively to the message that \u2014 that markets are sending,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to be taking those downside risks into account as we make policy going forward.\u201dWithin days, other central bank officials repeated the sentiment, and the Fed published the details of its December meeting, which showed that many of its policymakers had already reached that conclusion. Stocks had already bounced off their Christmas Eve low when Mr. Powell spoke, but have gained 9.1 percent since.\u201cTheir commentary has really done a 180 in a really short period of time,\u201d said David Giroux, chief investment officer of United States equity at asset manager T. Rowe Price.Over the last 30 years, investors have grown accustomed to looking to the Fed for help when the market found itself in a sticky spot. Some trace the phenomenon to the October 1987 market crash. The morning after stocks tumbled roughly 20 percent in a single day, the Fed, under the recently appointed Alan Greenspan, issued a statement indicating that it was ready to support the economic and financial system.Stocks rebounded sharply, helping to embed an expectation into the markets that continues today. And, in the past decade, as stocks have climbed in their longest run of gains ever, the Fed\u2019s decisions to back away from plans to raise interest rates or withdraw economic stimulus have helped keep the bull market alive.Mr. Powell and the Fed seem to have done that again.\u201cI think his comments on Jan. 4 were critical to getting excitement and willingness to invest back into the market,\u201d Ms. Levine said."}, {"title": "BuzzFeed News Faces Scrutiny After Mueller Denies a Dramatic Trump Report", "category": "Business", "id": "ba4d4a1d-9bc1-40b1-8f50-8761603d0e08", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/business/media/buzzfeed-news-trump-michael-cohen-mueller.html", "publishdate": 20190120, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/20/business/20BUZZFEED/20BUZZFEED-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "In an age of unyielding appetite for all things Trump, big news travels fast.So when BuzzFeed News reported on Thursday that the president had instructed his lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie in his testimony to Congress \u2014 a felony \u2014 the assertion ricocheted around the cable TV ecosystem and into the halls of Congress, where Democratic lawmakers publicly mused on impeachment.Unlike past articles on the possible ties between Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia, however, this one was not followed by similar stories from other news organizations, who proved unable to corroborate its findings with reporting of their own. And on Friday, the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, broke precedent by issuing a denial, interrupting nearly 20 months of silence from Mr. Mueller on news reports swirling around his investigation.Whether BuzzFeed\u2019s reporting can stand up to further scrutiny is now at the center of a test of the news media\u2019s credibility. President Trump seized on the special counsel\u2019s denial to continue making the case that the press is biased against him. Journalists expressed the worry that a retraction could undermine Americans\u2019 trust in their work.BuzzFeed News said on Saturday that it remained confident in the article and its two authors, one of whom won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting in 2016. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have published it if we hadn\u2019t felt comfortable with it,\u201d Ben Smith, the site\u2019s editor in chief, said in an interview. \u201cWe were careful and thorough.\u201dMr. Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House on Saturday, called the article \u201ca disgrace to our country.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a long time for the mainstream media to recover its credibility.\u201dThe episode underscored the risks and temptations that go with reporting on the legal labyrinth of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, the outcome of which may help determine the fate of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.BuzzFeed\u2019s findings were attributed to two unnamed federal law enforcement officers with knowledge of the special counsel\u2019s investigation. One of the reporters, Anthony Cormier, said on CNN that he had not reviewed the underlying documents, but that the two sources had, and they were \u201cfully, 100 percent read-in to that aspect of the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201dMr. Cormier and his co-writer, Jason Leopold, have written well-received investigative articles on Mr. Trump and a Moscow tower project that involved President Vladimir Putin of Russia. The latest piece, though, was more dramatic in reporting that Mr. Trump had instructed Mr. Cohen to lie to Congress about the Moscow project and that Mr. Mueller\u2019s office was aware of this conduct.The BuzzFeed article was the talk of TV pundits and news websites for 24 hours \u2014 until Peter Carr, Mr. Mueller\u2019s spokesman, weighed in. Mr. Carr, whose stoicism is so well-known in Washington that he has the nickname \u201cMr. No-Comment,\u201d wrote: \u201cBuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the special counsel\u2019s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s congressional testimony are not accurate.\u201dSeveral reporters who cover the Justice Department said they interpreted the statement as a full denial of BuzzFeed\u2019s conclusions. Mr. Smith, in the interview, said the wording of Mr. Carr\u2019s statement was imprecise, adding that he was \u201ceager to understand\u201d which specific aspects of the article the special counsel\u2019s office had denied. Asked if the statement had caught him by surprise, Mr. Smith replied, \u201cYou always have to be ready for everything in this business.\u201dBuzzFeed News, the reporting division of a website better known for viral videos and quizzes, has scrambled for respect and recognition since its founding eight years ago. Under the direction of Mr. Smith, a longtime political journalist, the site has pursued ambitious stories. Last year it was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for an inquiry into the deaths of Russians in England, which Mr. Leopold worked on.BuzzFeed\u2019s longtime investigative editor, Mark Schoofs, left in October for an academic post at the University of Southern California. His replacement, Heidi Blake, who is based in London, edited the Cohen piece, along with Mr. Smith and Ariel Kaminer, a senior investigations editor, both of whom are based in New York.This is not the site\u2019s first brush with controversy. In January 2017, Mr. Smith was the first editor to publish the explosive, but unverified, dossier compiled by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele during the 2016 campaign. Besides earning ire from the White House, and some scolding from media ethicists, the site was also sued for libel by Mr. Cohen in a case that was later dropped. Last month, a federal judge ruled in favor of BuzzFeed in a separate dossier-related lawsuit.Mr. Leopold, who is based in Los Angeles and known for his mastery of Freedom of Information laws, has a self-described \u201ccheckered past\u201d in journalism that includes retracted reporting and accusations of plagiarism. In 2006, he reported for TruthOut.org, a liberal website, that Karl Rove, a senior adviser to then-president George W. Bush, would soon be indicted; the story proved false. Mr. Leopold has also spoken openly about his recovery from addiction. Asked about Mr. Leopold\u2019s past, Mr. Smith pointed to his Pulitzer Prize nomination last year.The contentiousness over the recent BuzzFeed article is unlikely to abate soon.Its central assertion pleased many liberals impatient for Mr. Mueller to release his findings. Democratic lawmakers were quick to write on Twitter that, \u201cif true,\u201d the article\u2019s findings could lead to impeachment. In covering the reaction to its own scoop, BuzzFeed ran the headline, \u201cMore And More Democrats Are Suggesting Trump Should Be Impeached After He Told His Lawyer Michael Cohen To Lie To Congress.\u201dThe cold water of Mr. Carr\u2019s denial led some journalists to cringe on-air in real time. \u201cThis is a bad day for us,\u201d the CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on Friday, after his network had devoted many segments to dissecting the piece. \u201cIt reinforces every bad stereotype about the news media.\u201dThe president\u2019s son, Donald J. Trump Jr., a relentless media critic, responded in his own way, on Twitter: \u201cHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!\u201dOne side effect of the BuzzFeed article was that it made for a rare moment of agreement between the president and the man who has been investigating him.\u201cI appreciate the special counsel coming out with a statement,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday. \u201cI think it was very appropriate that they did so. I very much appreciate that.\u201d"}, {"title": "China\u2019s Slowdown Looms Just as the World Looks for Growth", "category": "Business", "id": "1b3fbdf3-9a41-49e7-8288-5c06bfc25368", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/business/china-economy-growth-davos.html", "publishdate": 20190120, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/21/business/21davos-econ1-print/merlin_146475984_d3920f50-5636-433b-a7aa-2bc59ede4937-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 In the vast metropolis of Chongqing in western China, three huge Ford Motor assembly plants have slowed to a fraction of their earlier pace.In the eastern province of Jiangsu, hundreds of chemical factories have closed.In Guangdong Province in the southeast, factories have idled workers in droves.China\u2019s huge economy, a major driver of global growth, is cooling just when the world needs its spark. On Monday, Chinese officials said that, during the last three months of 2018, the economy grew at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis. It is happening at a difficult time. The broader world outlook is beginning to dim. The American economy, which has powered ahead in recent years with strong growth and low unemployment, is showing some signs of a slowdown and is facing higher short-term interest rates that could act as a brake. Europe\u2019s resurgence is beginning to show its age, too, with even Germany\u2019s industrial engine starting to sputter.In the past, China has helped the world out of such weak spots, most notably during the global financial crisis. But this time, its economy is showing pronounced weakness.Car sales have plunged in China since last summer. Smartphone sales are falling. The real estate market has stagnated, with deeply indebted developers forced to pay steep interest rates to roll over their debts. And trade frictions with the West, coupled with tough policies from Beijing toward foreign investors, have made Chinese and foreign companies alike warier of further investment in China.\u201cEuropean investment in China is going down,\u201d Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European Union\u2019s commissioner of trade, said during an interview in Washington. \u201cThat is more because it is becoming increasingly complicated to do business there, with the forced technology transfer, with the lack of transparency, discrimination as compared to Chinese companies, with the massive subsidies of state-owned companies.\u201dFor the heads of state and corporate leaders gathering this week in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, the Chinese economy could be the most pressing issue, even among the trade fights and political uncertainty plaguing the rest of the world.China on Monday said its economy grew 6.4 percent during the last three months of 2018 compared with the same time in 2017. For all of 2018, China\u2019s economy grew 6.6 percent, the slowest pace since 1990, though many economists believe the country\u2019s headline figures are unreliable.Previous slowdowns in China, like the one in 2015 and 2016, unnerved investors and global business leaders alike, setting off worries that multinational companies would lose profits from their Chinese subsidiaries, or that Chinese companies would dump their surplus production on world markets at very low prices.Apple surprised markets this month when it warned of weaker-than-expected demand for its iPhones in China.

A disorderly British exit from the European Union or a financial crisis in debt-ridden Italy could also be unsettling. In the United States, the national debt is rising and the stimulus from large tax cuts may start to wear off by next year. The Federal Reserve could keep raising interest rates to keep inflation at bay, making it more expensive to borrow money, though it isn\u2019t clear exactly what the American central bank will do.Still, the big question now is, to paraphrase the line about Las Vegas: Will what happens in China stay in China, or will it become a global problem?The World Bank aptly titled its review of this year\u2019s outlook \u201cDarkening Prospects.\u201d It warned that China\u2019s slowdown could affect countries that export a great deal to it.China is the world\u2019s second-largest importer, after the United States. But the composition of its imports is unusual.It is the largest market for a long list of commodity exporters, from Australia to Uruguay, thanks to its voracious appetite for iron ore, food, energy and other raw materials it needs to keep its economy humming. China is also a large market for factory equipment made in countries like Germany and Japan. But its imports of manufactured goods overall are few for an economy of its size. That has limited the dependence of workers elsewhere, particularly in the United States, on the Chinese economy.The global impact of the Chinese slowdown now underway could be limited if Beijing decides to borrow and spend its way into more growth. Already this month, China has issued a series of announcements approving six municipal subway construction projects and three new intercity rail lines, at a combined cost of $148 billion. \u201cThe weaker the data gets, the more confident we get that they\u2019ll tip a lot of stimulus into keeping the economy moving,\u201d said Michael Blythe, the chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.Many of the biggest new construction projects are in China\u2019s western regions, said Wang Min, the chairman of Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, a state-owned giant. The projects have been good for his company, China\u2019s largest producer of huge earth-moving equipment, and its orders have soared in recent months.But linking together towns in sparsely populated areas of mountains and deserts is expensive. It adds large sums to China\u2019s already very high levels of debt. And the investment may produce scant new economic activity to pay off that extra debt.Previously accumulated debt lies at the heart of a one-two punch that has laid China\u2019s overall economy low in recent months.Vice Premier Liu He promised at Davos a year ago that China would rein in the growth of credit within three years. Chinese officials were confident at the time that they could head off a trade war with the United States.ImageChina\u2019s huge economy, a major driver of global growth, is cooling just when the world needs its spark. Data released by Beijing in recent months shows softer investment, unprofitable factories and consumers who are no longer so quick to open their wallets.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesThey set about putting stringent limits on the country\u2019s extensive shadow banking networks. Those networks had been providing a gusher of loans to the country\u2019s small and midsize enterprises, which China\u2019s big, state-owned banks have long neglected in favor of lending to state-owned enterprises.But by the end of April, as the economy started slowing, Chinese officials started to say that three years was not enough time. As credit dried up and many private sector businesses started running low on cash, top regulators expressed worry at a Shanghai financial conference in June that they might have already gone too far.At the same time, momentum was building in Beijing to extend the influence of the Communist Party and state-owned enterprises, mainly at the expense of the private sector. The private sector is responsible for most job creation in China, and the rhetoric from Beijing further scared investors.Less than a month after the Shanghai conference, the trade war began in earnest. President Trump imposed the first of three tranches of tariffs on imports from China. Corporate executives say that by the time the third tranche hit in late September, consumer confidence was crumbling. Purchases of big-ticket goods, especially cars, fell fast.Business confidence slumped as well. A survey of 270 importers in the United States conducted in late December and early January by Panjiva, a trade data service, found that 71 percent planned to change how and where they bought their goods if tariffs stayed unchanged. And 87 percent said they would do so if the Trump administration raised tariffs further.As companies start moving their supply chains, the main beneficiaries seem to be Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam and Indonesia. But to the extent that those countries buy more factory equipment from places like Germany, some of the negative effects overseas from weaker sales in China could be offset.Most economists are predicting that the first quarter of this year will be weak in China. Many are predicting that the second will be, too.But quite a few say they still have confidence in China\u2019s consistent, four-decade track record of pulling itself out of slumps quickly. Chinese officials have put new emphasis in recent weeks on rebuilding confidence. And they are at least trying to reassure private companies that the government will not favor state-owned enterprises over them.\u201cAs long as we can create a level playing field,\u201d said Ma Jiantang, a senior economic adviser to China\u2019s cabinet, \u201cprivate companies will surely succeed.\u201d"}, {"title": "Kamala Harris Declares Candidacy, Evoking King and Joining Diverse Field", "category": "Politics", "id": "611887d4-1fd3-4f22-8192-c76652b652ad", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-president.html", "publishdate": 20190121, "imageurl": "", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Kamala Harris, the California Democrat and barrier-breaking prosecutor who became the second black woman to serve in the United States Senate, declared her candidacy for president on Monday, joining an increasingly crowded and diverse field in what promises to be a wide-open nomination process.The choreography of the announcement carried abundant symbolism: Ms. Harris entered the race on the holiday of Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday, an overt nod to the historic nature of her candidacy. Her timing was also meant to evoke Shirley Chisholm, the New York congresswoman who became the first woman to seek the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination for president 47 years ago this week.In addition, Ms. Harris will hold her first campaign event on Friday in South Carolina, where black voters are the dominant force in the Democratic primary, rather than start off by visiting Iowa and New Hampshire, the two predominantly white states that hold their nomination contests first. She will hold a kickoff rally Sunday in Oakland, Calif., her hometown, and a town hall in Iowa later next week.\u201cThe core of my campaign is the people,\u201d Ms. Harris said at an afternoon news conference at Howard University, the historically black college she attended in the 1980s. \u201cNobody is living their life through the lens of one issue. And I think what people want is leadership that sees them through the complexity of their lives and pays equal attention to their needs. Let\u2019s not put people in a box.\u201dMs. Harris\u2019s campaign is already facing skepticism from some in the party\u2019s liberal wing, who believe she has lurched to the left only in recent years as preparation for a presidential campaign. She has repeatedly come under scrutiny from liberals for several \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d positions she took as a prosecutor in California, including defending the use of the death penalty as recently as 2015 and establishing a measure that sought to punish parents for chronically truant children.For the first time, the Democratic presidential race now includes several high-profile women, with Ms. Harris joining two other prominent senators, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Hawaii Democrat, has also said she is running, and more women could enter the race in the coming weeks.Ms. Harris made her announcement during a morning interview on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d She also released a video aimed at supporters and other Democrats, debuting a campaign slogan that played off her background as a prosecutor: \u201cKamala Harris For the People.\u201d\u201cThe future of our country depends on you, and millions of others, lifting our voices to fight for our American values,\u201d Ms. Harris said in the video. \u201cLet\u2019s do this together: For ourselves, for our children, for our country,\u201d she said.Her announcement kicked off a day of tribute and outreach to black voters by Democratic presidential candidates and potential candidates. Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Bernie Sanders of Vermont made appearances, as did Ms. Gillibrand, Ms. Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who expressed regret for supporting crime bills earlier in his career that have been criticized for disproportionately impacting black Americans.Ms. Harris\u2019s long-expected entry comes as many Democrats are eager to find new leaders and as the party grasps for a unifying message that can appeal to its increasingly progressive base and more moderate voters who have recoiled from President Trump.A 54-year-old former California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney, Ms. Harris is something of a bridge between the Democrats eyeing the race who are in their 70s, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, and those in their 40s, like Mr. Booker and former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke. Further, while she hails from one of the country\u2019s most famously liberal cities, she has ties to both the pragmatic and leftist wings of the party: She is rooted in the Bay Area\u2019s Democratic establishment but has embraced a more progressive agenda since being elected to the Senate in 2016.While other Democrats have focused their economic policy on regulating corporations or limiting the influence of Wall Street, Ms. Harris\u2019s signature proposal is more focused on individuals and would provide lower-income families with monthly cash payments of up to $500. She has also proposed a bail reform bill that\u2019s backed by several civil rights groups, and she focused her initial Senate work on curbing maternal death rates, particularly among black women.Like many Democrats, Ms. Harris has sought to align herself with the party\u2019s leftward drift in recent years, proclaiming her support for \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and, after an initial hesitation, disavowing most corporate donations. She has also embraced the legalization of recreational marijuana, a position she once rebuffed.[Who\u2019s in, who\u2019s ready to join? Follow the Democratic field with The Times\u2019s candidate tracker.]\u201cShe has long been a reform-minded prosecutor who struck a balance between the need for public safety and reckoning with civil rights ideals,\u201d said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.But not everyone agrees that Ms. Harris can easily assuage Democrats worried about her record as a prosecutor and district attorney.\u201cIf Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past,\u201d wrote Lara Bazelon, a law professor, in an opinion piece for The Times last week.Ms. Harris is still not yet well known to voters, but there is curiosity about her among the party rank-and-file as they face a Democratic nomination contest that is defined primarily by its uncertainty.Mr. Trump has thrust issues of race and identity to the forefront of the national debate, and with the Democratic coalition growing even more dependent on racial minorities, Ms. Harris \u2014 the daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother \u2014 would represent a history-making contrast in a general election against the president.As the first black woman in the Senate in over a decade, she garnered attention from her perch on key committees for her intensive interrogations of Trump administration officials and nominees, most famously during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing with former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\u201cDid you have communication with Russian businessmen or any Russian national? Are you aware of any communications?\u201d Ms. Harris asked Mr. Sessions during the tense exchange.\u201cYou let me qualify,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Sessions responded. \u201cIf I don\u2019t qualify, you accuse me of lying, so I need to be correct as best as I can. I\u2019m not able to be rushed this fast. It makes me nervous.\u201dMs. Harris focused her initial campaign message on broad themes of unity and revitalization, which emphasize her unique status as one of \u2014 if not the \u2014 most viable black women to ever run for president. Her announcement video borrows language from \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing,\u201d the song and poem written in 1900 and long referred to as America\u2019s \u201cblack national anthem.\u201dShe has been compared to former President Barack Obama, who also ran for president just two years after coming to the Senate. But unlike Mr. Obama, who became a political celebrity even before he arrived in Washington, Ms. Harris has made her name since being elected to Congress.\u201cWe can\u2019t have business as usual, and I like that she\u2019s not waiting her time \u2014 but she wants to make this time her own,\u201d said Aaron Jenkins, a 37-year-old who works in education policy and attended the National Action Network\u2019s breakfast honoring the King holiday on Monday.Her centrist standing in the party could also turn out to be an asset. Her campaign advisers, which include several people who helped shepherd her from San Francisco to Capitol Hill, believe she is well-suited to build coalitions within the Democratic electorate, because she is not tethered to a single faction.However, even before she formally entered the race, Ms. Harris was criticized by some in her own party.One of her top aides, Larry Wallace, resigned in December after revelations that he was involved in a harassment lawsuit and a $400,000 settlement while working for the California Department of Justice. Ms. Harris has said she did not know about the settlement, but she apologized and took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for hiring Mr. Wallace.Critics on Ms. Harris\u2019s left have also called her record into question, pointing to a dramatic increase in the state\u2019s prison population during her years in public office.\u201cKamala Harris is a cop\u201d goes one often-repeated criticism that floods the senator\u2019s social media accounts.\u201cThere were cases where folks who made a decision in my office and didn\u2019t consult me and I regret that,\u201d Ms. Harris said Monday when asked about some of her more controversial cases. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of what I did as a prosecutor that I\u2019m proud of.\u201dA Quinnipiac University poll in mid-December illustrated Ms. Harris\u2019s potential, finding her with a favorable rating among Democrats but with the majority of respondents still wanting \u201cto hear more.\u201d About 40 percent of Democrats had a favorable opinion of her, compared with just 4 percent who viewed her unfavorably.Ms. Harris, the first major candidate for president from California in over a quarter-century, could also benefit from changes to the 2020 nominating calendar.

Facebook is also a subject of several investigations by the data protection authorities in Europe.The ruling signals a new phase in enforcing the European law, which the region\u2019s lawmakers and privacy groups have cheered as a check against the growing power of technology companies, while for general consumers it has led mostly to a frustrating increase in the number of consent boxes to click. The fine against Google is just the fourth penalty against any company since the law took effect.Europe\u2019s experience is being closely watched by policymakers in the United States, who are considering a new federal privacy law. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive officer, last week called for new rules that closely follow Europe\u2019s.Europe has become the world\u2019s most aggressive tech watchdog. In addition to the privacy rules, the region\u2019s regulators have set the bar with stricter enforcement of antitrust laws against Google and other tech behemoths and taken a tougher stance against the industry\u2019s tax policies. Google, a frequent target, was fined a record \u20ac4.3 billion last year for abusing its power in the mobile phone market.The ruling on Monday takes aim at Google\u2019s business model, which turns data on users into narrowly targeted ads.A central element of Europe\u2019s new regulations is that companies must clearly explain how data is collected and used. France\u2019s data protection regulator, known as CNIL, said Google did not go far enough to get consent from users before processing data. Instead, it said, people are largely unaware of the data they are agreeing to share, or how Google plans to use the information.In a statement, the regulator said Google\u2019s practices obscured how its services \u201ccan reveal important parts of their private life since they are based on a huge amount of data, a wide variety of services and almost unlimited possible combinations.\u201dGoogle\u2019s size \u2014 it has about 20 different services \u2014 makes its data-collection practices \u201cparticularly massive and intrusive,\u201d the French authorities said.Google defended its policies and said it was determining whether to appeal.\u201cPeople expect high standards of transparency and control from us,\u201d a Google spokesman said. \u201cWe\u2019re deeply committed to meeting those expectations and the consent requirements of the G.D.P.R. We\u2019re studying the decision to determine our next steps.\u201dThe case against Google stemmed from a complaint filed by privacy groups that accused the search giant of not properly adjusting its data-collection practices to account for Europe\u2019s stricter privacy rules.\u201cA lot of U.S. companies have dumped everything they do in a consent box and have people waive their rights,\u201d said Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer who founded NOYB, one of the groups that filed the complaint, and is a longtime antagonist of American tech giants over data collection.\u201cNo one who reads it understands,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they do with my data, and I\u2019m a lawyer.\u201dRapha\u00ebl Dana, a partner at the Paris law firm Frieh Associ\u00e9s who specializes in privacy law, said Silicon Valley companies should expect more penalties across Europe as a result of the data protection law.\u201cThis is going to change the perspective between the profits that internet companies are able to make from the data of users, and the risk of being sanctioned with fines,\u201d Mr. Dana said.The fine announced on Monday is far lower than the maximum penalty under the European privacy law, which is 4 percent of global revenue. For Google, that would be more than $4 billion.\u201cThe fine is immaterial,\u201d said Johnny Ryan, the chief policy and industry relations officer at the web browser Brave. \u201cBut CNIL\u2019s decision is very significant because it means that Google must stop building advertising profiles about people until it has properly told them what it is doing and received their consent.\u201dMr. Ryan said the risk to Google was that people would be startled to see how their data was used.\u201cIt is likely that many people will say no to being profiled by Google when they learn the truth,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "China Transforms, and a Factory Owner Struggles to Follow", "category": "Business", "id": "366260db-89f5-467c-88bf-66662621652b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/technology/china-economy-manufacturing-labor-costs.html", "publishdate": 20190121, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/22/business/22newworld-1/merlin_143747235_c52e3fac-66b7-44fd-9c69-defc55d23dd0-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Shao Chunyou exemplifies the Chinese dream. Over three decades, he rose from an assembly line worker to an electronics business owner, following China\u2019s rise from an economic backwater to the world\u2019s No. 2 economy. He now owns two factories and employs over 2,000 workers.Now, as China changes, Mr. Shao must reinvent himself again.Fast growth is fading. Competition has intensified. And in a country sometimes called the world\u2019s factory floor, it sometimes seems as if nobody wants to work in a factory anymore.\u201cThere were more workers and fewer factories then,\u201d Mr. Shao said, referring to the old days. \u201cNow we have to beg workers.\u201dChina\u2019s economy is slowing, yes, and government policies have made business tougher for many. But there are bigger, broader forces at work challenging the entrepreneurs like Mr. Shao who lifted China out of poverty.China has moved up the value chain, and its people have moved up along with it. They want higher wages and a better life. China is no longer the world\u2019s cheap factory. The country must now embrace high-value manufacturing, automation and innovation if it hopes to keep growing at a steady clip. Success depends on the ability of people like Mr. Shao to pivot away from their traditional business methods.Mr. Shao\u2019s pivot won\u2019t be easy or cheap. He is replacing people with robots. He is making more sophisticated gadgets that could flummox copycats but could also be disastrously expensive if they fail. And in a shift for a businessman who prides himself on doing it alone, he is for the first time accepting direct government help. \u201cDoing business is like releasing the arrow from a bow,\u201d said Yu Youfu, Mr. Shao\u2019s wife. \u201cOnce it\u2019s in motion, there\u2019s no way to turn it back.\u201dImageMr. Shao's company, Quankang, is working with Xiaomi to design and make smart home appliances such as space heaters and electric fans. CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesEverybody calls Mr. Shao \u201cboss,\u201d even his wife. A portly man with a poof of hair that invites comparison to the American president\u2019s, Mr. Shao owns an electronics company called Quankang. Ms. Yu, a slender, intense woman, oversees factory operations, finance and administration. Their 27-year-old son, Shao Qiang, heads Quankang\u2019s new research and development department. The company traditionally made parts for smartphones and other gadgets, though it is now setting its sights higher. The family is defined by its factories. For years, the couple slept in their office next to the factory, and Ms. Yu still crashes there from time to time even though their spacious apartment is a 15-minute drive away.\u201cI sleep better with the noise of the machines,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re noisy, it means they\u2019re functioning.\u201dMr. Shao was born in Jiujiang, a medium-size city in China\u2019s interior. At 16, he became an apprentice carpenter, making roughly 60 cents a day, barely enough to feed himself.In 1989, the same year the authorities gunned down protesters in Tiananmen Square, Mr. Shao, then 20, went south. Deng Xiaoping, then China\u2019s paramount leader, had opened special economic zones \u2014 essentially areas where entrepreneurs could start businesses and court foreign investors \u2014 in southern cities like Shenzhen and Zhuhai. The newly built factories there were hiring.Mr. Shao left home with about $5 in his pocket. Highways and high-speed trains didn\u2019t crisscross China as they do now. He had to take a one-hour bus ride to the provincial capital, then a 15-hour train ride.\u201cThe trains were always packed, like the ones shipping pigs,\u201d he said.It wasn\u2019t easy to find a job, without which Mr. Shao couldn\u2019t get permission to live in Shenzhen. Whenever the authorities raided dormitories looking for trespassers, he and others would hide overnight in a nearby cemetery.He finally found a job as an apprentice, making much less than $1 a day. Working overtime earned him a few cents more per hour. Within three years, he was promoted to supervisor and was making roughly $375 a month. Ms. Yu, also from Jiujiang, joined him in Shenzhen with Shao Qiang, then 2 months old. \u201cI would work from 8 a.m. till 11 p.m. or even midnight.\u201d Mr. Shao said. \u201cWe all wanted to earn the overtime pay. Nobody complained.\u201dImageWorkers eating lunch in the factory canteen. Like most factory owners, Mr. Shao provides Quankang workers with housing and meals.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesIn 2004, Mr. Shao started a small metal-molding company while working at his day job. Ms. Yu dealt with clients and managed the books. They called the company Quankang, which can mean \u201call healthy\u201d or \u201call good.\u201d They sent their son back home to be raised by his grandparents, as many migrant workers in China had done. Two years later, they moved from Shenzhen to neighboring Dongguan, a city of cheap factory buildings.Government and state-owned banks typically didn\u2019t help small business owners like Mr. Shao and Ms. Yu, and they struggled at first. They once turned away a big customer because they didn\u2019t have the cash to buy the materials. To win over another customer, they rented a huge metalworking machine and moved it into their factory overnight to show the client who visited in the morning that they could do the work. They got the order.They started by making metal parts for MP3 players, then cellphone casings. They spent $13,000 of their savings on a polishing machine, a fortune for most Chinese at the time.\u201cMy heart was filled with trepidation,\u201d Mr. Shao said. \u201cIf we failed, we would lose everything.\u201dThey didn\u2019t fail. Helped by China\u2019s surging growth, they became part of a vast web of suppliers that has helped China dominate the business of manufacturing electronics. But as China began to mature, business got tougher. Competitors emerged. Pricing became brutal. Mr. Shao and Ms. Yu found they had to evolve or die.In 2015, the couple started working with Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi and Huawei to make key metal parts for their headsets as smartphone sales took off. They took out millions of dollars in bank loans and invested in 120 tooling machines. The bet paid off until the competition became too fierce that they began considering harder-to-replicate products, such as appliances.\u201cIn China, once you have a product that sells well, many companies will rush in to make the same thing,\u201d Mr. Shao said.The biggest problem the couple and many other Chinese manufacturers face is the growing cost of labor and increasingly scarce workers.Mr. Shao and Ms. Yu paid their workers about 1,000 renminbi a month in 2004, or about $150 at current exchange rates. Now pay is at least five times that, and can go as high as eight times that.Like most factories Quankang also provides housing and meals. It used to pay four types of social benefits. Now it pays six. The couple know they are lucky to have survived. After the financial crisis, many multinational manufacturers in Dongguan moved their factories to lower-cost countries like Vietnam. Many of the couple\u2019s friends and competitors closed their factories.Over lunch recently, Ms. Yu shook her head as she told her husband that a nearby electronic component factory that hired 7,000 workers at its peak had just filed for bankruptcy. In 2017, they came up with an ambitious survival plan: Move, climb the value chain and automate.ImageWorkers walking to their dorm rooms at the Shao family's factory in Dongguan.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesQuankang is working with Xiaomi to design and make smart home appliances such as space heaters and electric fans. Mr. Shao and Ms. Yu plan to build three fully automated assembly lines. The first is expected to be running by March. And for the first time, Quankang is accepting direct government support. Mr. Shao\u2019s modernization campaign will happen on more than 30 acres far away from Dongguan, in neighboring Hunan Province. The local government there is giving Quankang the land almost free of charge. The local government of Yanling County is more interested in tax revenue and job creation than revenue from land sales, Mr. Shao said. So far, he has spent nearly $12 million on the Hunan plant.China\u2019s boom started when the Communist Party unleashed the country\u2019s entrepreneurs and largely left them alone. This next stage of growth may not be so easy. To help it along, the central government is spending vast amounts to upgrade manufacturing. Local officials in less developed provinces are trying to lure companies to replicate southern China\u2019s economic miracle. It proves appealing to entrepreneurs like Mr. Shao and Ms. Yu, who are desperate to find a new niche to survive and thrive. \u201cThe business of our factories isn\u2019t as good as before,\u201d Ms. Yu said. \u201cBut since we\u2019ve been doing this, we\u2019ll keep charging ahead because behind us it\u2019s a precipice. We\u2019ll fall if we step back.\u201d"}, {"title": "Fracking Wasn\u2019t Supposed to Cause Quakes in U.K. But Then the Ground Shook.", "category": "Business", "id": "a7260be2-8144-497e-95c5-ba0b89ac9d5e", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/business/energy-environment/fracking-britain-cuadrilla-resources.html", "publishdate": 20190121, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/business/00fracking-1/00fracking-1-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LONDON \u2014 Last fall an energy company began a hydraulic fracturing operation in northwest England that it hoped would be a milestone in creating a new, domestic source of natural gas for Britain \u2014 in much the same way that fracking has taken hold in the United States.Three months later, after regularly causing earthquakes, the fracking has stopped, and the company has begun pulling some equipment from the site.The company, Cuadrilla Resources, says it will continue to work in the cow pasture near Blackpool in Lancashire, seeking to extract natural gas economically and safely from the shale rocks. But so far, its results have failed to win over skeptics.Some gas has bubbled up through the fracking liquids in its well, demonstrating that the rock formation Cuadrilla was exploring, known as the Bowland Shale, indeed contains some fuel. But the company was forced to suspend fracking at least four times when the work led to earthquakes that exceeded a magnitude of 0.5, the upper limit set by British regulators. There were also many smaller tremors.This stop-and-go added to the company\u2019s costs while doing little in Britain to improve the public image of fracking, which involves injecting special fluids under high pressure to free up gas trapped in shale rock. Cuadrilla is also running behind its original schedule: The company indicated in October that it planned to drill and frack two wells in three months, but has so far fracked just one.\u201cIt\u2019s not gone very well,\u201d said Peter Styles, an emeritus professor of geophysics at Keele University, who has advised the British government and industry on fracking and seismic matters. \u201cThey\u2019ve probably lost the public argument.\u201dWith fracking halted, trucks have been taking pumps and other heavy fracking gear off the site, leading to local speculation that Cuadrilla might be throwing in the towel, something that the company denies.ImageCuadrilla began the fracking in a cow pasture in Lancashire in northwest England in mid-October after battling opponents in court. The idea was to test whether natural gas could be produced economically and safely from the shale rocks beneath the soil.CreditAndrew Testa for The New York TimesCuadrilla said in an email that it was shifting its focus from fracking to testing how much gas can be coaxed from the well. Such flow rates are important in determining whether shale gas drilling is commercially viable. The company said it was returning equipment that was not needed for this purpose. Cuadrilla is owned by a Wall Street investment firm, Riverstone Holdings, and an Australian drilling services company, AJ Lucas.At the same time, the company has been lobbying the government to lift the limits on earth tremors so it can speed up the fracking process and, possibly, permit more powerful pumping.\u201cWe would like to see our data and experience considered as a starting point to revisit the limits, whilst ensuring public safety and confidence is maintained,\u201d the company said in its email.In October, Francis Egan, Cuadrilla\u2019s chief executive, used stronger language, warning in an interview with The Financial Times that the fracking industry \u201ccould be strangled at birth\u201d unless rules were eased. Frackers in the United States have also encountered earthquake problems, though the thresholds in North America for stopping work are typically greater than magnitude 2.0, wrote F. Todd Davidson, a research associate at the Energy Institute of the University of Texas at Austin, in an email.Other companies pursuing shale in Britain, like Igas Energy and Ineos, a large petrochemical company with shale interests, have also called for a review of the rules.The government has rejected any appeals to loosen its regulations. On Nov. 2, in a letter obtained by Greenpeace, Claire Perry, the minister of state for clean growth and energy, wrote to Mr. Egan that \u201cthe government believes the current system is fit for purpose and has no intention of altering it.\u201dMs. Perry also noted that Cuadrilla\u2019s fracturing plan was \u201cdeveloped and reviewed over several months with reference to existing regulations\u201d and that \u201cat no point did you communicate that it would not be possible to proceed without a change in regulations.\u201dThe tremors have not posed a threat to life or property, according to experts. The British Geological Survey, a research organization that had placed monitors around Cuadrilla\u2019s fracking site, reported that only two of the tremors \u2014 including the largest one, on Dec. 11, which registered magnitude 1.5 \u2014 were felt by residents in the area.ImagePolice officers stopped anti-fracking protesters last year in Blackpool, England. The demonstrators had sought to block a tanker truck from leaving a drilling site.CreditChristopher Furlong/Getty Images\u201cAll of the events have been extremely small,\u201d said Brian Baptie, one of the organization\u2019s seismologists. \u201cThe regulations are doing their job\u201d in preventing earthquakes that might disturb the public, he said.Mr. Baptie said that the British rules had been set at \u201cvery, very conservative\u201d levels. As more data becomes available, he said, there could be \u201cscope\u201d for modifying the thresholds to perhaps a limit of 1.0. He warned, though, that increasing the amounts of liquids injected might also increase the probability of larger seismic events. In western Canada, for instance, fracking was blamed for a substantial 4.8-magnitude earthquake in 2016.Still, the fact that any tremors were recorded may prove a setback for the industry. \u201cIt has demonstrated quite clearly that they cannot undertake the fracking process without causing earthquakes,\u201d said Miranda Cox, a local councilor in Kirkham, which is about three miles from the site, and an opponent of fracking.Studies have shown that Britain has substantial natural gas resources embedded in shale rock, but Cuadrilla\u2019s recent experiment appears to leave both the government and the industry with few attractive options. For the government, fracking offers the potential to enhance Britain\u2019s energy security by providing an alternative to imported fuel, but it will be reluctant to be seen easing regulations in a way that increases risks.For the handful of active shale companies, progress has been slow, stymied by a lengthy regulatory process and opposition from environmentalists and local residents who worry about earthquakes and groundwater pollution. Those living near potential drilling sites also do not want their lives disrupted by the large volumes of truck traffic that drilling and fracking a well require.In Lancashire, a small but determined band of protesters has monitored and occasionally obstructed drilling. According to the Lancashire police, about 100 officers were involved in patrolling the Cuadrilla site from January 2017 through September 2018 with cumulative costs exceeding 9 million pounds.In an interview in October before drilling began, Mr. Egan, Cuadrilla\u2019s chief executive, suggested that the protests and other obstacles might melt away once the industry gained traction.That seems unlikely to happen soon given the recent experience.Richard Taylor, an oil and gas analyst at Fitch Solutions, a market research firm, said the tremors had \u201cdone no favors\u201d for the fledgling industry.\u201cIt reaffirms our long-term view that production from shale gas in the U.K. at a commercial stage is very much a distant prospect,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "On King Holiday, Democrats Convey Hope, Remorse and Invective Against Trump", "category": "Politics", "id": "d225f70c-dd6c-4219-a388-887901b28a8a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/biden-crime-bill-regrets.html", "publishdate": 20190121, "imageurl": "", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The commemoration of Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday on Monday became a day of confession, invective and promise for prominent Democrats, who used events across the country honoring the slain civil rights leader to try to inoculate themselves from criticism, lash out at President Trump as a racist and, in one case, begin a history-making run for the White House.From the nation\u2019s capital to the South Carolina Statehouse to the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s storefront headquarters in Harlem, the gatherings were solemn, spirited and reflected the fraught nature of what would have been the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s 90th year.They also reflected the political imperative of reaching out to black voters, who are a crucial part of the Democratic coalition and are increasingly demanding accountability on race from their own leaders.Speaking at a breakfast in Washington, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who was first elected to public office the year after Dr. King\u2019s assassination, acknowledged that more was expected of him at this moment.Mr. Biden said he regretted supporting the tough-on-crime drug legislation of the 1980s and 1990s, expressing remorse in particular over a bill that created different legal standards for powdered cocaine and street crack cocaine.\u201cIt was a big mistake that was made,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the measure, which has been criticized as disproportionately affecting black Americans. \u201cWe were told by the experts that \u2018crack, you never go back,\u2019 that the two were somehow fundamentally different. It\u2019s not. But it\u2019s trapped an entire generation.\u201dThe former senator, who helped write the 1994 crime bill now cited as having led to an era of mass incarceration, went even further, allowing that he \u201cmay not have always gotten things right\u201d in regards to criminal justice.Mr. Biden\u2019s remarks, at an event hosted by Mr. Sharpton, served as a pre-emptory move to head off criticism of his past policy decisions and made clear that he is both seriously considering a presidential bid and recognizes the hurdles he would face from his increasingly progressive party.But he was not the only potential White House contender in attendance at Washington\u2019s Mayflower Hotel with a record on criminal justice issues that leaves some African-Americans uneasy.Former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg also spoke, but he avoided any mention of the controversial policing tactic he supported in New York called \u201cstop-and-frisk,\u201d which gave police officers sweeping powers to detain \u2014 and sometimes harass \u2014 those suspected of committing crimes, particularly in neighborhoods with predominately nonwhite residents.Mr. Bloomberg did discuss a series of events that had shaped his recent thinking about race. In one example, he said he had recently learned about the deadly race riots in which white residents destroyed the Greenwood district of Tulsa, Okla., in 1921 and murdered several dozen black residents.ImageMichael R. Bloomberg avoided any mention Monday of the controversial policing tactic he supported in New York called \u201cstop-and-frisk.\u201dCreditTom Brenner for The New York Times\u201cIt\u2019s up to us to bring these stories out of the shadows so that they never happen again,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to erase history, we need to face up to history.\u201dSeveral audience members said they appreciated how Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Biden spoke to Dr. King\u2019s legacy and the issues of civil rights. But it was not difficult to find skepticism in the audience about whether they will be able to reckon with their past policies.\u201cIt all just sounds like 2020 is getting closer,\u201d quipped Christian Taylor, a 29-year-old consultant who attended the breakfast.In South Carolina, where the 2015 mass killing by a white supremacist prompted the state\u2019s governor to remove the Confederate battle flag from the statehouse grounds, about a thousand people gathered in Columbia for a rally that has become a marquee event on the political calendar of a crucial early nominating state.Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, both likely presidential candidates, spoke to the attendees after attending an early-morning prayer service and marching with N.A.A.C.P. leaders to the capitol. It is an annual rite that began in 2000 as a protest of the flag that once flew above the statehouse dome.The day was drenched in history. The church that hosted the service, Zion Baptist, was poised to host Dr. King in the spring of 1968, but he postponed a trip there to remain with striking sanitation workers in Memphis, where he was assassinated.When the procession arrived at the capitol on Monday, a handful of speakers were blaring Dr. King\u2019s oratory from the foot of a monument to Confederate soldiers, the last site of the Confederate banner.The two senators used their remarks to hail Dr. King, each in a way that foreshadowed their likely campaign messages.Mr. Booker summoned the pastor\u2019s words and those of other African-American icons to challenge the mostly black crowd to emulate Dr. King\u2019s determination. \u201cWhat is important is that we apply the ideals of Martin Luther King,\u201d said the senator, adding: \u201cOur dissatisfaction has to turn in action.\u201dBut he also warned against using vitriol toward political adversaries.Mr. Sanders sought to link his signature call for \u201ca political revolution\u201d with the life of Dr. King.\u201cKing had a revolutionary spirit, yes, he was a revolutionary,\u201d Mr. Sanders said before outlining an array of racial justice proposals that demonstrated both his leftist politics and how eager he is to improve his performance with black voters from 2016.

And she sought to highlight her history-making potential, airing a video that echoed \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing,\u201d the so-called black national anthem, and addressing reporters at Howard University, the storied historically black college from which she graduated.While Ms. Harris\u2019s candidacy carried promise to some Democrats, the current president was more on the minds of others in the party, and it produced some of the fiercest language of the day. With his divisive language and policies, Mr. Trump regularly invites accusations of bigotry.\u201cIt gives me no pleasure to tell you that we now have a president of the United States who is a racist,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in his remarks, drawing applause from a crowd that preferred to call Mr. Trump \u201c45\u201d than mention his name.At Mr. Sharpton\u2019s headquarters in Harlem, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the fourth-ranking House Democrat, was just as blunt.\u201cWe have a hater in the White House,\u201d said Mr. Jeffries. \u201cThe birther-in-chief. The grand wizard of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. One of the things we\u2019ve learned is that while Jim Crow may be dead, he\u2019s still got some nieces and nephews that are alive and well.\u201dHis remarks were met with some surprise and much cheering from the teeming 145th Street gathering of the National Action Network.For his part, Mr. Trump, joined by Vice President Mike Pence, made a surprise appearance at the monument to Dr. King in Washington. The president laid a wreath at the memorial but only stayed briefly and said nothing about the man being honored.\u201cGreat day, beautiful day,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters.But at events across the country, Democrats scorned the president for the government shutdown and linked it to what they described as his racism.\u201cAs we speak, our government is shut down for one reason: So that the president of the United States can fund a monument to hate and division along our southern border,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another 2020 candidate, said at a breakfast held in memory of Dr. King in Boston.Ms. Warren, like the other Democrats eying the White House, has tailored her rhetoric to appeal to an increasingly diverse and progressive party base that expects concrete and uncompromising plans for pursuing racial justice.Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who has acknowledged significantly shifting her views since serving as a centrist member of the House, said at the gathering in Harlem that the fight to redeem Dr. King \u201cwill take all of us.\u201d\u201cIt is wrong to ask men and women of color to bear these burdens every single day, the same fights over and over again,\u201d said Ms. Gillibrand, who announced her presidential bid last week. \u201cWhite women like me must bear part of this burden and commit to amplify your voices.\u201d"}, {"title": "On Politics: Democrats Reject Trump\u2019s Deal on Dreamers", "category": "Politics", "id": "04bcac78-8124-4491-9641-19694046d2b7", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/us/politics/democrats-trump-dreamers-deal.html", "publishdate": 20190121, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Monday morning.

If history is any indication, it won\u2019t be an easy task.\u2022 Last week, a group of House freshmen in Trump-leaning districts convened a private strategy session to discuss how they could press Ms. Pelosi to reclaim the issue of border security for Democrats.\u2022 As the longest government shutdown in American history continues, federal workers who are not getting paid are increasingly turning to pawnbrokers for short-term loans.\u2022 Those who have been watching Mr. Trump in the business world for decades see a familiar pattern in how he governs: He cares most about declaring himself a winner, and his opponent a loser.\u2022 Mr. Trump was involved in discussions to build a skyscraper in Moscow throughout the entire 2016 presidential campaign, his personal lawyer said on Sunday, a longer and more significant role for Mr. Trump than he had previously acknowledged.\u2022 Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s potential 2020 run has some Democrats worried about his go-it-alone streak.

For the last three months of 2018, growth came in at 6.4 percent compared with a year earlier. That\u2019s the slowest pace since a decade ago, when China was grappling with the global financial crisis.For the full year, according to official data, the Chinese economy grew 6.6 percent. That\u2019s the weakest pace of growth since 1990, when China\u2019s economic miracle stumbled in the aftermath of the crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square the year before.As slowdowns go, the numbers indicate a mild one befitting a big, maturing economy like China\u2019s. While the figures match historic lows, they show only a small drop from previous periods.Monthly data released on Monday also suggested better-than-expected consumer spending and industrial production in December, raising the possibility that growth is stabilizing.More detailed data tell a less positive story.From investment to consumer spending to factory activity, the Chinese economy slowed markedly in the second half of the year. The figures also indicate that the trade war with the United States is taking more of a bite.Moreover, the December uptick comes in large part from Beijing\u2019s efforts to get growth going again. While China\u2019s leaders have quite a few ways to juice growth if their current efforts aren\u2019t enough, their options often come with tricky trade-offs that could add to the country\u2019s debt problems or add to other imbalances plaguing the economy.China\u2019s slowdown is one of many reasons that the world economy is gradually decelerating. At a briefing on Monday afternoon at the start of the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the International Monetary Fund said that Germany, Italy, Mexico and Turkey each face slower growth in the year ahead than previously expected, for a variety of reasons particular to each country.\u201cThe world economy is growing more slowly than expected, and risks are rising,\u201d said Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F. \u201cDoes that mean that a global recession is around the corner? No. But the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased.\u201dImageA shopper at a Beijing mall last week. Retail sales continued to slow in December.CreditNicolas Asfouri/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images By the NumbersBeijing took steps to rekindle growth at the end of last year, and it showed. Retail sales and industrial output ticked up in December from November, suggesting consumers and businesses alike were feeling a little better as the year came to an end.But those monthly figures could not fully make up for a lackluster performance in the second half of the year. Retail sales slowed markedly during those last six months, weighted by a steep tumble in activity at China\u2019s car dealerships and broad weakness in smartphone sales. Investment in fixed assets like new factories and office buildings was anemic.\u201cChina\u2019s economy has slowed significantly in recent months,\u201d said Louis Kuijs, a China specialist at Oxford Economics, a large consulting firm.More broadly, many economists have estimated that China\u2019s slowdown is worse than the government\u2019s figures show, citing more detailed data. Some economists estimate growth is just a fraction of the headline figure, though most economists who crunch the figures say the number is only a percentage point or two lower.The question now is whether an improvement in December will carry over to the start of 2019. Despite the positive signs, China just two weeks ago decided to pump tens of billions of dollars into the financial system, suggesting that it sees a recovery as fragile at best.Trade TroubleChina\u2019s economic problems began before Mr. Trump began imposing tariffs on Chinese-made goods. That said, the trade war is not helping.Activity has also slowed lately at many export-oriented factories. Many rushed to ship goods to the United States before a feared increase in tariffs on Jan. 1 that did not end up happening, filling warehouses with surplus goods. Many Chinese factories have eliminated overtime and looked for other ways to trim employment costs.Economists at J.P. Morgan, the investment bank, on Monday slightly reduced their growth expectations for the first three months of the year, citing weaker-than-expected December trade figures.\u201cManufacturing has sunk from buoy to anchor over the past two quarters,\u201d the China Beige Book, an economic consulting firm, concluded in an analysis last month.ImageA production line for Volkswagen Tayron cars at the FAW-Volkswagen Tianjin Plant last month. A sharp fall in auto sales is one of the biggest factors in China\u2019s slowdown.CreditChina Network/ReutersDriving the SlowdownSome economists note that the biggest factor driving the weakness in retail sales in China, which by some estimates has accounted for half or more of the entire slowdown, is a sharp fall in auto sales.Auto sales have been falling since summer, with sales in December down a precipitous 19 percent from a year earlier. But China had a modest tax break for car buyers in 2016 that became smaller in 2017 and then disappeared entirely last year. Those tax policies may have pulled ahead some demand to 2016 and 2017, leaving the market poised for a drop last year.\u201cIt is because we had a high number in 2017 that the 2018 market has so much pressure,\u201d Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Cars Association, said in a phone interview.Sliding sales at car dealerships prompted a wave of production cuts at assembly plants across China. That in turn cut into demand for auto parts, steel, glass and other materials.But help may be on the way. Lian Weiliang, the vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a news conference last week that China would draft policies to \u201cstabilize\u201d consumption of cars and household appliances.How Long Will It Last?The Chinese government has allowed big-ticket projects, like new subway lines in many cities, to move forward, and it has pumped more money into the financial system. China\u2019s leaders have also pledged to cut taxes to shore up sagging business sentiment.The efforts \u201cwill boost the economy in the second half of this year,\u201d said Shen Jianguang, the chief economist at JD.com, a big Chinese online retailer.One big option that China still has: help the housing market.Building and outfitting homes and other buildings represents as much as a quarter of the country\u2019s economic activity by some estimates. China could take measures like loosening limits on mortgage lending and easing the ability of property developers to buy land and deal with their debt. But that approach comes with dangers. The sector is already overbuilt and plagued with speculation, something the Chinese authorities have long tried to contain.\u201cProperty easing will be used as a last resort, not a priority,\u201d said Tao Wang, a China economist at the Swiss bank UBS."}, {"title": "These Days, \u2018You Practically Need a Ph.D.\u2019 to Figure Out Frequent-Flier Status", "category": "Business", "id": "f7c594aa-fdd9-429c-b233-f06e41c145f9", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/business/airlines-frequent-flier-miles-travel.html", "publishdate": 20190121, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/15/business/15ITINERARIES-01/merlin_148999452_5d2fcd77-71cb-4fbf-9597-67a8bd256873-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The airlines\u2019 most valuable customers, those who fly most often and spend the most money, receive the sorts of benefits that most travelers can only salivate over \u2014 lounge access, free checked luggage, free upgrades, free itinerary changes.But most travelers aren\u2019t constantly flying, and they will find that the airlines have made it a lot more complicated to qualify even for a piece of that good life. \u201cYou practically need a Ph.D.\u201d to understand and compare all the complex rules among the different airlines, said Jamie Larounis of the travel blog The Forward Cabin.Three of the major airlines in the United States, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, each have four frequent-flier status levels and different formulas to compute the tiers. Alaska Airlines has three tiers and Southwest Airlines two; JetBlue has one. In the past few years most airlines have added spending requirements to their frequent-flier programs.Customers seeking elite status first need to understand that not all miles flown and dollars spent are equal. There are \u201cqualifying\u201d miles and dollars (sometimes called elite qualifying, medallion qualifying or premier qualifying). Those count toward achieving status with the airline. Other miles and dollars can be redeemed for flights or other items but do not help the flier get the top benefits. To figure out which miles and dollars qualify for status, travelers often have to read the fine print on airline websites.A flier who has attained MVP status \u2014 the lowest frequent-flier status \u2014 on Alaska earns, for example, 50 percent bonus miles on flights they take. Those miles can be used only to redeem tickets or other items; they do not count toward achieving next year\u2019s MVP status. The same fliers earn bonus miles if their ticket is booked in one of six of the 15 fare classes that grant bonuses. These miles do qualify toward elite status.Then, there are the flights on the airlines\u2019 partner carriers. Flights on partner airlines offer miles, but fliers may need more of them to achieve status. The Alaska flier needs to fly 20,000 miles on Alaska to achieve MVP status, but 25,000 miles if some miles were earned on partner airlines. Alaska Airlines offered a post on its website this month with tips for fliers hoping to earn status.Alaska does not require spending minimums, but for those airlines that do, money spent on a plane ticket will usually go toward elite status; spending on things other than flights using an airline credit card will usually not qualify. Flights booked with a partner airline may earn qualifying miles but not dollars, or follow some kind of percentage formula for credit.There are quirks throughout the complex system. For example, the lowest-fare ticket class, Basic Economy, may be counted as only half the miles flown or half a segment flown. Spending on airline credit cards may not generally count toward elite status spending requirements, but a customer may be granted a waiver if a certain high spending threshold is reached. Each airline has its own set of rules and formulas, and all make changes from time to time.And some airlines will try to attract valuable passengers away from competitors by offering to match the passenger\u2019s elite flying status with their own. The flier must then meet the flying and spending requirements of the new airline within a certain period to maintain that status.It all adds up to a daunting set of rules for frequent-flier programs. As Gary Leff, creator of the travel blog View From the Wing, put it, airline customers need to believe that it\u2019s worth spending the time to wade through the rules and plan their travel in a way that benefits them.Travelers should keep in mind, Mr. Leff said, that the airline programs have become less rewarding. Tickets cost more to redeem, and because flights are fuller, they are harder to redeem, he said.The airlines do not release figures on the number of frequent fliers. But Mr. Leff said he believed that the number of elite status fliers had actually increased from a decade ago. That\u2019s because more people are flying more miles now, he said, and because airline mergers have made it easier to concentrate trips on one brand.Those who attain elite status can get hooked on the benefits. Andrea Umbach, an executive coach in Seattle, found that her Alaska status meant she could change or cancel an Alaska ticket without a fee.\u201cI could book a trip to a client meeting or conference far enough in advance to get a good price, but could change it without spending a lot if my plans changed,\u201d she said. That helps her manage her business expenses.Ms. Umbach is spending January looking at her plans for travel this year with an eye on retaining her MVP Gold frequent-flier status \u2014 the second level of status. She plans to check in on her progress periodically and make extra flights at the end of the year if she needs to.For those who like to plan ahead, January is a good time to read airline and credit card website details and think about the next 12 months of travel, Mr. Leff said. Travelers should look at airlines\u2019 schedules and destinations, and the benefits offered at each elite flier level. Then, he said, they should approximate the travel they will do and see what status levels they can achieve.If a traveler wants to take a long flight, mainly just to earn miles, Mr. Larounis suggests taking those \u201cmileage runs\u201d early in the year. There are lots of great deals on long flights in January and February after the holiday rush, he said, and padding the mileage account early in the year reduces the stress of putting together last-minute trips later when prices may be higher.Gaining status early in the year also gives the flier more time to enjoy the benefits. On Southwest Airlines, for example, fliers who cross the 25-flight or 35,000-point threshold requirements receive \u201cA-List\u201d benefits immediately, and those benefits extend through the calendar year in which the status is earned as well as the next calendar year.Some airlines give customers who are close to a cutoff at the end of a calendar year the chance to buy their way into a status level. Paying can be an expensive way to go, Mr. Leff said, but can be less of a hassle than taking an extra flight just to rack up miles.On Delta Air Lines, miles earned above a \u201cmedallion tier\u201d threshold are rolled over to give fliers a jump start on next year\u2019s totals. If, for instance, a passenger has flown 30,000 medallion qualifying miles with Delta at the end of the year, that is enough to qualify for the 25,000-mile silver status, and the extra 5,000 miles will be rolled into next year\u2019s total.Ms. Umbach said she mainly kept up her elite status for business reasons, but the little touches mattered, too. She said she flew from Seattle to Boise, Idaho, about once a month to help take care of her parents, and the airplane she takes is small without much food or beverage service.\u201cA flight attendant always comes to my seat to thank me for me being a Gold flier and gives me a chocolate bar,\u201d she said."}, {"title": "What Made the TV Show \u2018You\u2019 a Hit?

Even Mr. Berlanti, one of the most successful and prolific producers in television thanks to shows like \u201cRiverdale,\u201d \u201cArrow\u201d and \u201cBlindspot,\u201d conceded in an interview that \u201cbarely anybody watched\u201d it.He made repeated calls to Lifetime executives, asking for patience and making his case for a second season. It wasn\u2019t enough. In early December, Lifetime announced it was finished with \u201cYou.\u201dBut right after Christmas, something happened. \u201cYou\u201d started lighting up social media. People were searching for it online. Entertainment sites like The Ringer were writing about the show.What changed? It began streaming on Netflix.Mr. Berlanti heard from family and friends about how much they were enjoying his new show, ignoring the fact that it had debuted months earlier.\u201cIt\u2019s very often in direct proportion to how young they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe younger they are, the more they discuss the show as though it had never existed before Dec. 26.\u201d[Read The New York Times review of \u201cYou.\u201d]Last week, Netflix declared \u201cYou\u201d had drawn the sort of audience to make it a \u201chuge hit.\u201d The streaming service said that \u201cYou\u201d was on track to be watched by 40 million households within its first four weeks on the service.The Netflix viewership disclosure \u2014 one of the few times the service has made those numbers public, seven years after it began airing original series \u2014 set off something of an earthquake in the industry.Could the numbers be believed? Could it be possible that a show that premiered on cable television may as well not have existed until Netflix \u2014 which now has 139 million paying subscribers, including 58.5 million in the United States \u2014 came around to stream it? Netflix is already a television network and a movie studio. Was it one step closer to effectively becoming television itself?As Daniel D\u2019Addario, a TV critic for Variety, posited, \u201c\u2018You\u2019 flailing on Lifetime and being treated by the viewing public as a Netflix original is going to be remembered as a major turning point in what will shortly be a contraction of the TV industry.\u201dAnd it should be noted that Lifetime is not exactly a ratings wasteland. Its documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d has been one of the year\u2019s early hits.For the time being, Mr. Berlanti is a believer.\u201cIt went from being one of the least-watched shows I\u2019ve ever worked on and been most proud of \u2014 and I\u2019m choosing to take Netflix at their word on this \u2014 to being the most-watched show I\u2019ve ever worked on in 20-something years of being in the business,\u201d he said.Oh, and Netflix is also making a second season of \u201cYou.\u201d Filming begins next month.Throughout the weekend, rival television executives groused privately that the viewership number Netflix released was virtually meaningless. Netflix explained that each of those 40 million viewers had watched at least 70 percent of one episode. (\u201cYou\u201d has 10 episodes in its first season.)ImageMr. Badgley and Elizabeth Lail, who plays the object of his obsession.CreditWarner BrothersHow that 40 million would translate into a traditional viewership figure is unknown. An average of 12.7 million people have watched this season of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d on CBS, but a significantly higher number of people have sampled at least one episode. Few in the television industry would put much stock in such a figure.When reached for comment, Lifetime referred to an earlier statement it released when it cut ties with \u201cYou,\u201d saying, \u201cWe wish the cast and crew the best as the series continues on at Netflix.\u201dMr. Berlanti began developing \u201cYou\u201d almost four years ago with the producer Sera Gamble. Showtime originally planned to make the series, which is based on a novel by Caroline Kepnes, before passing on it. It then went to Lifetime, which over the summer committed to making a second season.\u201cYou\u201d centers on a Manhattan bookstore manager named Joe (Mr. Badgley) who becomes obsessed with a young woman who stops by his shop. He plumbs her social media channels. He follows her home. He begins reading her text messages. The occasionally hilarious series, which examines internet privacy and youth culture, was warmly received by critics when it debuted in September. The New Yorker called it \u201ca scary, delicious snack of a show.\u201dWhat it could not find was an audience on cable. On the days it aired, it had trouble gaining bigger ratings than the 7 a.m. edition of \u201cSportsCenter.\u201dLuckily for Mr. Berlanti, \u201cYou\u201d had a well-financed supporter.Months before the series premiered, Netflix signed on to be the streaming partner of the series.Bela Bajaria, a vice president of content for Netflix who scooped up the streaming rights, had seen success with \u201cRiverdale,\u201d another of Mr. Berlanti\u2019s series. In its second season, after \u201cRiverdale\u201d began streaming on Netflix, its viewership on the CW shot up 42 percent. Netflix has had that effect on series before, including AMC\u2019s Emmy-winning drama \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d which saw increased viewership totals after it began streaming.Ms. Bajaria was enthusiastic about \u201cYou\u201d from the moment she read the script.\u201cWe really felt this hit a sweet spot for our audience, and we felt that our members would love the show,\u201d she said. \u201cI was hoping it would be big.\u201dBy the time Lifetime decided to renege on its second season commitment in early December, Netflix said it would make a second season even though the series had not started streaming yet.Ms. Bajaria\u2019s confidence in the show was well rewarded. She pored over the viewership numbers between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day and saw Netflix had a hit on its hands immediately after it began streaming.\u201cIt\u2019s actually done well in every region, and that doesn\u2019t always happen,\u201d Ms. Bajaria said, saying she was particularly pleased with its performance in Latin America, France and the Philippines.For Mr. Berlanti, the sudden success of \u201cYou,\u201d after months of despair, was reassuring.\u201cI\u2019ve never had an experience that has been this delayed in television before,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that it was rewarded by people actually watching made us feel we\u2019re not crazy. We actually did make something that was really enjoyable and fun and a real ride for the audience.\u201dMr. Berlanti, beginning to laugh, then compared the series to the obsessive lovelorn character at the heart of \u201cYou.\u201d\u201cIf Joe is a man who is simply just searching for love, well, then, our show finally found the right partner,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "Review: \u2018Twilight of the Elites\u2019 Looks at a France, and a World, Divided", "category": "Business", "id": "7eff2a2f-fb30-4fe4-b801-82f7291379c3", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/business/dealbook/review-twilight-of-the-elites.html", "publishdate": 20190122, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/business/23DB-KNEE-01/merlin_149593584_0ca87fb4-a754-4b0a-a388-994a35da282b-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________Emmanuel Macron\u2019s victory over the far-right National Front party in the French presidential election came only a few months after the ascension of Donald J.

He has written four books on the topic since 2010, and the third of these, originally published in 2016, has just been translated by Yale University Press as \u201cTwilight of the Elites: Prosperity, the Periphery and the Future of France.\u201d Despite the hectoring tone, unfounded generalizations and conspiratorial allusions, the book still manages to provide an indispensable guide to understanding the fears and frustrations of an increasingly permanent underclass \u2014 not just in France, but throughout the world.Mr. Guilluy presents contemporary France as divided between a thriving minority holed up in its 15 largest cities and everybody else. \u201cEverybody else\u201d includes not just the restless immigrant communities living on the outskirts of the \u201cglobalized metropolises,\u201d but residents of the hollowed-out second-tier cities and impoverished rural communities. \u201cThe medieval citadels,\u201d Mr. Guilluy asserts, \u201care back.\u201dMr. Guilluy\u2019s ultimate put-down is the charge that \u201cFrance had become an \u2018American\u2019 society like all the rest.\u201d The defining characteristics of such societies: \u201cinegalitarian and multicultural.\u201d The underlying culprit, however, is globalization, and the villains are \u201cthose who gain from globalization or who are protected against its adverse consequences.\u201d Much of \u201cTwilight of the Elites\u201d is dedicated to demonstrating that the core arguments supporting free markets and cultural diversity are a pretext for maintaining these exclusive benefits.Take what Mr. Guilluy calls \u201cthe lie of the open society.\u201d The elites have cloistered themselves in the cities that are financially out of reach for the rest and \u201cdemand greater social diversity\u201d from a \u201cposition of moral superiority\u201d as part of a \u201ccynical strategy\u201d to secure low-cost immigrant workers. \u201cThe discourse of openness \u2026 for people of different backgrounds may now be seen for what it is,\u201d Mr. Guilluy writes, \u201ca smokescreen devised to conceal the emergence of a closed and isolated society whose greatest beneficiaries are the upper classes.\u201dIf one looks past the overblown rhetoric, the portrait of the bleak prospects of the diverse communities outside of France\u2019s largest cities is disturbing and affecting. It also is reminiscent of the economic challenges faced by many living between the coasts of the United States.While Mr. Guilluy is withering in his criticism of establishment politicians on both the left and right, he does not offer up anything concrete in their place. Besides observing that the working classes have abandoned their previous party attachments and \u201cnow count on themselves to build a countersociety that will provide a decent way of life,\u201d he provides little in the way of policy proposals beyond exhorting the elites \u201cto listen to the grievances of lower France and take them seriously.\u201dPart of the challenge in listening to lower France \u2014 what Mr. Guilluy calls \u201cthe periphery\u201d \u2014 as represented today by the Yellow Vests is that it lacks a unified leadership. The leaders it does have disagree with one another. For someone who is committed to listening as at least part of a solution, Mr. Guilluy has a reputation for refusing to engage with either academics or journalists \u2014 both professions are accused repeatedly in \u201cTwilight of the Elites\u201d of furthering the agenda of the traditional upper classes and \u201cthe new bourgeoisie that supports them.\u201d This is particularly unfortunate given the urgency of the issues he raises. But one does not need to accept all of the elements of Mr. Guilluy\u2019s diagnosis to sense that he has hit on something profound that extends well beyond the borders of France."}, {"title": "Chilling Davos: A Bleak Warning on Global Division and Debt", "category": "Business", "id": "09f0e846-deef-41ee-9170-43e42001abda", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/business/dealbook/world-economic-forum-klarman.html", "publishdate": 20190122, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/22/business/22DB-SORKIN/merlin_149537883_3152d859-f5a4-4832-b317-93f0ebd52d34-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "DAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 As business and political leaders arrive in the Swiss Alps for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, a surprisingly alarming letter from an influential investor who studiously eschews attention has already emerged as a talking point.The letter, written by Seth A. Klarman, a billionaire investor known for his sober and meticulous analysis of the investing world, is a huge red flag about global social tensions, rising debt levels and receding American leadership.Mr. Klarman, a 61-year-old value investor, runs Baupost Group, which manages about $27 billion. He doesn\u2019t make the annual pilgrimage to Davos, but his words are often invoked by policymakers and executives who do. His dire letter, which is considerably bleaker than his previous writings, is a warning shot that a growing sense of political and social divide around the globe may end in an economic calamity.\u201cIt can\u2019t be business as usual amid constant protests, riots, shutdowns and escalating social tensions,\u201d he wrote.He made the remarks in a 22-page annual letter to his investors, which include the endowments of Harvard and Yale and some of the wealthiest families in the world. It was being passed around ahead of the Davos gathering, which draws business leaders like Bill Gates and Sheryl Sandberg, social and cultural figures like Bono, and elected officials like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Mr. Klarman expressed bafflement at how investors often shrugged off President Trump\u2019s Twitter outbursts and the retreating American role in the world during the past year.\u201cAs the post-World War II international order continued to erode, the markets ignored the longer-term implications of a more isolated America, a world increasingly adrift and global leadership up for grabs,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Trump and the United States delegation canceled plans to attend the Davos conference because of the government shutdown, which will leave Ms. Merkel and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan with an opportunity to fill the leadership void.Citing the \u201cyellow vest\u201d marches in France that spread throughout Europe, Mr. Klarman said, \u201cSocial frictions remain a challenge for democracies around the world, and we wonder when investors might take more notice of this.\u201d He added, \u201cSocial cohesion is essential for those who have capital to invest.\u201dMr. Klarman, sometimes called the Oracle of Boston, is one of the few financiers ever praised by that Omaha oracle, Warren Buffett. His views are so sought after that an out-of-print book he wrote about value investing sells for as much as $1,500 on Amazon.The circulation of his letter is likely to add to the hand-wringing that typically takes place in Davos during a week of panels and conversation over Champagne and canap\u00e9s.For one thing, he details the way virtually every developed country has taken on mounting debt since the financial crisis in 2008, a trend that he says could lead to a financial panic. He cites the increasing ratio of government debt to gross domestic product from 2008 to 2017, to a point exceeding 100 percent in the United States and nearing that figure in France, Canada, Britain and Spain.\u201cThe seeds of the next major financial crisis (or the one after that) may well be found in today\u2019s sovereign debt levels,\u201d he said.Mr. Klarman is especially worried about debt load in the United States, what it could mean to the dollar\u2019s status as the world\u2019s reserve currency and how it could ultimately affect the country\u2019s economy.\u201cThere is no way to know how much debt is too much, but America will inevitably reach an inflection point whereupon a suddenly more skeptical debt market will refuse to continue to lend to us at rates we can afford,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBy the time such a crisis hits, it will likely be too late to get our house in order.\u201dMr. Klarman believes that the public, almost irrationally, has become too blas\u00e9 about all these risks and that investors have been lulled into taking on even more risk.\u201cIndividuals, professional investors and financiers are prone to project their own recent experiences into the future,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo when adversity is absent, investors become complacent. They assume good times will continue, and they grow careless about risk, perceiving it through rose-colored lenses.\u201dIn 2017, Mr. Klarman returned some of his fund to his investors, saying he didn\u2019t see enough good investment opportunities. Yet he also acknowledged in his letter that even if he expected an eventual crisis, \u201csince the worst does not frequently happen, you cannot let the fear of a monster storm completely paralyze you.\u201d He seems to wrestle in his letter with how to continue investing profitably while protecting himself and his firm against his fatalistic expectations.Mr. Klarman, a registered independent, was a donor to Republicans for years but has become a critic of Mr. Trump and has sought to elect Democrats to neutralize him. He said in his letter that he was particularly worried about the social and economic implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to paint accurate information as \u201cfake news.\u201d\u201cThis post-truth moment is quite dangerous,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote. \u201cImagine an incident that threatens national security. Will Americans see eye to eye on the seriousness of the threat? If our leaders are truth-challenged, will Americans believe the official explanation of the threat and the wisdom of the proposed response? Should they?\u201dThe many technology companies in Davos \u2014 Facebook, Google and Amazon among them \u2014 may also want to take note of Mr. Klarman\u2019s anxiety that \u201cmore and more people are choosing to only seek out information from those who share their views\u201d and his blame that \u201ctechnology and social media have made it increasingly easy to do so.\u201dWhether a crisis is around the corner or still years away, Mr. Klarman seems relatively convinced that it is coming and that it will manifest itself not just in a market downturn but potentially in more violence as well.\u201cIt is not hard to imagine worsening social unrest among a generation,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat is falling behind economically and feels betrayed by a massive national debt that was incurred without any obvious benefit to them.\u201d"}, {"title": "Carlos Ghosn Is Denied Bail as Jail Stint Looks to Continue", "category": "Business", "id": "96b5a0a1-5607-4993-a4f6-5736e79d8121", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/business/carlos-ghosn-denied-bail-nissan.html", "publishdate": 20190122, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/21/sports/00ghosndenied-1/merlin_149497881_f3d57c8d-bfaa-4fee-b35a-93047d714c17-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "TOKYO \u2014 For the second time in a week, a Japanese court has rejected a bail request by Carlos Ghosn, the former global auto chieftain who has spent more than two months in a Tokyo jail.A Japanese judge, after reviewing a request from Mr. Ghosn\u2019s lawyers in which he offered to pay for private security guards and surrender all of his passports, ruled on Tuesday that Mr. Ghosn would have to stay in detention.

He was detained on Nov. 19 in a dramatic arrest off his corporate jet and has been held in Tokyo ever since. His trial could be months away.In a court appearance early this month, Mr. Ghosn denied guilt over charges that he improperly transferred personal losses to Nissan\u2019s books and withheld millions of dollars in income from Nissan\u2019s financial filings for years as the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive.While Mr. Ghosn sits in jail, the fate of Nissan and its partners in a vast global alliance \u2014 Renault of France and Mitsubishi of Japan \u2014 has hung in the balance.

But its impact could be global: If Apple were to build a so-called back door for iPhones sold in Australia, the authorities in other countries, including the United States, could force the company to use that same tool to assist their investigations.The Australian law went into effect last month. It is one of the most assertive efforts by lawmakers to rein in tech companies, which have argued for decades that unbreakable encryption is an imperative part of protecting the private communications of their customers.In recent years, law enforcement officials have complained that tough encryption has made it impossible for them to gain access to the online discussions of crime suspects, particularly in time-sensitive terror investigations.The tension between tech and law enforcement came to a head about four years ago when Apple resisted a federal request to help investigators gain access to a locked iPhone that had belonged to a man who took part in a shooting that killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif.Image\u201cWe never thought it would pass,\u201d Alan Jones of M8 Ventures, a tech investment firm in Sydney, said of the law, which could have global implications.CreditBrook Mitchell for The New York TimesThe Federal Bureau of Investigation eventually found a way around the iPhone\u2019s security without Apple\u2019s help. But if Apple had already created a workaround \u2014 a back door, in industry terms \u2014 to sell phones in Australia, the American authorities could have simply ordered Apple to use the tool.\u201cThis may be an encryption back door for the U.S.,\u201d said Sharon Bradford Franklin, director of surveillance and cybersecurity policy for the New America think tank\u2019s Open Technology Institute. \u201cA back door to an encryption back door.\u201dThe Australian law has limited oversight mechanisms. A notice sent to a company must be \u201creasonable and proportionate,\u201d and the authorities must have a warrant to gain access to a phone or service. But the agency issuing the notice decides what is reasonable.There is an appeals process if a company is asked to build a new interception capability. A firm can ask an independent assessment panel consisting of a technical expert and a former judicial officer to review the notice.The law says the Australian authorities cannot ask a company to build universal decryption capabilities or introduce systemwide weaknesses. But security experts and tech companies like Apple said that did not reflect what they would have to do to comply with an order. It is impossible, for example, to create a workaround for one iPhone\u2019s encryption without potentially introducing something that could work for all of them, they said.\u201cAll of Australian technology is tarnished by it,\u201d said Mike Cannon-Brookes, one of the founders of Atlassian, a business software company that is among Australia\u2019s biggest tech companies.ImageSarah Moran, whose Girl Geek Academy teaches young women to code in Australia, is now asking herself, \u201cWhy would I tell young girls to go build tech here if there\u2019s not going to be any tech industry?\u201dCreditAsanka Brendon Ratnayake for The New York TimesAustralia is a member of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance, and it is not the only country in the alliance with a law like this. Britain passed the Investigatory Powers Act in 2016. For British law enforcement to gain access to data, it must first ask a judicial approver.\u201cWe\u2019re not the first,\u201d said Michelle Price, chief executive of the nonprofit Australian Cyber Security Growth Network. \u201cBut Australia\u2019s version has gone much further.\u201dApple officials called the law \u201cdangerously ambiguous\u201d and \u201calarming.\u201d\u201cEncryption is simply math,\u201d Apple wrote in a statement submitted to the Australian Parliament\u2019s Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on Oct. 12. \u201cAny process that weakens the mathematical models that protect user data for anyone will by extension weaken the protections for everyone.\u201dBut politicians said the risk of encryption technology\u2019s being used by terrorists was too significant. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia said in July, \u201cThe laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.\u201dTechnology companies in the United States have argued that they cannot be compelled to create tools for breaking the encryption in their products because computer code is a kind of free speech protected under the First Amendment. But building tools to satisfy the Australian authorities would essentially make that argument moot. Countries around the world could demand access to the tool.Apple is hardly the only tech company that could feel the impact of the Australian law. Anyone with a website is considered a communications provider, subject to the law. Any company that \u201cprovides an electronic service that has one or more end-users in Australia\u201d is required to comply.A long list of companies meets that description, such as smartphone makers and Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service.\u201cOnce WhatsApp, for example, builds a system at the behest of the Australians, everyone gets to use it,\u201d said Nate Cardozo, the senior information security counsel on the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2019s legal team, who has studied the new law.The law allows government agencies like the Australian Secret Intelligence Service or the Australian Federal Police to compel tech companies to install software on a user\u2019s device to get around encryption. It can also compel the company not to alert the user.\u201cSo if WhatsApp gets one of these notices and does not comply, they\u2019re subject to asset seizure and even hypothetically having executives hauled into jail for contempt if they refuse to do so,\u201d Mr. Cardozo said.There is confusion about other secrecy requirements of the law. For example, would it require employees who received requests to keep them secret from their employers? The Australian Department of Home Affairs, which coordinates strategy and leadership of the country\u2019s national security policy, says it would not. But security experts at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and at companies like the password manager 1Password say it is actually unclear.Australia does not have a strong tech industry, but it is growing, with investors and start-ups and a few established companies. And in the tightknit tech community that does exist, the new law has been a gut punch.ImageA Girl Geek Academy session in Melbourne, Australia. Supporters of the nation\u2019s new law say security workarounds are needed to fight terrorists who exploit encryption technology.CreditAsanka Brendon Ratnayake for The New York Times\u201cWe never thought it would pass,\u201d said Alan Jones, chief executive of M8 Ventures, a tech investment firm in Sydney. \u201cWe all just figured that Australia\u2019s political leaders would consider the expert advice that told them this was nuts.\u201dSarah Moran, the chief executive of Girl Geek Academy, which teaches young women to code, said she had planned to begin tech start-ups in Australia until the law passed.\u201cI was looking to found two tech companies, but why would you build tech here now?\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government understands how drastically it impacts not just the tech that\u2019s built here but also the enthusiasm and entrepreneurial investment that Australians will be willing to make.\u201dMs. Moran, who is based in Melbourne, said she was questioning even the program she currently runs. \u201cWhy would I tell young girls to go build tech here if there\u2019s not going to be any tech industry?\u201d she asked.Casey Ellis, 37, was raised in Sydney but lives in San Francisco, where he runs a cybersecurity firm called Bugcrowd.

Day and night, the warehouse, and dozens of cargo containers in a windswept valley, are generating Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that has created a virtual gold rush in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.Bitfury, a bitcoin technology company, is churning out millions of dollars\u2019 worth of the digital money using ultracheap hydropower harvested from waters rushing down the volcanic peaks of the Caucasus. Even as the currency has tumbled in value, thousands of Georgians have jumped into the game and sold cars \u2014 even cows \u2014 to buy high-powered computers to mine Bitcoin and join what has become a state-supported dash toward data supremacy.A former prime minister encouraged Bitfury, then based in San Francisco, with a $10 million loan in 2015. The governing Georgian Dream party sold 45 acres for $1 for Bitfury to set up shop.

It is now an energy guzzler, with nearly 10 percent of its energy output gone into the currency endeavor. The country consumed so much power in recent years that the World Bank ranked it one of the most active cryptocurrency sites in the world.The whole experiment is likely to face immediate challenges as the price of Bitcoin declines, after a spectacular rise tempted investors around the world to bet on cryptocurrencies.Most companies tend to lose money when the price of Bitcoin falls below energy costs, and mining operators worldwide have recently been scaling back. The largest mining company, the Chinese company Bitmain, has been closing offices and laying off workers. Last week, Bitfury, which incorporated in London in 2018, announced layoffs at a facility in Canada.Georgia, however, has been betting its economy on luring blockchain technology, the encrypted storage capability behind all crypto transactions.Bitfury has helped migrate most of Georgia\u2019s land registry to blockchain, making the government one of the first to rely on the secure digital ledger. Its tax system may soon follow. Georgia aims to beat Malta, Bermuda and other countries known for light-touch regulation of cryptocurrencies to dominate blockchain development.\u201cThe economy\u2019s digital transformation is our highest priority,\u201d said George Kobulia, the economy minister. \u201cWe\u2019re supporting this any way we can.\u201dImageBidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister who lives in a $50 million complex in Tbilisi, gave Bitfury a $10 million loan through his investment fund.CreditDaro Sulakauri for The New York TimesA Low-Tax FrontierIn downtown Tbilisi, a neon-lit Marriott welcomes tourists.

When Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were exchanged for dollars or pounds, Georgia treated the exchange as an export exempt from value added taxes, so Bitfury could keep every penny of earnings.Rumors have swirled that Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister from the Georgian Dream party and the country\u2019s richest oligarch, has been a secret beneficiary of the digital experiment. He gave Bitfury a $10 million loan through his investment fund when Bitfury\u2019s executive vice chairman, George Kikvadze, sat on his investment board.ImageTbilisi is the capital of one of the world\u2019s most active cryptocurrency nations in terms of energy use.CreditDaro Sulakauri for The New York TimesMr. Ivanishvili declined an interview.

He had no other ties to Bitfury, Mr. Urumashvili added.The government even expanded an entire power station next to the Bitfury facility to pump in electricity at no extra cost. With energy prices at 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, Bitfury and its supporters could envision prosperity, if not around the corner then somewhere just beyond the fog of Georgia\u2019s storied mountains.Mining With FriendsWhen Bitfury came to Georgia, one Bitcoin was worth around $350. It spiked to nearly $20,000 before tumbling. Big players like Bitfury have bandwidth to keep operating. But smaller investors have been far more vulnerable.ImageVakhtang Gogokhia is the chief executive of Golden Fleece, a small Bitfury competitor in Georgia.CreditDaro Sulakauri for The New York TimesIn villages across Georgia, an estimated 200,000 people secured mining computers to set up in basements and garages. For young people especially who struggled in a tough economy, Bitcoin seemed an alluring alternative to just making ends meet.Joining the rush was George Kirvalidze, 35, the former owner of a small internet company in the town of Kvareli, three hours from Tbilisi in Georgian wine country.About half the town\u2019s 6,000 households have some kind of a mining rig, he said.\u201cMost people who bought in thought high prices would last forever,\u201d said Mr. Kirvalidze, who has managed to mine 20 Bitcoins.ImageWhen Bitcoin was on the rise, Georgia\u2019s tough economy led an estimated 200,000 people to set up mining computers.CreditDaro Sulakauri for The New York TimesEven farmers got involved. \u201cAt one point it was more profitable than owning a cow,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s not so sure.\u201dCryptocurrency lives off a blizzard of mathematical calculations. Computers, or miners, around the world compete to solve complex formulas on the blockchain. When a mining computer gets the right answer, it is given a bundle of new Bitcoins as a reward.The constant calculating superheats computers, and the energy demand \u2014 to power the computers and to cool them \u2014 has spiraled in places where such currencies are pursued.ImageA market in Telavi.

More would shut down if prices continued to slump, he added.\u201cBitfury is one step ahead of us,\u201d Mr. Kirvalidze observed, citing the company\u2019s cutting-edge technology and quasi-state backing in Georgia.\u201cIf we could get cheaper energy prices, too, we could make more,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would increase money circulating in the economy and eventually improve growth.\u201dImageMr. Kirvalidze has mined 20 Bitcoins. \u201cMost people who bought in thought high prices would last forever,\u201d he said.CreditDaro Sulakauri for The New York Times\u2018Onto the World Map\u2019Forty-five minutes from the center of Tbilisi, trucks rumble over two-lane roads and past faded pink and yellow high-rises. A prison, in matching pink and yellow paint, blights a cow pasture. In the middle of the valley rises the gray confines of Bitfury, plunked on a 40-acre concrete strip protected by guards and a high wire fence.In a warehouse as big as a Walmart, Ilia Koranashvili, a muscular engineer with a snake tattoo, walked around 160 hermetically sealed stainless steel tanks filled with power-efficient chips and a special cooling liquid. The tanks are Bitfury\u2019s experiment to keep energy costs down and make the mining cost effective almost anywhere, said Mr. Koranashvili, who heads Bitfury\u2019s monitoring team.Industry estimates suggest the company mines just over 5 percent of all Bitcoins, although no one would say how much was being mined here.But competitors in Georgia reckon it was a fortune. Vakhtang Gogokhia, the chief executive of Golden Fleece, a small cryptomining start-up, said he was pulling in around 10 Bitcoins a month using one megawatt of energy, enough to light 1,000 homes. Bitfury says it constantly consumes at least 45 megawatts of energy, though Mr. Gogokhia suspected it was more.Critics say the government, by subsidizing operations like Bitfury, is ripping off taxpayers by forcing them to foot the bill for well-connected companies.Zurab Tchiaberashvili, a lawmaker from European Georgia, the largest opposition party in Parliament, said the government\u2019s generosity toward Bitfury had deprived Georgians of millions in tax revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge conflict of interest,\u201d he said.Mr. Urumashvili brushed off such concerns. \u201cBitfury has given our country many things, including a path to the future,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you have a ticket to get onto the world map,\u201d he added, \u201cyou should use it.\u201dStill, as Bitcoin prices highlight the uncertain nature of cryptocurrencies, the government isn\u2019t putting all of its eggs in one basket.\u201cGeorgia is interesting for cryptocurrency miners,\u201d said Mr. Kobulia, the economy minister. \u201cBut would it be a major source of our economic growth? Maybe not.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: World Economic Forum Begins With a Warning", "category": "Business", "id": "ca512f38-47c5-43d9-99be-8af354a5aab1", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/business/dealbook/davos-world-economic-forum.html", "publishdate": 20190122, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/business/23db-davos/merlin_149567697_a78516b7-206d-4c42-9897-19fa084015c6-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Tuesday morning.

Sign up here.A bleak message reverberates in DavosAn influential financier warned investors in a letter to pay heed to growing risks and social tensions \u2014 and the message is already resonating at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Andrew writes in his column.In his annual letter, Seth A. Klarman, the billionaire investor who runs the Baupost Group hedge fund, warns that social and political division risks economic calamity:\u201cIt can\u2019t be business as usual amid constant protests, riots, shutdowns and escalating social tensions.\u201dHis message is likely to encourage hand-wringing of a sort usually seen in Davos, Andrew writes.Mr. Klarman says mounting debt in developed countries since the 2008 financial crisis could lead to a financial panic. He is especially worried about the debt load in the United States:\u201cThere is no way to know how much debt is too much, but America will inevitably reach an inflection point whereupon a suddenly more skeptical debt market will refuse to continue to lend to us at rates we can afford. By the time such a crisis hits, it will likely be too late to get our house in order.\u201dMore from Davos: Political turmoil has led several world leaders to skip the gathering. And less than a quarter of people attending are women.____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________China\u2019s economy expands at its slowest paceThe world\u2019s second largest economy grew 6.6 percent last year, the Chinese government said on Monday \u2014 its most sedate pace in nearly three decades. The slowdown intensified in the last three months of 2018, and the official jobless rate increased to 4.9 percent last month from 4.8 percent in November.Economists tend to be skeptical about official data from Beijing, but there\u2019s been an onslaught of evidence recently for weakness in the Chinese economy, brought on by crushing debt, a bitter trade fight with the U.S. and evolving business norms.Factory jobs are no longer desirable, leading manufacturers to try automation, according to the NYT. Ford Motor assembly plants in Chongqing are slowing production. Chinese exporters have delayed hiring plans.And China\u2019s securities industry last year suffered its first annual decline in head count since 2014. Bonuses are likely to shrink, too.Officials around the world are sounding the alarm:\u2022 Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m, the European Union\u2019s commissioner for trade, said that European investment in China was declining, because doing business there was \u201cbecoming increasingly complicated.\u201d\u2022 Heng Swee Keat, the finance minister of Singapore, a nation heavily reliant on international trade, said at the World Economic Forum that trade friction between China and the U.S. could have a \u201cvery negative\u201d effect on the global economy.\u2022 President Xi Jinping of China said on Monday that his Communist Party faced \u201csharp and serious dangers\u201d:The party is facing long-term and complex tests in terms of maintaining long-term rule, reform and opening-up, a market-driven economy, and within the external environment.ImageChristine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F.CreditFabrice Coffrini/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesI.M.F. expects a \u2018serious slowdown\u2019The International Monetary Fund brought a chill to this week\u2019s down-jacketed procession of world leaders, cutting its global economic growth forecasts.The fund expects weakness in Europe, a slowdown in China, a possible no-deal Brexit and trade spats sustained by the U.S. to lead to 3.5 percent growth in 2019 and 3.6 percent growth in 2020, down from October\u2019s forecasts.\u201cRisks are rising\u201d after two years of \u201csolid expansion,\u201d said Christine Lagarde, its managing director. She added:\u201cDoes that mean a global recession is around the corner? No. But the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased.\u201dMore on the global outlook:\u2022 The I.M.F. got a new chief economist this month: Gita Gopinath of Harvard, the first woman in the role. She issued warnings at Davos about China and Brexit.\u2022 Central banks are grappling with how to use verbal cues and other hints to signal their plans as conditions get tougher.\u2022 Some 30 percent of business leaders expect global expansion to slow \u2014 six times the number who felt that way a year ago, according to a survey from PricewaterhouseCoopers. It found 37 percent of North American executives optimistic, down from 63 percent last year.\u2022 But in what Matt Phillips called \u201ca remarkable turnaround,\u201d stocks have surged in the first few weeks of the year after a substantial plunge at the end of 2018. Buoyed by assurances from the Federal Reserve, it is the market\u2019s best start to a year since 1987.Shutdown Day 32: Rejected proposals and old habitsAs a flash freeze arrived in the Midwest and the Northeast, the shutdown continued to weigh on the homeless, the elderly, veterans, low-income renters and many others.Democrats, who have refused to negotiate until the government is reopened, rejected a proposal from President Trump on Saturday to exchange temporary protections for some immigrants for $5.7 billion for a border wall. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, called it \u201chostage taking.\u201dIn response, Mr. Trump complained that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has behaved \u201cirrationally,\u201d and then took a shot at San Francisco, which she represents. The bulk of Republican senators have fallen in line behind his proposal, and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, is said to be incorporating the terms into a broader package.Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior feels familiar, write Russ Beuttner and Maggie Haberman:As he did during decades in business, Mr. Trump has insulted adversaries, undermined his aides, repeatedly changed course, extolled his primacy as a negotiator and induced chaos.More shutdown news:\u2022 Companies unable to finalize approval for initial public offerings are trying to move ahead with workarounds.\u2022 Hours before the shutdown began, Mr. Trump signed a bipartisan criminal justice bill. Implementation is likely to be delayed.\u2022 The stock market is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite indicators of his administration\u2019s success. But at times, the going\u2019s been bumpy.Brinkmanship over BrexitAfter her Brexit plan was defeated, Prime Minister Theresa May returned to Parliament yesterday with a Plan B. It looked a lot like Plan A, writes Stephen Castle, setting the stage for another battle with rebellious lawmakers.The proposal: Mrs. May promised to negotiate changes that many regard as cosmetic.The strategy: She appeared to double down on her gamble that lawmakers will eventually hold their noses and vote for her plan, rather than risk a no-deal Brexit or no Brexit at all.The response: Frustration. The process is more or less where it has been for months, with Mrs. May locked in a game of brinkmanship as the clock ticks down.More Brexit news: Britain\u2019s main opposition party is backing a proposal that could open the door to a second referendum. The European Union is increasing its efforts to avoid market chaos if there\u2019s no deal. Companies buying British assets are having to find financing in euros or dollars, if they can find it at all. Two trading platforms are moving out of London. There\u2019s been violence in Northern Ireland. Britain\u2019s statistics agency could find no evidence for a claim that Brexit is making food companies shrink their products.

Spending on the initiative also fell somewhat last year, as the broader Chinese economy slowed.Various senior Chinese government officials are at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, including Vice President Wang Qishan, who is to speak on Wednesday. None of them, though, participated in a panel during one of the forum\u2019s most prominent time slots Tuesday that was focused on the Belt and Road Initiative and billed as a review of \u201cChina\u2019s trillion-dollar vision.\u201dInstead, the vice chairman of a government-linked trade association and the chairman of a state-owned business spoke cautiously about the initiative.Except for a long-scheduled meeting with African leaders in Beijing in September, top Chinese officials have said fairly little about the Belt and Road program since last summer. The initiative has been plagued by allegations of corruption, overspending on vanity projects, excessive debt and other problems in countries like Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Uganda.The panel on Tuesday seemed like an opportunity to recast the initiative\u2019s image to a crowd stacked with government leaders and tycoons from developing countries, many of which have borrowed heavily from Chinese financial institutions to build infrastructure as part of the program.But China took a different tack. Xu Niansha, the chairman of the state-owned China Poly Group, apologized for not having many statistics about the program, a rare occurrence given that Chinese corporate or government officials often lard their speeches and discussions with numbers.Speaking in general terms, Mr. Xu said China\u2019s rapid economic growth in recent decades had put it in a better position than many countries to foster economic development elsewhere. \u201cWe do know what people need,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why I think we can do a better job in cooperation.\u201dThe most recently available data from China\u2019s commerce ministry shows that the value of newly signed contracts under the Belt and Road Initiative fell 20.4 percent in the first 11 months of last year compared with the same period in 2017. Almost all of these contracts are financed by state-owned Chinese financial institutions.(Frank Ning, the chairman of the Chinese chemical giant Sinochem, said during a different panel that there was a new awareness in China about worries outside the country over how its businesses make overseas investments. \u201cI think the Chinese are quite confused, they thought they would be welcome in other countries,\u201d he said.)The Belt and Road discussion was moderated by Tian Wei, a well-known anchor for the state-run China Global Television Network, making the absence of Chinese government officials, who typically shun panels with foreign moderators known to have criticized China, somewhat surprising.Ms. Tian repeatedly hinted at the resentment felt by some people in China about foreign criticisms of the Belt and Road program, which she said was helping to build roads in developing countries that need them. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about facts, let\u2019s talk about case studies, and let\u2019s talk about the real stories, not just hearsay,\u201d she added.Wang Yongqing, the vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, mentioned during the panel that China had helped build an industrial park in Ethiopia that makes leather products. But he and Mr. Xu avoided specifics about the hundreds of Belt and Road infrastructure projects already completed or underway. Critics say Chinese construction companies have moved so quickly partly because they bring in thousands of Chinese workers instead of training locals, and because they arrange special deals with local officials in developing countries that allow them to avoid paying tariffs on machinery that they ship in.Sitting in the audience was Xiao Yaqing, the government minister who oversees state-owned enterprises. Asked to speak by Ms. Tian, he suggested one possible reason for Chinese officials\u2019 caution when he said the Belt and Road push was good for Chinese companies as well as for other countries.There have sometimes been criticisms on Chinese social media, quickly deleted by censors, that Beijing was spending money on overseas development that would be better spent at home, particularly when economic growth is slowing in the country.China has been rethinking two aspects of the initiative: how it decides on overseas spending, and how the initiative is presented to overseas audiences. In September, Mr. Xi promised a further $60 billion for projects in African countries, but he made a point of saying that China would not pay for what he called vanity projects.Nobody thinks Belt and Road is fading away. Mr. Wang, the trade association vice chairman, said China would invite entrepreneurs to events next fall that emphasized business opportunities through the initiative.Among business leaders from countries like India that have been skeptical of the initiative, there are continuing worries that it will keep moving ahead, and leave them behind.\u201cIndian business leaders are concerned that China is building linkages around the world,\u201d Gaurav Dalmia, the chairman of the Indian conglomerate Dalmia Group, said in an interview before the panel talk. \u201cIndian companies may get left out on the resource side.\u201d"}, {"title": "\u2018Boutique\u2019 Co-Working Spaces Find a Niche Nurturing Small Businesses", "category": "Business", "id": "f27f55d9-b3e4-4c2a-91d0-5f7ac09ad63f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/business/co-working-spaces-small-business.html", "publishdate": 20190122, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/business/23COWORKING-01/23COWORKING-01-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "In a refurbished Salvation Army building in downtown Lincoln, Neb., Bob Hinrichs runs a co-working space for about 150 people.The workers are not allowed to bring in their dogs, and they don\u2019t curl up in beanbag chairs. But they are encouraged to collaborate with one another and with the city\u2019s wider business community.Mr. Hinrichs works to nurture connections among the small businesses \u2014 software developers, public-relations consultants and sustainable-agriculture advocates \u2014 that work in his space, and he says such cooperation is helping the local economy.Like other operators of so-called boutique co-working spaces in smaller cities, Mr. Hinrichs is also seeking to distinguish his business, Fuse Coworking, from the big players like WeWork and Regus.The fast-expanding co-working movement is transforming the workplace and attracting investors. The Japanese telecom conglomerate SoftBank recently increased its stake in WeWork to about $10.5 billion, valuing it at $47 billion.Some larger competitors strive to create a freewheeling atmosphere by allowing pets and skateboards in their work spaces and offering Ping-Pong tables and juice bars. But Mr. Hinrichs said his members felt a sense of belonging in a distinctively local building and benefited from regular contact with business leaders in the community.\u201cYou have access in Lincoln to people and getting things done, and a sort of can-do, barn-raising mentality,\u201d he said.ImageFuse offers services ranging from drop-in desks for $50 a month to \u201cdedicated desks\u201d plus 20 hours of meeting-room space for $300 a month.CreditWalker Pickering for The New York TimesMr. Hinrichs returned to his native Lincoln seven years ago after living in the Bay Area, where he became interested in the co-working concept. \u201cThe co-working space came out of that,\u201d he said.Since opening, Fuse Coworking has expanded to about 40,000 square feet from 2,500 square feet. Its services range from drop-in desks for the occasional worker for $50 a month to \u201cdedicated desks\u201d plus 20 hours of meeting-room space for $300 a month.The space, the first of its kind in Lincoln, is used by about 55 companies that employ anywhere from one to 35 people. It has been embraced by the city\u2019s business community, which sees it as an important incubator and contributor to the local economy, Mr. Hinrichs said.In Pittsburgh, the Detective Building, which once housed the Police Department\u2019s homicide division, is the latest location for Beauty Shoppe, a commercial real estate developer that creates co-working spaces intended to have local appeal.It\u2019s the seventh space opened in Pittsburgh by Beauty Shoppe, which seeks buildings in neighborhoods that it views as underserved by co-working space. The company also has a space in Cleveland, and it just started construction on one in Detroit. It has plans for more in Portland, Me.; Providence, R.I.; and Columbus, Ohio.ImageA co-working space in Pittsburgh developed by Beauty Shoppe, which creates the work spaces to have local appeal.CreditKaren Lue for Beauty Shoppe\u201cThey are in places that are underdiscovered but have a bit of soul and character and we see an undersupply of quality co-working,\u201d said Matthew Ciccone, one of the company\u2019s founders.With its modular sofas, coffee tables and high ceilings, the new space is meant to be a comfortable and productive place for businesses that include not only the tech start-ups that might be expected, but also people like accountants, lawyers, graphic designers and architects.Mr. Ciccone said small businesses were better served in boutique co-working spaces than in national chains like WeWork, and would benefit from more amenities than in conventional office spaces.\u201cIf you are a four-person graphic design company, your options are usually substandard Class B office space with an old-school stodgy landlord that just doesn\u2019t provide a lot of services for you and your employees,\u201d he said.Mr. Ciccone\u2019s clients include Courtney Watts, an employee of the I.T. consultant Infosys in Chicago, who moved back to her native Pittsburgh a year ago after about a dozen years away. She signed up with Beauty Shoppe with the aim of reconnecting with the city.Ms. Watts, 30, commutes to Chicago, where she usually works three or four days a week. The rest of her time, she alternates among three Beauty Shoppe locations. She connected with other workers there more easily than she had in bigger co-working spaces in Boston and Toronto, which she called \u201cmore cookie cutter.\u201d\u201cOf all the co-working spaces I\u2019ve worked, I haven\u2019t felt it as strongly as I have with Beauty Shoppe,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to talk to each other. People want to know what the other person is up to.\u201dBenjamin Schmidt, chief technology officer for RoadBotics, a two-year-old technology company, said he and his fellow founders had chosen to rent space in the Pittsburgh Detective Building because its individual design, with exposed steel beams, was more attractive than the \u201coffice vibe\u201d at some other co-working spaces they had looked at.He said any co-working space made more sense for his staff, about 30 full- and part-time employees, than a conventional office building because of the lower costs and greater amenities.ImageThe Fuse Coworking space in Lincoln, the first of its kind in the city, is used by about 55 companies that employ anywhere from one to 35 people.CreditWalker Pickering for The New York Times\u201cIf we were to sign a commercial lease, it would be a three- or five-year term,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any idea where we\u2019re going to be three or five years from now. I don\u2019t know whether we will exist.\u201dHe added, \u201cFor a start-up or a small business, co-working space is a no-brainer when it comes to value.\u201dDespite the efforts of boutique co-working spaces to differentiate themselves from bigger competitors, it\u2019s not clear whether they will be able to maintain their edge while growing, said Kevin Michals, managing partner at Cross Properties, a building owner and developer in Philadelphia.He predicted that co-working spaces would become standardized as they consolidated, as big corporate clients increasingly demanded a consistent product across multiple locations and as venture capitalists investing in co-working providers sought returns.\u201cIf I\u2019m I.B.M., I don\u2019t want to sign a hundred different contracts in six different cities,\u201d said Mr. Michals, whose company is refurbishing a 50,000-square-foot building for Regus in downtown Philadelphia.But some boutique owners remain convinced that small is beautiful, and they have no plans to homogenize their spaces.Nick Petroski, one of the founders of OSC Tech Lab, a 45-member co-working space in an old railroad building in Akron, Ohio, said smaller locations had the best chance of competing with the big players by creating a personalized atmosphere.\u201cWe decided to take a different route where we actually give a damn about the people that are here, and we ended up making friends with a lot of them,\u201d said Mr. Petroski, who has doubled his space to 5,000 square feet over five years. \u201cOn busy days, you are getting a lot of people, and it\u2019s harder to find a spot.\u201d"}, {"title": "Recent Commercial Real Estate Transactions", "category": "Business", "id": "743bb218-585a-4b92-9f46-ee5ad8238727", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/realestate/commercial/new-york-commercial-real-estate.html", "publishdate": 20190122, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/realestate/commercial/23Sub2For-Sale/23Sub2For-Sale--articleLarge.jpg", "content": "FOR SALE$12.495 MILLION124-134 Forrest Street (between Flushing and Central Avenues)Bushwick, BrooklynThis 25,840-square-foot industrial building, with two contiguous warehouses and an adjacent 4,990-square-foot lot, is available on the border of East Williamsburg, a few blocks from the redevelopment site of the former Rheingold brewery.

One featured accomplishment is how the company has thrived in Europe.A chapter in one of the books describes the hard work of Huawei employees to win over European telecom providers and sell them equipment that forms the backbone of mobile wireless networks. It says little about how the company has also subtly lobbied, promised jobs and made research investments to ingratiate itself with European governments over the last 15 years.In Britain, for example, Huawei set up a special corporate board, led by John Browne, a former chief executive of the oil giant BP. It donated to schools, including Cambridge University; held parties for political leaders; and sponsored prominent charities like the Prince\u2019s Trust, founded by Prince Charles. In Germany, Huawei opened facilities to conduct research on new innovations and sponsored events, including the recent convention of Germany\u2019s governing Christian Democratic Union party.European governments have been welcoming. Last year, after Huawei announced a five-year commitment to spend 3 billion pounds, or about $3.8 billion, to expand in Britain, where the company employs 1,500 workers, Prime Minister Theresa May met in Beijing with Sun Yafang, Huawei\u2019s chairwoman. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany posed for pictures at the company\u2019s booth at a trade show last year.Yet despite the careful cultivation, Huawei\u2019s position in Europe is now at risk of unraveling. The United States has moved to restrict the use of Chinese technology because of concerns that it is being used for espionage. Last month, the American authorities asked Canada to detain a Huawei executive, who is the daughter of the company\u2019s founder, on charges of committing bank fraud to help the company\u2019s business in Iran. And federal prosecutors in Seattle are also investigating Huawei for intellectual property theft.[Read More: The United States plans to formally make its extradition request within a week.]The fallout is growing across Europe, which has become Huawei\u2019s biggest market outside China, foreshadowing what the company faces in the rest of the world. This month, one of its employees was arrested in Poland and charged with espionage.Officials in Germany, France and the Czech Republic are now among those considering restricting Huawei from the next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G. The head of Britain\u2019s intelligence service, MI6, has raised alarms about using Chinese networking technology. European carriers, including Deutsche Telekom, are reassessing their use of Huawei. And on Thursday, Oxford University announced that it would suspend donations and scholarships from Huawei.\u201cUntil there were red flags on security risks, it was smooth sailing for them in Europe,\u201d Thorsten Benner, a founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a policy think tank in Berlin, said of Huawei. \u201cThe movement that you\u2019ve seen over the past three months is all in one direction: to find regulatory measures to curtail the use of Chinese equipment in Europe.\u201dHeli Tiirmaa-Klaar, an Estonian diplomat involved in cybersecurity discussions with American and European officials about Huawei, said Europe was shifting on Huawei because of suspicions about China rather than specific actions by the company. She highlighted China\u2019s history of hacking and stealing trade secrets, its poor record on human rights and internet censorship, and Chinese cybersecurity rules that could require network operators to defend national security interests.\u201cThe Chinese are increasingly departing from the common vision that we\u2019ve had at the U.N. level about what are cybernorms and how we follow international law in cyberspace,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have no willingness to play along in this space.\u201dHuawei (pronounced \u201cHWA-way\u201d) has steadfastly denied wrongdoing. In a statement, the company said it had \u201cestablished strong relations with customers, suppliers and governments across Europe, where cybersecurity has been our top priority.\u201d It added that its growth in Europe was the result of its strong track record, not lobbying. Interacting with government officials is common among large corporations, Huawei said.For European countries, disentangling from Huawei won\u2019t be easy. Its equipment is a crucial part of wireless infrastructure in Europe, and the company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on 5G research, opening testing hubs in Britain, Germany and Poland. The company has said countries that ban Huawei, like the United States, risk delaying construction of the new hyperfast network.ImageHuawei recently helped sponsor the convention of Germany\u2019s governing Christian Democratic Union party.CreditAndreas Rinke/ReutersHuawei, based in Shenzhen, China, entered Europe in 2001 but struggled to gain a foothold. It kept pushing because it wanted to expand internationally. The European market became even more important after the company was mostly shut out of the United States in 2012 over security concerns.At one point in 2004, Huawei was so eager to woo European customers that it outfitted a shipping container with its wireless equipment and parked it in front of the headquarters of phone carriers in Germany. The marketing stunt was intended to get employees of those carriers to stop and look.\u201cA lot of them said, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u201d said Stefan Scheuerle, a former Huawei sales manager in Europe who is now chief revenue officer at Sensorberg, a German tech company.In a breakthrough, Huawei struck a deal to provide equipment to BT Group, the British telecom giant, in 2005. To prepare its bid for the BT project, Huawei moved about 100 Chinese workers to hastily rented apartments outside London, according to \u201cGrowing Up in a Hail of Gunfire,\u201d a collection of essays used as training material for new hires. The employees often worked until 3 or 4 a.m., and because they didn\u2019t have credit cards, they had to use wads of cash to buy groceries.In 2005, Huawei also secured a deal with the European carrier Vodafone to sell about $1 million of gear. Even so, Mr. Scheuerle said, he was quickly given a new goal: Sell Vodafone $1 billion of equipment within three years. Huawei soon opened an office within steps of Vodafone\u2019s complex in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.\u201cWhen I left less than three years later, we were at $850 million \u2014 we were almost there,\u201d Mr. Scheuerle said.Huawei moved other employees from China to help in Europe, and hired many non-Chinese employees. It was a jarring cultural change for newcomers unfamiliar with Huawei\u2019s blunt management style; Mr. Scheuerle said staff emails criticized people by name for unsatisfactory work.Mr. Scheuerle held workshops for new employees to help them adapt to the company. He advised them to befriend Chinese colleagues with better knowledge of what was happening at Huawei headquarters in Shenzhen.Today, 12,000 of Huawei\u2019s 180,000 employees are in Europe, up from 7,300 in 2013. The company has vowed to hire nearly 3,000 more by next year. In 2017, it earned more than $20 billion in revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, roughly a quarter of its total business.Even when American officials warned allies of Huawei\u2019s risks, the company largely deflected the concerns. It opened a testing center where British officials inspected its products. It opened 23 research and development facilities in 14 European countries, and supported work at more than 150 universities. The company also hosts government officials and business leaders from Europe at its Shenzhen headquarters.In 2011, Huawei created the board to oversee operations in Britain. In reality, the group has a limited view of Huawei\u2019s inner workings and few responsibilities beyond quarterly meetings and attending some corporate events such as annual summer and winter parties, two people familiar with its activities said.Huawei said the board had legal responsibilities of directors overseeing compliance with laws, health and safety, and potential abuses of power.Now, as criticism mounts, Huawei is meeting with customers and government officials to assuage concerns. This includes allowing German officials to inspect its engineering and code.Next month at the mobile tech conference MWC Barcelona, formerly the Mobile World Congress, Huawei plans to announce new handsets and provide an update of its 5G plans. A new advertising campaign is also in the works, the company said."}, {"title": "World Leaders at Davos Call for Global Rules on Tech", "category": "Business", "id": "ef8f14e2-8e7c-4afe-ba98-0a043e966ee1", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/technology/world-economic-forum-data-controls.html", "publishdate": 20190123, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/24/business/24TECHRULES01/merlin_149622171_39cffa56-dbd1-4dda-b764-22c407e2e4c4-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "DAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Leaders of Japan, South Africa, China and Germany issued a series of calls on Wednesday for global oversight of the tech sector, in a clear signal of growing international interest in seizing greater regulatory supervision of an industry led by the United States.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said his country would use its chairmanship of the Group of 20 nations this year to push forward a new international system for the oversight of how data is used. Data governance will be the theme when the group\u2019s presidents and prime ministers gather in June in Osaka for their annual summit meeting.The emphasis will be on expanding World Trade Organization rules to encompass trade in data as well as goods and services, he said. \u201cI would like Osaka G20 to be long remembered as the summit that started worldwide data governance,\u201d Mr. Abe said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.Mr. Abe\u2019s proposal was echoed in remarks by other world leaders at the forum. President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said greater oversight of the tech sector would also be on the agenda of African Union leaders when they meet early next month in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\u201cWhen it comes to technology, I would support an overarching body that\u2019ll set standards on a whole range of things,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa said in an interview, specifically mentioning cybersecurity as a priority.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany called in a speech for a \u201ccommon digital market\u201d in the European Union. She said international oversight of data usage was needed to head off opposition to the entire tech sector from those who fear the current pace of technological change.Speaking after Ms. Merkel, Vice President Wang Qishan of China also cited a need for more international coordination in oversight of the tech sector, but did not mention personal privacy. In what appeared to be an oblique reference to the Chinese government\u2019s close ties to that country\u2019s tech sector, which involves extensive surveillance of civil society, Mr. Wang emphasized that each country should also be free to set some of its own policies.\u201cWe need to respect the independent choices of model of technology management and of public policies made by countries, and their right to participate in the global technological governance system as equals,\u201d said Mr. Wang.The remarks by the four leaders did not appear to represent a coordinated effort to push forward a new international architecture for oversight of the tech sector. Nor were they consistent in citing which tech sectors might merit further international rules.There was no consensus on what a global architecture might look like.The United States has largely deferred to the tech behemoths of Silicon Valley, which have favored some kind of international understanding among governments on data standards, but want those standards to impose few restrictions on how companies use that data.European governments have advocated much greater limits on how companies can use data, notably through the European Union\u2019s imposition last May of strict data privacy rules, the General Data Protection Regulation.China has not accepted any limits on the government\u2019s ability to access people\u2019s personal information. The Chinese government has wide access to electronic communications and employs indoor and outdoor facial recognition and other monitoring and people-tracking technology.The rapid spread of digital technology in daily life and the implications that has on the future of work and data security will require more international cooperation, not less, Ms. Merkel said. But she acknowledged that nobody knows how to write the rules.Neither the American nor the Chinese approach would work for Europeans, who place a high value on privacy and social justice, Ms. Merkel said.\u201cI still have yet to see any global architecture that deals with these questions,\u201d she said.Mr. Abe said Japan wanted to move fast on data governance during its leadership this year of the Group of 20. But he provided only a general indication of what a new architecture might look like.\u201cWe must, on one hand, be able to put our personal data and data embodying intellectual property, national security intelligence, and so on, under careful protection, while on the other hand, we must enable the free flow of medical, industrial, traffic and other most useful, non-personal, anonymous data to see no borders, repeat, no borders,\u201d he said.Mr. Abe suggested that the world look for a way to broaden W.T.O. rules. The W.T.O. already regulates some kinds of telecommunications services as part of its rule-setting for international trade in goods and services.Chancellor Merkel of Germany specifically listed the need for ethical standards in artificial intelligence and genetic engineering, and the handling and ownership of data, as three areas that would require particular attention. An announcement by a Chinese doctor that he had edited the genes of a human baby has stirred international interest in genetic engineering. China has quickly shut down the medical program that produced the baby and the doctor himself has been put under guard at a guesthouse at his university in southeastern China.Europe, and Germany in particular, have emerged as the de facto regulators of the technology sector, exerting influence beyond their own borders. Berlin\u2019s digital crackdown on hate speech, which took effect last year, is being closely watched by other countries.But if the Continent wanted to continue to take a leading role in shaping international data standards, it would also have to become \u201can important actor\u201d in the industry itself, Ms. Merkel said.Africa presents further issues for designing any global system for the oversight of data or for the tech sector overall. It has emerged as a tech Wild West, with very few rules, varying by country.With lavish financing from state-owned Chinese banks under President Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese telecommunications companies like Huawei and ZTE have been building extensive mobile phone and data switching networks across Africa. Privacy issues are starting to surface in Africa as well.Mr. Ramaphosa said the African Union needed to act in concert with the international community.\u201cAfrica as a whole should for itself begin to see whether there should be standards that we should all adhere to so that, in the end, we do not have an exclusive type of architecture, which excludes smaller countries, less well-endowed countries financially,\u201d he said in the interview.The Trump administration has imposed increasing restrictions on exports of tech products to China. The administration has also sought to discourage countries around the world from buying telecommunications equipment from Huawei, particularly for advanced 5G mobile communications networks. It has suggested that Huawei may be linked to Chinese intelligence and to the shipments of American gear to Iran in violation of United States sanctions. Huawei has denied these claims.Canada has detained the chief financial officer of Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, in response to a warrant from the United States. The Trump administration is preparing to make a formal extradition request for Ms. Meng within the next week.Vice President Wang appeared to push back against the United States\u2019 overall stance on tech issues.\u201cIt is imperative to respect national sovereignty and refrain from seeking technological hegemony, interfering in other countries\u2019 domestic affairs and conducting, shielding or protecting technology-enabled activities that undermine other countries\u2019 national security,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "He Reported on Facebook.

Nick Confessore, an investigative reporter, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You\u2019ve written a lot about data privacy and the misuse of people\u2019s online data. How do you protect your own data privacy in your work?I\u2019m not a privacy expert, just a normal person who has done some reporting on how tech platforms handle personal data. So the answer is: I protect my privacy as well as I can \u2014 which is not very well. Most of the ecosystem of mobile phones and apps, as well as the advertising technology that permeates the mobile and desktop web, is designed to extract a large amount of your personal information. The whole thing is effectively unregulated and almost impossible to escape without a fair amount of planning and technical expertise.I use an iPhone, because Apple has some reasonable tech in place to protect your privacy. (Android phones, running Google\u2019s operating system, are voracious and arguably unscrupulous collectors of information about their owners; an Android phone with Chrome open sends your location back to Google about 300 times a day, according to one study.) I\u2019ve turned off location tracking for almost all of the apps I use, and I\u2019ve tried to limit what Google apps I have on my iPhone.For search, I mostly use DuckDuckGo, a privacy-optimized search engine that chooses not to collect or save certain kinds of data about the people who use it. I use a browser plug-in from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital civil rights group, called Privacy Badger, which tells me when a site I visit is letting third parties look over its shoulder at what I\u2019m doing.Despite my in-house lamentations, The Times uses Gmail for its corporate email services, which means I have both a personal and a business Gmail account. I also use the Chrome browser on a PC desktop, because I found other browsers were less stable. (I\u2019m thinking of going back to Firefox.)ImageMr. Confessore has tried to limit the  Google apps he uses. For example, DuckDuckGo has become his go-to alternative for search.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesSo what do I do? Whatever I can. In my privacy settings, I\u2019ve turned off \u2014 or \u201cpaused\u201d \u2014 all of the Google services associated with my Gmail accounts that track me or collect my data. I never sign into another website or service using my Facebook account, a feature Facebook has used to track its users\u2019 browsing activities off the Facebook platform. I\u2019ve tweaked all the privacy settings on Facebook and other services that I can find.For all that, I have no doubt that a true privacy expert reading this article will laugh at all the things I\u2019m missing. And that\u2019s kind of the point: In the United States, and in some other countries, the deck is stacked against consumers.Have you changed your use of social media after writing about some of the data practices of Facebook? When I started reporting on Big Tech, a lot of the public criticism about social media focused on Twitter, a relatively small platform that happens to be popular among the American political and journalistic elite. Two years later, a lot of the criticism focuses on Facebook and Google \u2014 and Twitter is by far the social media platform I use the most.That\u2019s partly because I don\u2019t find the Facebook experience all that engaging or fun. But partly it\u2019s for security. Once I started reporting deeply on Facebook, I deleted all Facebook-owned apps from my phone, including Instagram. I don\u2019t know exactly who has access to the data those apps collect, but while meeting with confidential sources, I don\u2019t want to risk that an app on my phone might be sending Facebook my location.The social media app I really miss is Instagram. I always had a private account, and I accept requests only from real-life friends and family. So it\u2019s an ocean of sanity and genuine relationships compared with Twitter, which is a hell of random angry people. But when I log in \u2014 once or twice a week at most, usually on my wife\u2019s phone \u2014 I\u2019m now hyper-conscious that every like, thumb click and scroll may go into my permanent Facebook record.Is deleting Facebook an effective way to protect privacy?Not in the slightest. It may interfere with Facebook\u2019s ability to track you as a consumer. But almost every website you visit or app you have on your phone is to some extent tracking where you go and what you do. ImageA telescoping back scratcher in the coffee mug is \"the most important tool of all.\"CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesDeleting Facebook may not even stop Facebook. Kashmir Hill at Gizmodo has written about \u201cshadow profiles\u201d \u2014 dossiers that Facebook builds about people using information it culls from the inboxes and cellphones of their friends, work colleagues and acquaintances. Facebook may know a lot about you even if you never open a Facebook account.What are some of the tech tools of the trade for an investigative reporter? I don\u2019t do anything really elaborate. The main thing I do differently is conduct virtually all of my sensitive work communication over Signal, the encrypted messaging app. It\u2019s an easy way to have reasonably safe conversations with sources who need protection. When I write about politics and campaigns, I rely on in-house data tools to query federal data on campaign contributions and expenditures. (Hat tip to Rachel Shorey, Chase Davis, Jeremy Bowers and many other colleagues.) I\u2019ve also used tools at the National Institute on Money in Politics, which maintains a database that covers state-by-state lobbying and campaign finance. I also love a site called Citizen Audit, which provides searchable copies of the tax returns for nonprofit organizations. It\u2019s basically Google for \u201cdark money.\u201d More recently, I\u2019ve come to rely on LinkedIn. When you\u2019re writing about companies, it is an invaluable way to track down former employees who might be potential sources. People at companies will often describe in their LinkedIn profiles particular projects they worked on, products they developed or initiatives that the company conducted \u2014 often information that is otherwise not public.ImageAmong his apps, LinkedIn has helped Mr. Confessore investigate stories by leading him to former employees who became sources.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesThe most important tool of all? A telescoping back scratcher that I got at a store called Flying Tiger. I keep it in my pencil mug, and it is awesome.If you could invent a product to help people protect their online privacy, what would it be?I\u2019m going to answer this one the long way. The United States has no basic consumer privacy law. So every individual has to be in charge of navigating the entire commercial-surveillance-industrial-complex on his or her own. Which is to say, it\u2019s practically impossible for any nonexperts to protect their privacy in a meaningful way. The privacy expert Ashkan Soltani, whom I\u2019ve quoted in some stories, compares it to ordering a cup of coffee at a Starbucks and being told that the coffee may be loaded with arsenic, but that it\u2019s up to you to figure out whether or not the coffee is safe to drink.I\u2019ve come to the view that no effective privacy-protection product is really possible without clearer \u2014 and probably more stringent \u2014 laws governing what data companies are allowed to collect and what rights I have to control my own information. If such laws did come into play, it would open the door to interesting private-sector privacy solutions. For example, California recently passed a law allowing consumers to \u201copt out\u201d of many kinds of online and offline data collection. With such a law in place, new businesses can sell subscription services that would, for a fee, do all the opting out for you.Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love to use and why?We\u2019re a pretty analog family. Aside from the requisite phones, laptops and iPad, I don\u2019t have a lot of gear. Most of the gadgets we do have I don\u2019t actually like.Sonos is a great-sounding speaker with an inexplicably unwieldy user interface that makes me want to throw my phone out the window. (Hey, Sonos, why can\u2019t I just play my songs directly from my phone\u2019s Music app?) The Nest learning thermostats never seem to actually learn anything. (Also, the Nests give Google the equivalent of a couple of cameras in my home.)Image\"Hey, Sonos, why can\u2019t I just play my songs directly from my phone\u2019s Music app?\"CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesI\u2019ve shied away from voice-activated speakers like Amazon Echo. I find these devices extremely creepy. For now, the only such device in my home is in my older daughter\u2019s room. She really, really wanted a Google Home.I have a few guitars and a nice big tube amplifier that I never get to turn on, because it\u2019s New York, I live in an apartment and I want my neighbors to like me. We cook a lot but don\u2019t have an Instant Pot.

They asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the matter. The cuts will affect the international and web content departments, including the news division.Mr. Peretti sent a note to employees at 6:30 p.m. Eastern time with the subject line \u201cDifficult Changes.\u201d\u201cHello BuzzFeeders,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m writing with sad news: we are doing layoffs at BuzzFeed next week. We will be making a 15% overall reduction in headcount across the company. I\u2019m sending this tonight because I wanted you to hear it from me directly instead of from the press.\u201dThe move is meant to trim costs and maintain growth as the company aims to hit profitability this year. BuzzFeed, which employs over 1,300 people, generated more than $300 million in revenue in 2018. That was a jump of better than 15 percent from the previous year, but the company still loses money.[UPDATE: BuzzFeed\u2019s first round of layoffs puts an end to its national news desk.]Known for its mastery of the viral arts, the site relies on an army of editors, producers and journalists to produce thousands of pieces of content each week, as varied as cooking videos and breaking news reports.BuzzFeed News, a money-losing division of the company led by the editor Ben Smith, came under scrutiny in recent days after publishing an article reporting that President Trump had instructed his former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie in his testimony to Congress. In a rare public statement, the special counsel\u2019s office denied the report. Mr. Smith has said he stands by the article.Digital publishers have suffered as shifting reader habits and whimsical-seeming algorithm adjustments at Facebook have cut into revenue. Vice Media reduced staff last year in a bid to reach profits. Mic, a site aimed at younger readers, cut the majority of its staff before being sold off in a fire sale to a competitor. And on Wednesday CNN Business reported that Verizon Media Group, which includes Yahoo, AOL and HuffPost, plans to reduce its staff by 7 percent \u2014 a cut of some 800 employees.Advertisers generally pay less to reach online readers than print devotees, but investors were banking on the idea that online ad rates would significantly rise and digital publishers would dominate. That hasn\u2019t happened as Facebook and Google continue to siphon off the majority of ad dollars.BuzzFeed\u2019s board recently agreed that the company needs to start turning profits, the people said. The site has lost money for most of the years it has been in operation, not unusual for a start-up. Venture-backed companies like BuzzFeed often spend big at first in a bid to expand. But as the company closes in on a decade in business, investors are losing patience.In his note, Mr. Peretti said, \u201cThe restructuring we are undertaking will reduce our costs and improve our operating model so we can thrive and control our own destiny, without ever needing to raise funding again. These changes will allow us to be the clear winner in the market as the economics of digital media continue to improve.\u201dImageJonah Peretti, the chief executive of BuzzFeed, in 2016 in what was to become the publisher\u2019s new expanded newsroom in New York.CreditCole Wilson for The New York TimesBuzzFeed has raised nearly $500 million in venture funding, with $400 million coming from NBCUniversal.Mr. Peretti, a graduate of the M.I.T. Media Lab and a founder of HuffPost, started BuzzFeed in 2006 as a something of an experiment to see whether his team could create content that readers were eager to share on social media. It became a genuine business by 2011 and amassed a large following by hitting on a formula that took advantage of the new publishing platforms on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. BuzzFeed\u2019s monthly readership is nothing to LOL at: 690 million, a figure that has made it the envy of the web.That still may not be enough. BuzzFeed took a hit when Facebook introduced a sweeping change in 2016 that significantly reduced the visibility of articles and videos from professional publishers in its News Feed, its main artery of content. The change hurt all content companies \u2014 including Vox Media, Refinery29 and Group Nine, the publisher of popular sites like The Dodo \u2014 and forced them to adjust their strategies to rely less on platforms like Facebook.In a November interview with The New York Times, Mr. Peretti proffered an audacious solution: a series of mergers with five or six top internet publishers, including Vice, Vox Media, Group Nine and Refinery.The industrial logic was evident, he said. A larger entity could lobby for a higher percentage of the ad dollars that Facebook and Google share with publishers when their content, videos in particular, run on the platforms. In turn, publishers would be able to supply them with content that is safe for general users and friendlier for advertisers.\u201cHaving some bigger companies that actually care about the quality of the content feels like something that\u2019s very valuable,\u201d he said at the time.In an effort to add more revenue streams, BuzzFeed has started new business lines, offering a cookware line at Walmart and a toy store in Manhattan. It also started placing banner ads across its website. That represented a change of course for Mr. Peretti, who once said he didn\u2019t want banner ads, because they significantly slowed down the site. In their place he pushed for native ads \u2014 posts that look like editorial content but are created in cooperation with marketers.Native advertising slowed considerably in 2017, however. Coupled with changes at Facebook, the rate of revenue growth declined. The addition of banner ads significantly added to BuzzFeed\u2019s coffers last year, the people said.In his note to the staff, Mr. Peretti said he took the layoffs to heart.\u201cOn a personal note,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve never thought about my job as \u2018just business.\u2019 I care about the people at BuzzFeed more than anything other than my family. This will be a tough week for all of us and I realize it will be much worse for the people losing their jobs. To them, I want to say thank you, I\u2019m sorry our work together is ending this way, and I hope we get to work together again in the future. Our loss will be to the benefit of other organizations where I know you will go on to make formidable contributions.\u201dBuzzFeed has had staff reductions in the past. In 2017, it cut 100 of its 1,600-employee work force after it failed to meet revenue targets that year.As BuzzFeed looks to cut down its staff once again during a difficult period for web media companies, traditional publishers have also struggled. Gannett, the owner of USA Today and The Detroit Free Press, has cut its work force sharply over the past few years. A company overview from the end of 2015 showed 19,600 employees. By the end of 2017, the figure was down to 15,300.On Wednesday, there were more layoffs at Gannett newspapers across the country, including The Indianapolis Star and The Record in New Jersey. The company is slimming down in an effort to shore up its shrinking profits. Separately, a company controlled by the New York hedge fund Alden Global Capital \u2014 which itself has made drastic cuts at newspapers in its stable, including The Denver Post \u2014 has expressed interest."}, {"title": "Pete Buttigieg, Mayor of South Bend, Ind., Joins Democratic 2020 Race", "category": "Politics", "id": "b70df5e1-8367-4a53-b4c0-3ed8b38be3d9", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-mayor-south-bend-president.html", "publishdate": 20190123, "imageurl": "", "content": "Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., announced on Wednesday that he was entering the Democratic presidential primary, embarking on a long-shot campaign that may test the appeal of a youthful, Midwestern profile over more traditional qualifications for the presidency.In an email to potential supporters, Mr. Buttigieg (he pronounces it BOOT-edge-edge) said he was forming an exploratory committee and cast himself as a candidate of the future, stressing his generational identity and calling for policies \u201cuntethered to the politics of the past\u201d on issues like climate and economic opportunity.\u201cWhat will America look like in 2054, when I reach the age of the current president?\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cHow will we look back on 2020?\u201d[Follow the Democratic presidential field with our new candidate tracker]He also released an introductory video.A veteran of the war in Afghanistan, Mr. Buttigieg was a consultant at McKinsey before entering politics.It is unclear whether a municipal executive who oversees a city of about 100,000 people can be a viable candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.

He added that negotiations would only be successful if the Chinese honored their commitments:\u201cPromises are great but enforcement is what we want \u2014 things like deadlines and timetables and full coverage of the various structural issues. Will this all be solved at the end of the month? I don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t dare to predict.\u201dChina may agree to buy up to seven million tons of American wheat. But Chinese officials are reportedly chafing at U.S. requests for regular reviews of changes to their trade policies. And two influential American business groups still see reason to be unhappy, saying China is engaged in \u201ca deep, concerted and continuing effort\u201d to establish dominance in technologies such as robotics and electric vehicles.Beijing is also trying to play down Belt and Road, its vast infrastructure initiative spanning Asia, Europe and Africa: Senior government officials have avoided the topic at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the NYT reports.The effects of trade tensions continue to spread. The stock market started the year strong but sputtered on Tuesday. Japan\u2019s exports last month sank the most in more than two years. Chinese finance officials promised more stimulus. Experts are predicting that \u201cthe good times are over\u201d for American companies reliant on Chinese consumers.But not everyone is complaining: Lobbyists have enjoyed a surge of business from companies and trade groups hoping to influence the Trump administration\u2019s tariff decisions. Indonesia\u2019s doing all right, too: Its industry minister says it\u2019s exporting more steel to the U.S. and also attracting Chinese textile and footwear companies.Other Chinese news: The founder of a Nanjing-based meat supplier, one of several Chinese executives at Hong Kong-listed companies who have mysteriously disappeared in recent years, returned to his family.

One involves President Trump\u2019s latest proposal: $5.7 billion for a border wall, now accompanied by temporary protections for certain immigrants. The other, from the Democrats, would open the government until Feb. 8.But neither is expected to draw the 60 votes needed to advance. This means that the Trump administration is likely to continue as a one-ring circus, focused on the wall to the exclusion of other presidential duties.Here are ways the shutdown is still straining the system:\u2022 Reserve security workers are being flown into airports, because as many as one in 10 transportation security officers are failing to show up for work.\u2022 Delays in reports about home sales, construction, trade and manufacturing threaten to create a data vacuum, just as the economy may be slowing down.\u2022 SNAP food stamps help feed some 40 million Americans.

Think about the digital junk we hoard, like the tens of thousands of photos bloating our smartphones or the backlog of files cluttering our computer drives, such as old work presentations, expense receipts and screenshots we have not opened in years.In addition to the digital mess, tech hardware adds to the pile of junk that sparks no joy in our lives. Everyone has a drawer full of ancient cellphones, tangled-up wires and earphones that are never touched. And the things we do use every day, like charging cables strewn around the house, are an eyesore.Why are people so terrible about tech hoarding? Cary Fortin, a professional organizer for the company New Minimalism, summed it up: \u201cWe don\u2019t really think about the cost of holding on to things, but we think about the cost of needing it one day and not having it.\u201dDon\u2019t fret, dear reader. As a technology critic who tests dozens of gadgets a year, I\u2019m in a unique position of having to wrestle with extraordinary amounts of tech products and accessories every day. (Last year, I brought nine new smartphones, two tablets, four smart speakers and 14 power accessories into my home.) So here\u2019s a guide to tidying up your technology physically and digitally, including tips from professional organizers.How to declutter your power cablesThe No. 1 culprit of tech clutter in every household, professional organizers say, is the power cable. Part of the problem is that we typically need different wires for products like smartphones, battery packs, cameras and laptops. These then accumulates into one tangled mess. Here\u2019s how to solve power cable overpopulation in a few simple steps:Gather them all together and purge the ones you don\u2019t need. This sounds easier said than done, but here\u2019s a good rule of thumb: \u201cIf you don\u2019t know what it goes to, get rid of it,\u201d said Marissa Hagmeyer, an organization consultant and co-owner of Neat Method. Among the wires you keep, if there are extras, cap them at two, such as two Micro USB cables, she said. In the process, you may end up discarding a wire that you later need. But don\u2019t beat yourself up. \u201cYou can buy a new one if it turns out you needed it,\u201d Ms. Fortin said. That\u2019s better than wasting space on something you might hypothetically need.The same approach can be applied to other tech gadgets, like the obsolete smartphone that is living in your sock drawer. If you haven\u2019t used it for six months, get rid of it. Unwanted tech accessories and gadgets can be discarded responsibly through donation centers or e-recycling programs like Best Buy\u2019s.Have a designated place for all your tech accessories. Pick somewhere in your home where your various wires will live, like a closet, cabinet or drawer. From there, categorize the wires and give them compartments. I separate my different types of wires \u2014 earbuds, phone chargers, miscellaneous USB cables and computer chargers \u2014 into Ziploc bags and label them with a label maker. All the bags live in a drawer in my TV stand.There are different approaches to organizing your power cables. Families with children could give each member a compartment. For example, put your son Joe\u2019s iPhone charger, laptop charger and earbuds into one Ziploc bag and label it \u201cJoe\u2019s tech.\u201dThis step is a must. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a dedicated place for your items, then you\u2019re wasting your time finding them,\u201d said Keith Bartolomei, a professional organizer for Zen Habitat.Hide wires that live out in the open. Even if you find a place to stash your spare cables, you probably have a few left plugged in all day. To tidy them up, there are methods to hide the wires or, at the very least, keep them off the floor.Mr. Bartolomei recommends using twisty wires and rubber bands to keep wires wrapped around furniture, like desk legs. There are also products for bundling up and concealing wires, like fabric sleeves or boxes that cover your surge protector. My approach to keeping wires off the ground is to run them through magnetic buckles that clip onto a metal side table.How to resist digital hoardingImageMinh Uong/The New York TimesCreditMinh Uong/The New York TimesTidying up your digital media may not feel worthwhile because your files are not visible in the real world. Yet holding on to all the data takes up valuable space on devices while also making important files more difficult to find. The professionals recommended a process of purging and labeling what\u2019s left. Here\u2019s how it would work:Do an annual clearance of the files you no longer need. To streamline this process on a computer, open a folder and sort the files by when they were last opened. From there, you can immediately eliminate the files you have not opened in years.On your smartphone, prune unnecessary apps that are taking up space. On iPhones, Apple offers the tool iPhone Storage, which shows a list of apps that take up the most data and when they were last used; on Android devices, Google offers a similar tool called Files. From here, you can home in on the data hogs and delete the apps you have not touched in months.Manage your enormous photo library. Eradicating photos is the most challenging process, the professional organizers agreed, because the thought of deleting your memories may be painful. But photos are some of the biggest data hogs of all, so some periodic maintenance is crucial.Start by trimming out the easy ones: duplicate photos, blurry shots and old screenshots.Then move on to the harder part: deleting the photos that were decent but not your favorites. Mr. Bartolomei said people could look at each photo and ask themselves a few questions: \u201cIs this something you want to see again? Does it make you happy? Do you want to spend more time with this photo in the future?\u201d If you answer no to any of those questions, the photo can probably go in the trash bin.My approach to managing digital photos is to purge everything without doing any organization at all. I use Google Photos, which automatically backs each shot to the cloud, compiles photos into albums and includes a tool for removing images from the device. (I also back up all my photos to an external drive in case I ever become unhappy with Google Photos.) Then I erase all the photos from my iPhone every six months and pay Google $2 a month to manage thousands of my photos at full resolution. Whatever approach you take, don\u2019t skimp on tidying up your data. Even if it doesn\u2019t use up physical room, it can still cause you harm.\u201cIt takes up so much psychic space and brings up the same negative effect: anxiety,\u201d Ms. Fortin said. \u201cSince we all have our phones in our pockets, we\u2019re toting our clutter around with us.\u201dRelated coverage Five Resolutions to Simplify Your Tech LifeDec. 28, 2016How to Clean Your Filthy, Disgusting LaptopJune 26, 2018What to Do if You Spill on Your LaptopJune 29, 2018Zen and the Art of Managing Smartphone PhotosJune 1, 2016How to Sell or Recycle Old ElectronicsDec. 2, 2015"}, {"title": "Lessons for Corporate Boardrooms From Yahoo\u2019s Cybersecurity Settlement", "category": "Business", "id": "7142d822-640e-45ac-bf5f-f53cce4da475", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/business/dealbook/yahoo-cyber-security-settlement.html", "publishdate": 20190123, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/24/business/24db-anotherview1/merlin_145729827_d360a55e-f58f-4ad1-927c-38bdb50b6b06-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________Shareholders haven\u2019t been successful in holding companies accountable for data breaches.That changed in the first month of 2019.The former officers and directors of Yahoo agreed to pay $29 million to settle charges that they breached their fiduciary duties in their handling of customer data during a series of cyberattacks from 2013 until 2016. Three billion Yahoo user accounts were compromised in the attacks. The settlement ended three so-called derivative lawsuits filed in Delaware and California against the company\u2019s former leadership team and board, including Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s former chief executive. Insurance coverage will pick up the tab.The settlement, approved this month by a Superior Court judge in Santa Clara, Calif., marked the first time that shareholders have been awarded a monetary damages in a derivative lawsuit related to a data breach. There have been very few breach-related derivative lawsuits, and all had been dismissed by the courts or settled without a payment to the shareholders.A derivative lawsuit is a legal mechanism that gives the owners of a company \u2014 the shareholders \u2014 a way to hold corporate directors and management accountable for their actions. Shareholders file a claim on the company\u2019s behalf, with any money recovered going to the corporation, not the individual shareholders, because the violation harmed only the organization.Under the Yahoo settlement, the lawyers walk away with about $11 million in fees and expenses, with the remaining $18 million paid to Yahoo, now called Altaba after Verizon acquired Yahoo\u2019s internet business in 2017.A $29 million settlement might seem trivial for a company that has a market capitalization of $38 billion. But it signals that director and officer liability for cybersecurity oversight is entering new and potentially perilous territory. That is especially so in cases like Yahoo\u2019s, in which shareholders allege egregious misconduct at the highest levels of an organization.Those allegations might explain why the Yahoo case was settled.Insurers don\u2019t typically cough up tens of millions of dollars to settle derivative cases, which can be tough for shareholders to win. They must show that board members breached their fiduciary responsibilities by consciously disregarding their duties. The chief justice of the Delaware Supreme Court has called these claims \u201cpossibly the most difficult theory in corporation law upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment.\u201dThe parties jointly told the court that the settlement was fair, in the best interest of all parties, and that a series of data security improvements have been worked out to minimize the chances that this will happen again. But the facts of the case most likely led the insurers to conclude that their exposure could be greater than the settlement.The reason is that the actions alleged in the lawsuit are outrageous. The nearly 120-page complaint \u2014 which is heavily redacted \u2014 reads at points more like a criminal indictment than a lawsuit. It accuses Yahoo\u2019s former leaders of engaging in an elaborate, yearslong plot to cover up hacks going back to 2013 and conducting a \u201csham\u201d investigation to \u201cconceal the largest hacking incident in U.S. history.\u201dYahoo was a pioneer of the internet era, and the core of its business was providing ways for users to communicate with one another confidentially. Yet Yahoo failed miserably at this fundamental mission, according to the shareholders\u2019 complaint. The expectations for consumer privacy and data security are far different for an internet company than a corner hardware store. The insurance carriers clearly understood this fact.The company\u2019s settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in April provided further fodder to justify a settlement. The S.E.C. tagged Altaba with a $35 million penalty for failing to make a timely disclosure of the data breach, the commission\u2019s first action for a cybersecurity disclosure violation.But it\u2019s the details of the S.E.C. settlement that most likely proved the most troubling for the insurers. According to the S.E.C., \u201cIn late 2014, Yahoo had learned of a massive breach of its user database that resulted in the theft, unauthorized access or acquisition of hundreds of millions of its user\u2019s personal data.\u201d The agency further alleged that \u201cYahoo senior management and relevant legal staff did not properly assess the scope, business impact or legal implications of the breach\u201d and \u201cdid not share information regarding the breach with Yahoo\u2019s auditors or outside counsel.\u201dYahoo didn\u2019t disclose the breach until September 2016, when it was negotiating the sale of its internet business to Verizon. Although the transaction was completed, the acquisition price was lowered by $350 million to $4.48 billion. That made for bad optics, a fact that the insurers probably recognized.Any company that figured it had little to fear from shareholders after a breach should now think twice. And in the meantime, this is definitely not the time to cut back insurance for officers and directors."}, {"title": "On Politics: Senate Offers Glimmer of Hope for End to Shutdown", "category": "Politics", "id": "d6a42537-b828-40ae-9dcb-1ffae9c23c55", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/us/politics/senate-shutdown-vote.html", "publishdate": 20190123, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Wednesday morning.

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.When people talk about the emerging 2020 Democratic primary field, it can sound an awful lot like the opening lines of a children\u2019s book.One candidate, two candidates Old candidates, new candidatesSome are slightly left, some are farSay! what a lot of candidates there are.ImageCreditManuel Balce Ceneta/Associated PressBut there\u2019s one thing many leading Democrats seem to agree on: Kamala Harris is a formidable contender. When you ask 2020 candidates, likely candidates and members of their teams what possible opponent they worry about, the California senator\u2019s name comes up frequently.Those concerns only grew on Monday when Ms. Harris formally announced her presidential bid: She matched Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s record by raising $1.5 million from 38,000 donors in the first 24 hours of her campaign.So why is a first-term senator, with little experience outside California state government, making Democrats so nervous?\u2022 She doesn\u2019t fit into a neat ideological lane. As my colleague Astead Herndon wrote on Monday, Ms. Harris comes out of the Bay Area\u2019s Democratic establishment. But since joining the Senate in 2017, she\u2019s embraced elements of a Sanders-lite liberal agenda, backing \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and rejecting most corporate donations. As a result, her team argues, she can appeal to a wide array of factions in the party.\u2022 She would make history. Should she prevail in the primary season, Ms. Harris would be the first African-American woman and the first person of Asian heritage to be a major party nominee. As a graduate of Howard and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the oldest black sorority, Ms. Harris has deep ties to the black community.\u2022 The primary map favors a candidate who can win strong support from black voters \u2014 and California. It\u2019s no accident that Ms. Harris is making her first campaign stop on Friday in South Carolina, where African-Americans will likely make up a majority of the electorate in that state\u2019s early primary. The rising popularity of early voting also means that primary voters will start casting ballots in her native state of California on the day of the Iowa caucuses; in diverse states of Illinois and Ohio, voters can start casting early ballots before New Hampshire holds its primary.After Iowa and New Hampshire, the race moves to potentially favorable terrain for Ms. Harris: Nevada, which borders California and has a large Latino population, then South Carolina. Then, on Super Tuesday, California will be among the states voting, as will four southern states where black voters made up more than a quarter of the 2016 primary electorate.Even with these advantages, Ms. Harris still has plenty to worry about. Already, she\u2019s fending off attacks on the \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d positions she took as a prosecutor in California. In her first remarks after announcing her campaign, Ms. Harris described the criminal justice system as \u201chorribly flawed.\u201d And her liberal bona fides may be found lacking by an insurgent wing that is ascendant in the party.Obviously Ms. Harris does not have anything locked down. (Need I take you back to the winter of 2007, when Hillary Clinton led primary polls by double digits.) We\u2019re in the early stages of what will likely be a very, very long primary contest. A lot can happen.Just ask Howard Dean.____________________Talking Points for Biden 2020?Advisers to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are circulating a document to his supporters that outlines a rationale for him to run for president and rebuts potential lines of attack \u2014 the latest indication that Mr. Biden is leaning toward a 2020 bid but has not yet fully committed.The talking points, which were sent to The Times\u2019s Jonathan Martin by an ally of Mr. Biden, reflect some of his core arguments he would make if he does enter the Democratic primary. He and his advisers contend that his long experience in politics \u2014 he served in the Senate for over 35 years \u2014 would represent an appealing contrast to President Trump\u2019s erratic style.\u201cIn a time of almost unprecedented political chaos under a President whose first and last thought every day is about himself, his image, and using the most powerful office in the world to enrich himself, Americans are reacting to \u2014 and looking for \u2014 the trustworthy, compassionate leadership that Joe Biden has brought to the national and international stage his entire career,\u201d the document states.But what is more revealing about the 10-paragraph document is that Mr. Biden and his small circle of aides feel the need to sketch out his message before he announces his candidacy. It is, a Biden ally said, \u201ca distillation of his thinking.\u201d The decision to put these thoughts on paper while other Democrats are announcing full-blown campaigns indicates Mr. Biden is still eager to gauge reaction to his candidacy before taking the plunge.To that end, the talking points attempt to grapple with some of the most frequent critiques of Mr. Biden:\u2022 That his initial lead in some Democratic primary polls is simply based on name identification and will melt once other candidates become better known?\u201cHe is passionate, he is empathetic, he is trustworthy \u2014 and voters know these things about him,\u201d the document states. \u201cIt\u2019s why he\u2019s atop so many polls \u2014 it\u2019s not because voters know his name, it\u2019s because they know his character.\u201d\u2022 That he is too moderate for today\u2019s Democratic voters and will struggle with liberals?\u201cHe was outspoken on LGBTQ rights even when every pundit around said that it was a political mistake,\u201d according to the talking points, adding that he also sought to address climate change early in his career and is an unwavering ally of organized labor.\u2022 At 76, Mr. Biden may be too old to run for president?He campaigned for nearly 70 candidates, across the ideological spectrum, \u201cacross 26 states in the last two years.\u201dStay tuned, folks.____________________Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers.

More videos later emerged that complicated the story, showing the encounter had been preceded by African-American protesters, who identified themselves as Hebrew Israelites, shouting slurs at the students.The incident has emerged as a kind of Rorschach test for views on politics, race and the Trump administration.We talked to Elizabeth Dias, The New York Times religion correspondent who was in Covington, about what she discovered about our political culture.Lisa: Why did this video touch such a nerve? Elizabeth: There are these flash points now in our political culture. This one was particularly polarizing because it touched every nerve \u2014 race, President Trump and the behavior of young white men.As a religion reporter, I\u2019ve covered a lot of sensitive topics and the level of vitriol and aggression from the right and the left about every part of this story is remarkable. Some of the people involved in the videos have been experiencing threats of violence all weekend. So what did you learn about the context for these videos? When you actually are on the ground, in the kids\u2019 community, you start to get an idea of the cultural context behind these kinds of inflamed moments. The school is in an overwhelmingly white, heavily Republican and Catholic area. The boys in the video, their school is known around town as the \u201cColonel Crazies\u201d for their intense school pride and their all-male brotherhood. And now the Catholic community and the parents of these kids are joining together to protect them.The last time the country was this intensely focused on Catholic high school boys was during the Kavanaugh hearings. This time we\u2019re seeing it in a pocket of the country that fueled Mr. Trump\u2019s election.And with the videos, there\u2019s now this fight over whose narrative wins out.What does this incident tell us about our political culture?So Covington, where this happened, is right across the river from Cincinnati. The Covington area voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, while the Cincinnati area has become increasingly blue. They are very close, but may have very different realities of what it is to be American.How have politicians tried to capitalize on this episode?Mr. Trump jumped into the fray praising the Covington Catholic boys and used the moment to attack the media. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the kids get a visit to Washington or the White House or even the State of the Union, if it happens. The right already sees this as part of their narrative \u2014 that Christians are under attack.____________________What to read tonight\u2022 Furloughed federal workers try to join the gig economy.

Biden Jr. swept into Benton Harbor, Mich., three weeks before the November elections, in the midst of his quest to reclaim the Midwest for Democrats. He took the stage at Lake Michigan College as Representative Fred Upton, a long-serving Republican from the area, faced the toughest race of his career.But Mr. Biden was not there to denounce Mr. Upton. Instead, he was collecting $200,000 from the Economic Club of Southwestern Michigan to address a Republican-leaning audience, according to a speaking contract obtained by The New York Times and interviews with organizers. The group, a business-minded civic organization, is supported in part by an Upton family foundation.Mr. Biden stunned Democrats and elated Republicans by praising Mr. Upton while the lawmaker looked on from the audience. Alluding to Mr. Upton\u2019s support for a landmark medical-research law, Mr. Biden called him a champion in the fight against cancer \u2014 and \u201cone of the finest guys I\u2019ve ever worked with.\u201dMr. Biden\u2019s remarks, coming amid a wide-ranging discourse on American politics, quickly appeared in Republican advertising. The local Democratic Party pleaded with Mr. Biden to repair what it saw as a damaging error, to no avail. On Nov. 6, Mr. Upton defeated his Democratic challenger by four and a half percentage points.As Mr. Biden considers a bid for the presidency in 2020, the episode underscores his potential vulnerabilities in a fight for the Democratic nomination and raises questions about his judgment as a party leader. Mr. Biden has attempted to strike a balance since leaving office, presenting himself as a unifying statesman who could unseat President Trump while also working to amass a modest fortune of several million dollars.But Mr. Biden\u2019s appearance in Michigan plainly set his lucrative personal activities at odds with what some Democrats saw as his duty to the party, linking him with a civic group seen as tilting to the right and undermining Democrats\u2019 effort to defeat Mr. Upton, a powerful lawmaker who in 2017 helped craft a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Eric Lester, a retired physician who chaired the Democratic Party in Berrien County, Mich., during the midterms, said he viewed Mr. Biden\u2019s supportive remarks about Mr. Upton as a betrayal. Mr. Lester, who attended the speech, said he had confronted an aide to Mr. Biden in the hallway, telling him the former vice president had badly damaged the Democratic cause.\u201cIt just gives Fred Upton cover and makes it possible for him to continue to pretend to be a useful, bipartisan fellow,\u201d Mr. Lester recalled saying, adding, \u201cI entered the hall with positive feelings about Mr. Biden and felt very frustrated.\u201dJoe Trippi, a Democratic strategist and veteran of several presidential campaigns, said it was an open question whether voters in the party would punish candidates they see as overly friendly or cooperative with Republicans. He suggested that could be one of the defining pressures for Mr. Biden if he announces his candidacy.\u201cI really believe the country does not want to be at war with each other,\u201d Mr. Trippi said. \u201cBut there is also the polarization going on, where people say: Damn it, I want to fight.\u201dSeveral people involved in planning the event said Mr. Upton, 65, had no role in arranging Mr. Biden\u2019s appearance, and Mr. Upton said he was not involved. There is no evidence Mr. Biden was motivated to praise the lawmaker by anything other than sincere admiration, stemming from Mr. Upton\u2019s role in crafting the 21st Century Cures Act after the death of Mr. Biden\u2019s elder son, Beau, from cancer in 2015.Bill Russo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, said the research-funding legislation was the foundation of Mr. Biden\u2019s relationship with Mr. Upton.\u201cIt was one of the few bipartisan bills passed in an otherwise deeply divided and gridlocked Congress,\u201d Mr. Russo said. \u201cVice President Biden believes to his core that you can disagree politically on a lot and still work together in good faith on issues of common cause \u2014 like funding cancer research.\u201dRegarding Mr. Biden\u2019s decision not to endorse Mr. Upton\u2019s Democratic challenger, Matt Longjohn, Mr. Russo said the former vice president \u201creceived hundreds of requests for endorsements from all over the country and endorsed in 135 races this cycle where his impact could be greatest.\u201dImageRepresentative Fred Upton, left, spoke with House Republicans after a meeting at the White House about repealing the Affordable Care Act in May 2017.CreditStephen Crowley/The New York TimesSince leaving office, Mr. Biden has sought out opportunities to earn substantial income \u2014 mainly through paid speeches and a multimillion-dollar book deal \u2014 and his newfound wealth would be closely scrutinized in a presidential race. Mindful of Hillary Clinton\u2019s stumbles in the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Biden has attempted to set guidelines for his activities that would minimize any political sensitivity, declining to give paid speeches to big banks or to accept foreign contributions to several nonprofit organizations he controls.Mr. Biden has continued to pursue commercial activities while he is in the final stage of making a 2020 decision; he is scheduled to give a talk in Grand Prairie, Tex., a suburb of Dallas, on Thursday, as part of an extended tour promoting his 2017 book, \u201cPromise Me, Dad.\u201dThe speaking contract for Mr. Biden\u2019s October appearance in Michigan suggests that the popular Democrat would have known he was addressing a Republican-leaning crowd. The speaking series was underwritten in part by organizations connected to Mr. Upton\u2019s family: Among the biggest sponsors listed on the Economic Club\u2019s website are the Whirlpool Corporation, which was co-founded by Mr. Upton\u2019s grandfather, and the Frederick S. Upton Foundation, a family charity named for the same man.The contract for Mr. Biden\u2019s visit shows he was paid $200,000 for his appearance, including a $150,000 speaking fee and a $50,000 travel allowance. It also specifies that the audience would be \u201cprimarily older, conservative Republicans and local community members.\u201d The document was disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information request made by America Rising, a Republican group that conducts research on Democratic candidates.It is unclear whether the fees Mr. Biden received in this case are standard for all his speeches. Mr. Biden\u2019s aides have declined to confirm what his rates are for paid appearances, including the appearance in Michigan, or how much he has earned through paid speaking since leaving office. In at least one instance, his speaking bureau, Creative Artists Agency, offered a reduced rate of $100,000, plus travel expenses, to the University of Utah.If Mr. Biden were to have charged a similar range of fees for all his comparable speeches since leaving office, he would most likely have collected between $4 million and $5 million through speeches over the last two years.Representatives of Lake Michigan College, which recently took over management of the Economic Club speaker series, and the Fredrick S. Upton Foundation confirmed that the Upton organization was a major sponsor of the series. Both organizations said Mr. Upton had no role in proposing or choosing the speakers. Lisa Cripps-Downey, president of the Berrien Community Foundation, a nonprofit that administers the Frederick S. Upton Foundation, confirmed that the organization had given substantial funding to the Economic Club, with an annual grant of $80,000 over the last three years \u2014 a total close to a quarter-million dollars.\u201cWhen we see the speakers, we\u2019re just as surprised as everybody else,\u201d Ms. Cripps-Downey said.Mr. Russo said Mr. Biden\u2019s team had been aware that the Frederick S. Upton Foundation helped fund the Economic Club. He said Biden aides had vetted the funding sources for the speaking series and concluded they met his standards.Mr. Upton, who confirmed in a statement that he attended Mr. Biden\u2019s speech at Lake Michigan College, said he had \u201cno idea\u201d that Mr. Biden would refer to him at all, let alone so favorably. The two men ran into each other briefly at the venue, before Mr. Biden\u2019s speech, and they agreed to follow up to discuss the medical-research law\u2019s implementation, an aide to Mr. Upton said.\u201cBeing in the audience with my family and hearing Vice President Biden reference our work together was an immense honor,\u201d Mr. Upton said. \u201cHe was warmly received by everyone in attendance who were thrilled to have him there, including myself.\u201dFor campus speeches, Mr. Biden refuses to let schools pay him with funds that come from the government or from extra fees charged to students \u2014 requirements that appear to have been met in this case.Candice Elders, a spokeswoman for Lake Michigan College, said funding for the speaking series there \u201ccomes from private sources through ticket sales, memberships, contributions, grants, sponsorships and event proceeds.\u201d She said the grant from the Frederick S. Upton Foundation is part of a fund designed to make up any difference between expenses for the speaker series and the revenue brought in by events. Ms. Elders estimated that the Upton grant makes up about 11 percent of the series budget.Ms. Elders said that no public money was used for the event, and that Mr. Biden addressed a group that included several hundred college and high school students while he was on campus. \u201cYoung people from area schools and nonprofit organizations are routinely invited to attend Economic Club events at no cost,\u201d Ms. Elders said.The greatest impact of Mr. Biden\u2019s speech, however, was outside the lecture hall. His remarks about Mr. Upton ricocheted through Michigan\u2019s Sixth Congressional District. Mr. Upton alluded to Mr. Biden\u2019s praise in a debate with Mr. Longjohn the next day, and his campaign sent out a mailer stressing Mr. Upton\u2019s bipartisan streak, including Mr. Biden\u2019s description of him as \u201cthe reason we\u2019re going to beat cancer.\u201dA business-backed Republican group, Defending Main Street, ran digital ads on Facebook showing a grinning Mr. Biden and the crucial quote \u2014 \u201cFred Upton is one of the finest guys I\u2019ve ever worked with\u201d \u2014 above a mock version of the former vice president\u2019s signature.Mr. Lester, the local Democratic chairman, said he strove to contain the damage. In an email to Mr. Biden\u2019s staff, Mr. Lester implored the former vice president to back Mr. Longjohn: \u201cSurely VP Biden did not intend to endorse Mr. Upton and slight the local Democratic candidate here,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Longjohn, the former national health officer of the YMCA, said in an interview that he had been disappointed to see Mr. Biden \u201cclap Mr. Upton on the back in an establishment political way.\u201d He said his campaign had reached out to Mr. Biden\u2019s staff through an intermediary, seeking to discuss his involvement in the race.\u201cThere was nothing but silence,\u201d Mr. Longjohn said. \u201cWe had just requested a phone call and there was no response.\u201d"}, {"title": "The Hedge Fund Manager Who Just Paid $238 Million for a Manhattan Penthouse", "category": "Business", "id": "c66b29ff-fee5-40cd-859f-910858fb4243", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/business/who-is-ken-griffin.html", "publishdate": 20190124, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/25/business/25KGRIFFIN/25KGRIFFIN-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Kenneth Griffin, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Citadel, broke a real estate record on Wednesday when he closed on his purchase of a penthouse at 220 Central Park South for $238 million.

Even so, the shares remain much lower than where they were before last November, when a new wave of devastating fires swept through the utility\u2019s vast service territory.PG&E, facing an estimated $30 billion of liability for fires in 2017 and 2018, said last week that it planned to seek bankruptcy protection by the end of the month. California officials say the company\u2019s equipment caused at least 17 of 21 major 2017 wildfires in the state.Investors and government officials have cast doubt on the company\u2019s rationale for a bankruptcy filing. PG&E has enough money on hand to meet day-to-day expenses and its wildfire liability has not been definitively established, these people have said.Financial analysts scrambled on Thursday to figure out the change in PG&E\u2019s liability as a result of the state\u2019s determination about the Tubbs Fire. That overall liability could now be about $8 billion lower, according to one financial research firm, CreditSights.Yet it was not clear whether the news changed the company\u2019s bankruptcy calculations.Gov. Gavin Newsom said that he was surprised by the findings of the state\u2019s fire investigators and that he had spoken to PG&E officials about them. But he said he was not sure whether the news would prompt the company to shift gears.\u201cThis obviously begs the question, now what?\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201cDo we anticipate that PG&E will move forward as they have previewed? That is an open-ended question. That is a question for PG&E.\u201dFor its part, PG&E said it still faced untold financial exposure without making clear whether it would still file for bankruptcy.\u201cThe devastating and unprecedented wildfires of 2017 and 2018 have had a profound impact on our customers, employees and communities,\u201d the utility said. \u201cRegardless of today\u2019s announcement, PG&E still faces extensive litigation, significant potential liabilities and a deteriorating financial situation, which was further impaired by the recent credit agency downgrades to below investment grade.\u201dAt least one of the company\u2019s investors, the New York-based hedge fund BlueMountain Capital, said PG&E ought to reconsider a bankruptcy filing in light of the state\u2019s conclusions about the Tubbs Fire. The hedge fund said earlier on Thursday that it would seek to replace PG&E\u2019s board, which it accused of failing the company\u2019s shareholders, customers and employees.\u201cThe news from CalFire that PG&E did not cause the devastating 2017 Tubbs Fire is yet another example of why the company shouldn\u2019t be rushing to file for bankruptcy, which would be totally unnecessary and bad for all stakeholders,\u201d Omar Vaishnavi, head of fundamental credit at BlueMountain Capital, said in a statement.Investors and analysts who are skeptical that the company needs bankruptcy argue that PG&E has access to plenty of assets it could borrow against or sell to meet its wildfire liabilities, including its headquarters building in San Francisco and its gas business. Selling such assets would still leave the company as the primary electricity utility to much of Northern and Central California.Stocks of companies that are on the verge of filing for bankruptcy often trade for pennies because investors believe that shareholders will get wiped out in a court-ordered reorganization. The Thursday rally in PG&E\u2019s stock could further undermine the case for a bankruptcy. The company\u2019s stock outstanding was worth more than $7 billion at Thursday\u2019s closing price.But PG&E\u2019s board might still decide to seek bankruptcy because it could conclude that is the most expedient way to resolve the thousands of wildfire claims against the utility. A filing could also protect the company in case its liabilities turn out to be much higher than current estimates.California officials have not yet determined the cause of the November 2018 Camp Fire, the state\u2019s most devastating. That wildfire killed at least 86 people and destroyed the town of Paradise. It could be months more before investigators reach a conclusion about its cause. Mr. Newsom said the state expected to determine the cause of the Camp Fire within the first half of the year.Some legal experts said the Tubbs Fire decision probably would not stop the company from filing for bankruptcy.\u201cThis should not change much,\u201d G. Marcus Cole, a law professor at Stanford, wrote in an email. \u201cIf PG&E files for bankruptcy, it is not because of the crushing weight of liability. Instead, it will be for administrative efficiency reasons. They still face hundreds of claims from hundreds of plaintiffs.\u201dInvestors also have to consider the possibility that PG&E still faces large, hard-to-quantify liabilities. Measures to reduce the risks of wildfires, like trimming trees around power lines and installing insulated wiring, could end up costing the company billions.\u201cPG&E\u2019s numerous regulatory, legislative and credit challenges are largely unchanged and we still expect them to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the next few days,\u201d Jeff Cassella, a vice president and senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s, said in a statement.For wildfire victims, PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy plans could cut both ways. Legal experts say newer claims against the utility could be processed more quickly through one bankruptcy court than through several state courts. But claims related to 2017 fires that are further along in the legal process, especially those that are set to go to trial in September, could be delayed by a bankruptcy filing."}, {"title": "China Appears to Block Microsoft\u2019s Bing as Censorship Intensifies", "category": "Business", "id": "7d48768c-515e-4461-88d7-38cbf8d856d5", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/business/china-microsoft-bing.html", "publishdate": 20190124, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/24/business/00bing/00bing-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SHANGHAI \u2014 Under China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, the last vestiges of the global internet have slowly disappeared from an online world that had already shut out Twitter, Google and Facebook.Now one of the last survivors, Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine, appears to have joined them \u2014 even though the American company already censors its results in China.The Chinese government appeared to block the search engine on Wednesday, in what would be a startling renunciation of more than a decade of efforts by Microsoft to engage with Beijing to make its products available. If the block proves to be permanent, it would suggest that Western companies can do little to persuade China to give them access to what has become the world\u2019s largest internet market by users, especially at a time of increased trade and economic tensions with the United States.The Redmond, Wash., company has cooperated with local companies to provide its Windows and cloud services to win acceptance by the Chinese government. Its long-established research and development center has turned out valuable products and launched the careers of a generation of artificial-intelligence experts who have started important new companies in China.Beijing has carried out several waves of increasingly intense crackdowns on internet freedoms as the Communist Party has cemented its control over more aspects of Chinese life. That includes cracking down on foreign internet products, including blocks on Instagram and WhatsApp in recent years.Lately, the Chinese authorities have questioned or detained activists for posting on Twitter, even though the vast majority of people in China can\u2019t access the microblogging service. (The activists generally posted on Twitter via special software that can circumvent China\u2019s censors.)Chinese officials disclose few specifics about their censorship practices, and Bing\u2019s status as of Thursday was not entirely clear. The Cyberspace Administration of China did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In a statement, Microsoft said, \u201cWe\u2019ve confirmed that Bing is currently inaccessible in China and are engaged to determine next steps.\u201dGreatfire.org, a group that tracks what sites are blocked in China, said the site appeared to be inaccessible in parts of the country but reachable in others. China\u2019s blockages often take time to spread nationwide, though in the past some services have been blocked in some places only to be restored later.With Bing, Microsoft tried to play by China\u2019s rules. For example, a search for the Dalai Lama, the religious leader, would turn up state media accounts within China that accused him of stirring up hatred and separatism. Outside the country, it would point to sites like Wikipedia.Other searches, like for Tiananmen Square or the Falun Gong religious group, were similarly scrubbed, though over the years users reported that using coded language could help turn up posts about some topics that were generally controlled.Blocking Bing would brick over one of the last holes in a wall of online filters that has isolated China\u2019s internet from the rest of the world. Although not widely used in China, Bing has remained an option of last resort for some in China looking for an alternative to the dominant local search engine, Baidu. While it continues to dominate search traffic in China, Baidu has been at the center of complaints about poor search results and advertisements for questionable medical treatments.Earlier this week, a former journalist, Fang Kecheng, accused Baidu of largely returning search results that were links to its own products instead of those from external sites. The accusation, which Mr. Fang posted on social media with the headline \u201cBaidu the Search Engine is Dead,\u201d went viral in China.Baidu said in a statement that less than 10 percent of its search results included one specific Baidu product that Mr. Fang had singled out, and that its practices of using its own products in search results helped speed up download times.In an interview, Mr. Fang said the Chinese internet was developing into a series of walled gardens, rather than the sprawling forum for ideas that makes online life appealing to many, thanks to censorship and to the rise of big Chinese internet companies like Tencent and Bytedance that dominate the online experience on mobile phones. Blocking Bing would only make it worse.\u201cBing compromised in order to have a Chinese version to get into the country,\u201d said Mr. Fang, a doctoral candidate at the Annenberg School for Communication at University of Pennsylvania. \u201cIt would be pathetic if even this can\u2019t exist. We have one less alternative.\u201dChina has long been a difficult market for Microsoft. For years, it struggled to contend with widespread piracy of its Windows and Office software.In July 2014, four of its offices in China were stormed by officials who questioned executives, copied contracts and records and downloaded data from the company\u2019s servers. What was described as an antitrust inquiry was spurred by Microsoft\u2019s decision to end support for older Windows software to encourage users to switch to newer versions that were more difficult to pirate, according to analysts. The withdrawal of support for a still widely used, if dated, version of Windows only underscored the country\u2019s reliance on foreign software.In 2017, to ensure state support for Windows, the company partnered with a state-run firm to produce a government-approved version of its Windows 10 software. The firm, Chinese Electronics Technology Corporation, makes electronics for the Chinese military and is a major vendor of surveillance technology in Xinjiang, where the government has thrown hundreds of thousands of Uighurs, a local Muslim minority, into re-education camps.Beijing has insisted on closer scrutiny of software used by government agencies and companies since Edward Snowden, a former American government consultant, revealed that United States intelligence agencies used American technology for hacking purposes.Despite the difficulties, foreign companies still hold out hope for access to China, which with its size and its thriving mobile phone culture represents a potentially vast market. LinkedIn and Airbnb still have businesses there, though they take pains to comply with local laws. LinkedIn, which Microsoft bought in 2016, censors content in China, and Airbnb coordinates with local authorities to provide access about who is staying at its listings.But trade tensions between China and the United States are only adding to the difficulties. Many American companies, along with Trump administration officials, accuse China of systematically forcing American companies to hand over their intellectual property to local partners or to government officials in the name of national security. So far, China has stopped short of boycotting American products, which could escalate the trade conflict and damage the Chinese economy.Baidu\u2019s falling reputation led to some support among China\u2019s intelligentsia for a re-entry by Google into the market with a censored search engine internally code-named Project Dragonfly. Its plans led to widespread criticism from Google\u2019s own employees. Some Chinese activists also protested, arguing a censored search would be tantamount to complicity with Chinese censorship. Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, has said it is \u201cnot close to launching a search product in China.\u201dMr. Fang, the former journalist, said he had mixed feelings about a Google re-entry, noting that it would be good for Chinese who want a better search engine, but also that it would normalize censorship.\u201cI feel people in the West can say from their point of view that they are totally against Google coming back, as they have nothing to do with China,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as someone who truly wishes that Chinese are able to get better-quality information, I can\u2019t 100 percent stand against it.\u201d"}, {"title": "The Hard Part of Computer Science?

At some schools, the shortage is creating an undergraduate divide of computing haves and have-nots \u2014 potentially narrowing a path for some minority and female students to an industry that has struggled with diversity.The number of undergraduates majoring in the subject more than doubled from 2013 to 2017, to over 106,000, while tenure-track faculty ranks rose about 17 percent, according to the Computing Research Association, a nonprofit that gathers data from about 200 universities.Economics and the promise of upward mobility are driving the student stampede. While previous generations of entrepreneurial undergraduates might have aspired to become lawyers or doctors, many students now are leery of investing the time, and incurring six-figure debts, to join those professions.By contrast, learning computing skills can be a fast path to employment, as fields as varied as agriculture, banking and genomics incorporate more sophisticated computing. While the quality of programs across the country varies widely, some computer science majors make six-figure salaries straight out of school.At the University of Texas at Austin, which has a top computer science program, more than 3,300 incoming first-year students last fall sought computer science as their first choice of major, more than double the number who did so in 2014. ImageThe Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Complex and Dell Hall at the University of Texas at Austin, home to one of the nation\u2019s leading computer science programs. A surge in student demand for the courses is outstripping the supply of professors available to teach them.CreditJoanna Kulesza for The New York Times\u201cThe demand is unbounded,\u201d said Don Fussell, chairman of the university\u2019s computer science department. The university is looking to hire several tenure-track faculty members in computing this year, he said, but competition for top candidates is fierce. \u201cI know of major departments that interviewed 40 candidates, and I don\u2019t think they hired anybody.\u201dAlthough the problem has been building for years, a recent boom is straining resources at new levels at institutions large and small. The situation has become so acute that Swarthmore College, which was already holding lotteries to select students for computing classes, is now capping the number of courses that computer science majors may take. The University of Maryland plans this fall to make computing a limited enrollment major, which will make it harder for non-majors to transfer in. At the University of California, San Diego, introductory lecture courses have ballooned to up to 400 students to accommodate both majors and non-majors.As a result of such changes, students on some campuses said they felt shut out of computer science while others said they faced overcrowded classes with overworked professors.Aafia Ahmad, a sophomore computer science major at U.T. Austin, had hoped to take an elective course in computer security this semester. But when she tried to sign up during early registration in November, the course was already full. She said that was the case for nearly every computer science elective she wanted. She is now 79th on a waiting list for the security course.\u201cIt\u2019s a cutthroat race to register for classes,\u201d she said.Some university leaders said they were concerned that certain measures taken to address surging student demand may disadvantage people who are already unrepresented in computer science \u2014 including women, African-Americans, Latinos and low-income, first-generation college students.Some universities now require incoming students to get accepted into computer science majors before they arrive on campus \u2014 and make it nearly impossible for other undergraduates to transfer into the major. That approach can favor incoming students from schools with resources like advanced programming courses. It can also favor male students \u2014 because women on average are less likely to have taken a computer science course in high school.\u201cWhen you put any kind of barrier in place in terms of access to computer science majors, it tends to reduce the number of women and students of color in the program,\u201d said Maria Klawe, president of Harvey Mudd College, a private college in Claremont, Calif., that has become a national model for diversity in computer science.ImageDon Fussell, the chairman of the computer science department at the University of Texas at Austin, said top programs nationwide were competing with tech companies to keep their professors and hire Ph.D.s.CreditJoanna Kulesza for The New York TimesOther experts warned that some students without computing experience may be rushing into the major because it seems to be trendy and pay well \u2014 not because it is the subject that most interests them.\u201cMaybe they are cutting off other options too early,\u201d said Richard Wicentowski, the chairman of Swarthmore\u2019s computer science department.One solution, he suggested: Universities could treat computer science more like math \u2014 courses that lay the foundations for other majors like data science and physics. That way, he said, students could learn important computing skills and then apply them to other majors, like literature, while keeping their job prospects open.On some campuses, students have protested measures like course lotteries and long waiting lists.At Haverford College in Pennsylvania, students put up posters in the science building on April Fools\u2019 Day, lamenting the dearth of computing teachers. One showed a featureless face with the caption: \u201cThis Is Where I\u2019d Put My New Tenure-Track CS Professor \u2026 If I Had One.\u201d Students later wrote a letter to college officials pushing for more professors.Haverford has since opened a search for a new computer science professor.Some schools are trying to create more hospitable conditions. Both Harvey Mudd and the University of Washington in Seattle offer introductory computing courses intended to attract students with or without computing experience.Likewise, Tracy Camp, head of the computer science department at the Colorado School of Mines \u2014 a public university where the number of computer science majors has more than doubled in recent years \u2014 said she was determined not to put in deterrents like capping the major. Instead, she said, class sizes had sharply increased.\u201cI don\u2019t want to tell a student already at Mines, \u2018You can\u2019t major in computer science,\u2019\u201d Professor Camp said.ImageThe computer science complex opened in 2013 at U.T. Austin. The number of incoming students seeking to major in the subject more than doubled between 2014 and 2018.CreditJoanna Kulesza for The New York TimesStill, the pipeline of professors is limited \u2014 partly because of economics and partly because university hiring is geared toward long tenure appointments, not the latest trends.High entry-level salaries are luring undergraduates to pick the private sector over graduate school, limiting the supply of future professors. The number of graduate students enrolled in computer science Ph.D. programs has only inched up in recent years, to nearly 12,700 in 2017 compared with about 11,000 in 2013, according to the Taulbee Survey, an annual report from the Computing Research Association.In addition, tech giants and other companies have been poaching professors and hiring new Ph.D.s.\u201cI had a faculty member who came in with an offer from a bank, and they were told that, with their expertise, the starting salary would be $1 million to $4 million,\u201d said Greg Morrisett, dean of computing and information science at Cornell University. \u201cThere\u2019s no way a university, no matter how well off, could compete with that.\u201dTo stem the tide of professors decamping for industry, universities are turning to dual appointments. Last year Amazon hired Siddhartha Srinivasa, a world-renowned robotics expert who is a computer science professor at the University of Washington. He now splits his time between the two.Ed Lazowska, a computer science professor at the university, said such arrangements gave faculty members access to resources, like giant computing power and tremendous data sets, that could help further their research and benefit their students.\u201cWhat better place could there be than Amazon to put your robot to work?\u201d Professor Lazowska said.Professor Fussell at Texas also said joint appointments could be a partial remedy, adding that he had recently talked with major tech companies about helping universities retain faculty.\u201cThey are well aware that they are eating their seed,\u201d Professor Fussell said.Dr. Klawe at Harvey Mudd is weighing a more academic solution to meeting student demand. She wants to train people with Ph.D.s in subjects like math, physics and biology to teach computer science, potentially increasing the supply of professors.She is raising money for a pilot program, but she said any solution would take time.\u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d Dr. Klawe said."}, {"title": "What\u2019s Next for the Renault-Nissan Alliance?", "category": "Business", "id": "c54317e1-bd26-49ff-9b1e-fc9c92619a17", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/business/renault-nissan-carlos-ghosn-alliance.html", "publishdate": 20190124, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/25/business/25RENAULTEXPLAIN/25RENAULTEXPLAIN-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, on their own, aren\u2019t among the top handful of the world\u2019s auto manufacturers.

He\u2019s no longer in power, and sits in a Tokyo jail cell. Mr. Ghosn personified the alliance, drawing together disparate auto cultures by the force of his personality. Can it survive without him? What has happened since Mr. Ghosn was arrested? A leadership vacuum has opened since Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest. Without their longtime leader, Renault and Nissan have blamed each other for trying to tip the balance of power. The French government, which holds a 15 percent stake in Renault, has weighed in with concerns that Nissan is maneuvering to prevent Renault from participating in the alliance\u2019s decision-making. Mr. Ghosn and Greg Kelly, an aide who was also arrested, occupied seats on the Nissan board. But Nissan had declined a request to hold an immediate shareholder meeting, meaning the French carmaker cannot replace its representatives there. (On Thursday, Nissan said a meeting would be held in April.) The Head of the Alliance Read more about the man who led the partnership.

Nov. 21, 2018How does the auto alliance work? The grouping gives the three companies scale, allowing them to operate as one large group with sales that dwarf those of other carmakers. The alliance sold 10.6 million cars in 2017, compared with the 10.1 million sold by Volkswagen and under nine million vehicles by Toyota. Renault and Nissan teamed up in 1999 to share purchasing and design expertise. They acted as one entity with Mr. Ghosn at the helm, but did not formally merge. Mitsubishi joined in 2016, and the alliance has worked with the German carmaker Daimler on projects like the Mercedes-Benz pickup truck and the production of compact cars. Renault owns a 43 percent stake in Nissan, while Nissan has a 15 percent share in Renault without voting rights. Is it one big happy family?Renault exercised more power than the other carmakers in the alliance, but Nissan sold more cars. The situation stirred resentment on the Nissan side. The Japanese carmaker saw Renault as unfairly piggybacking on Nissan\u2019s technology, research and brand. Renault, for its part, accused Mr. Ghosn of favoring the Japanese and Nissan, and blocking the French manufacturer\u2019s expansion into China, the world\u2019s largest car market, to help Nissan. Mr. Ghosn was trying to push Renault and Nissan to cooperate further, proposing to save $5.7 billion with more coordinated design and manufacturing. His plan involved having all vehicles produced by the automakers be based on four combinations of chassis, engines and transmissions.Do other companies have such alliances? The Nissan-Renault alliance was seen as innovative early on. But now the auto industry is facing technological disruption. Companies are realizing that joining forces with rivals may be the only way to compete and cut costs in developing electric and autonomous cars. Ford and Volkswagen announced an alliance this month to speed the development of electric and self-driving cars. Until recently, Fiat Chrysler (itself the result of a merger of carmakers that dates to 2014) has been upfront about its desire to merge with another big carmaker. It has been working with BMW since 2017 to develop self-driving cars. Daimler and BMW have merged their car-sharing businesses to compete with the efforts of companies like Uber and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. And a number of car companies have working with technology companies, such as Volvo, which provided the chassis for driverless car tests by Uber.

Renault had been waiting for Mr. Ghosn to be released on bail \u2014 but court decisions have kept him jailed in Japan, and the French carmaker has decided to move on.Jean-Dominique Senard, the chief executive of the French tire maker Michelin and a veteran businessman, was named chairman of Renault. Thierry Bollor\u00e9, Renault\u2019s chief operating officer, was named chief executive.Renault said it planned to supervise the \u201cfunctioning of the alliance,\u201d but it is unclear whether anyone can fill Mr. Ghosn\u2019s role as its head. The partnership is considered essential to the success of these automakers. Industry experts believe the carmakers are in desperate need of a strong leader. The companies in the partnership are facing falling demand in the world\u2019s biggest markets \u2014 China, the United States and Europe \u2014 and rising challenges with the emergence of electric cars.

It has also cooperated with the government in developing other parts of its business, such as working with a state-run firm that supplies the military to produce a government-approved version of its Windows 10 software.\u201cThere are times when there are disagreements, there are times when there are difficult negotiations with the Chinese government, and we\u2019re still waiting to find out what this situation is about,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in an interview with Fox Business Network at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.Mr. Smith acknowledged that Microsoft had fewer legal rights in China than in other countries.\u201cThere are certain principles that we think it\u2019s important to stand up for,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019ll go at times into the negotiating room and the negotiations are sometimes pretty darn direct.\u201dThe company is still investigating the shutdown, he said."}, {"title": "\u2018Businesses Will Not Be Able to Hide\u2019: Spy Satellites May Give Edge From Above", "category": "Business", "id": "18302c61-9742-439a-b290-414b29c06e55", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/satellites-artificial-intelligence.html", "publishdate": 20190124, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/25/business/25SATELLITEAI01/merlin_149341389_289f9043-7513-4595-b945-a1f8e628d82f-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In October, the Chinese province of Guangdong \u2014 the manufacturing center on the southern coast that drives 12 percent of the country\u2019s economy \u2014 stopped publishing a monthly report on the health of its local factories.For five consecutive months, this key economic index had shown a drop in factory production as the United States applied billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese exports. Then, amid an increasingly bitter trade war between the United States and China, the government authorities in Beijing shut the index down.A small start-up in San Francisco began rebuilding the index, lifting information from photos and infrared images of Guangdong\u2019s factories captured by satellites orbiting overhead. The company, SpaceKnow, is now selling this information to hedge funds, banks and other market traders looking for an edge.High-altitude surveillance was once the domain of global superpowers. Now, a growing number of start-ups are turning it into a business, aiming to sell insights gleaned from cameras and other sensors installed on small and inexpensive \u201ccube satellites.\u201dThe companies and governments that spent decades using internet services, cameras and other devices to collect data on regular people may soon get a taste of their own information technology.\u201cBusinesses will not be able to hide from competitors or regulators or watchdogs,\u201d said Mark Johnson, chief executive and co-founder of Descartes Labs, another satellite information start-up. \u201cThey need to realize that their traditional competitive advantage \u2014 information \u2014 will be available to everyone.\u201dNearly 730 Earth observation satellites were launched over the last decade, according to Euroconsult, a research firm that tracks the space market. In the next 10 years, 2,220 more will follow them into orbit, training an increasingly wide array of sensors on the planet.Orbital Insight, in Palo Alto, Calif., is one of the first companies to build a business around cube satellite data. Sitting in Orbital\u2019s offices on a recent afternoon, James Crawford, the company\u2019s founder and chief executive, who goes by Jimi, opened his laptop and pulled up a report on three big-name retailers: J. C. Penney, Macy\u2019s and Sears.Based on the company\u2019s satellite data, a color-coded line graph showed a steady drop in the number of cars parked outside the thousands of stores operated by the three retailers. The drop was particularly steep for Sears, which had filed for bankruptcy just days earlier. \u201cThis is one of the reasons they\u2019ve been under so much pressure,\u201d Mr. Crawford said.You don\u2019t need satellite photos to know that Sears is failing. Companies like Orbital Insight are typically tight-lipped when it comes to more important data \u2014 as are their customers \u2014 mainly because they see this information as a competitive advantage.But the line graph showed how Mr. Crawford and his start-up can target the performance of individual businesses. Orbital Insight tracks activity in more than 260,000 retail parking lots across the country, and it monitors the levels of more than 25,000 oil tanks around the world.Not surprisingly, Orbital Insight and SpaceKnow said, some of their customers use this satellite data to track the progress of their direct competitors, though those customers and their competitors are very reluctant to talk about it.Mr. Crawford believes the satellite analysis will ultimately lead to more efficient markets and a better understanding of the global economy. Fred Abrahams, a researcher with the advocacy group Human Rights Watch, sees it as a check on the world\u2019s companies and governments.Mr. Abrahams and his team use satellite imagery to track everything from illegal mining and logging operations to large-scale home demolitions. \u201cThis is why we are so committed to these technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cThey make it that much harder to hide large-scale abuses.\u201dAll of this is being driven by a drop in the cost of building, launching and operating satellites. Today, a $3 million satellite that weighs less than 10 pounds can capture significantly sharper images than a $300 million, 900-pound satellite built in the late 1990s. That allows companies to put up dozens of devices, each of which can focus on a particular area of the globe or on a particular kind of data collection. As a result, more companies are sending more satellites into orbit, and these satellites are generating more data.And recent advances in artificial intelligence allow machines to analyze this data with greater speed and accuracy. \u201cThe future is automation, with humans only looking at the very interesting stuff,\u201d Mr. Crawford said.Orbital Insight does not operate its own satellites. Nor does SpaceKnow or Descartes Labs. The start-ups buy their data from a growing number of satellite operators, and they build the automated systems that analyze the data, pinpointing objects like cars, buildings, mines and oil tankers in high-resolution photos and other images.Now, satellite operators are building similar systems, selling analysis as well as the raw data. The market topped $4.6 billion in 2017. By 2027, it will reach $11.4 billion, according to Euroconsult.What began with satellite cameras is rapidly expanding to infrared sensors that detect heat; \u201chyperspectral\u201d sensors that identify minerals, vegetation and other materials; and radar scanners that can build three-dimensional images of the landscape below. As it reconstructs the Guangdong economic index, SpaceKnow uses infrared imagery, which can help show activity around roughly 600 factories and other industrial sites in the province.After a new satellite went up in December, a Virginia start-up called HawkEye 360 will soon track wireless signals \u2014 a way of understanding the behavior of everything from cellphone networks to cargo ships. This could provide new insight in the progress of cellular companies like AT&T and Verizon, including how many cellular towers are in operation, how active they are, and what technologies and wireless bands are being used.But as technology improves and costs drop, some still warn satellite intelligence gathering has its limits. Finding useful information in satellite imagery can be expensive, said Shawana Johnson, a veteran of satellite intelligence work who is now the president of Global Marketing Insights, a consulting firm dedicated to this area.\u201cYou have to want to look at a variety of activities across the Earth and look at them daily \u2014 or weekly \u2014 for the cost to makes sense,\u201d she said.Others question how useful this data is, particularly for market traders. John Alberg, a data and machine learning specialist who co-founded the investment firm Euclidean Technologies, said traders could find more important and detailed information about companies here on Earth.\u201cSatellite imagery is a narrow niche,\u201d he said.Mr. Johnson, of Descartes Labs, acknowledged that satellite data is not always as useful as it seems to be. Descartes and other companies are still searching for the best ways to use this new trove of information.The data collected by SpaceKnow provides a rough guide to factory production in Guangdong, said Jeremy Fand, the SpaceKnow chief executive. \u201cWe can see when activity is growing \u2014 and slowing,\u201d he said. But it is by no means as detailed or as reliable as the information Guangdong officials were collecting for their original index.In January, one satellite also provided a reminder that this is far more complicated technology than smartphones and street cameras. The WorldView-4 satellite operated by Digital Globe suddenly went dark.\u201cSpace is cool, but it takes a long time to get things right,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just send a technician into space.\u201d"}, {"title": "Are Electric Cars Only for the Rich?

The state, which has been aggressively pushing toward an electric-car future, has made few such inroads in this working-class neighborhood.\u201cElectric vehicles are for the rich. It\u2019s not for us,\u201d said Mike Bokan, who owns an auto-repair shop on Franklin Boulevard, explaining a prevailing attitude. The median income here is $30,000.One solution for making electric vehicles accessible to low-income Californians is coming from an unlikely ally: Volkswagen.In 2016, after admitting to lying about excessive emissions from its diesel vehicles, Volkswagen agreed to pay $14.7 billion in penalties. The settlement also earmarked $2 billion to be invested by Electrify America, a Volkswagen subsidiary, in building a nationwide network of highway chargers that allow long-distance road trips in an electric vehicle. But California, which will receive $800 million from that pool, is requiring 35 percent of the funds to be spent on low-income and disadvantaged communities.Among the first investments are three new all-electric, eight-seat shuttles that will be put into service along Franklin Boulevard \u2014 courtesy of Electrify America. Mr. Bokan, who is also president of the local business association, welcomes the shuttles, due by July. They will be a small relief from the exhaust coming from Highway 99, a diesel-choked trucking route that borders the area.Across town, Sarah Quismondo, a retired nursing staff coordinator, lives in Riverview Plaza, a low-income senior apartment complex. In a neighboring parking lot are two Kia Soul electric cars that are part of a car-share program that began in May 2017. The program provides free access to the cars, and Ms. Quismondo signed up right away.She was so enthused by the experience \u2014 \u201cI love driving these cars, they\u2019re very quiet,\u201d she said \u2014 that she became an official representative of the program, Our Community CarShare. She signed up six other residents, and gives rides to fellow retirees at Riverview Plaza who no longer drive.The program, run by the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District, served as the blueprint for another Electrify America program in the city, just underway, to put 140 all-electric Volkswagen e-Golfs at 70 low-income apartment complexes for car-sharing.The air district\u2019s boss, Alberto Ayala, is a longtime leader in California\u2019s clean-energy efforts. His previous work as the chief enforcer of the state\u2019s vehicle emissions regulations was instrumental in exposing Volkswagen\u2019s diesel deceptions.After the scandal fully came to light, the company agreed to pay huge financial penalties worldwide, two Volkswagen executives were sent to prison \u2014 and Mr. Ayala\u2019s city is now teeming with E.V. experiments.Outside the Edge Water affordable housing complex opposite the county jail, Mr. Ayala points proudly to two more shared electric cars. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want more rebates for Tesla buyers, because they don\u2019t need it.\u201d (The first Tesla cars cost upward of $100,000, and the company is pressing to bring its Model 3 to the mass market.)Mr. Ayala added that programs to democratize electric vehicles were \u201cthe only thing to keep people like me that were involved in the Volkswagen case going.\u201dHe said that for many years, the state\u2019s goal was to lift sales numbers of electric vehicles regardless of how wealthy the buyers might be. \u201cBut the thinking evolved,\u201d he said. \u201cOur political leaders said that\u2019s not going to cut it anymore.\u201dFor nearly a decade, California has offered consumer rebates, as much as $7,000 per car, to make E.V.s more affordable. Since 2011, 15 residents of the 95824 ZIP code that surrounds Franklin Boulevard used the rebates. In the dense 95814 ZIP code where Ms. Quismondo lives, 71 did.ImageThe Whispering Pines apartment complex in Sacramento has Volkswagen e-Golfs for a car-sharing program that began there last fall.CreditBradley Berman for The New York TimesThe combined population of 40,000 in those two ZIP codes received $163,900 in state rebates. By contrast, in the affluent 94025 ZIP code, home to a similarly sized population \u2014 near Tesla\u2019s headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif. \u2014 buyers received $2.4 million in rebates.Persuading people to use the e-Golfs stationed at low-income apartment buildings could be a challenge. They cost 15 cents a minute or $9 an hour to use. Mr. Ayala cited obstacles to adoption in his organization\u2019s car-share program, which is free. He said many residents don\u2019t have driver\u2019s licenses or credit cards, which are needed to activate the service.I paid three visits to the Whispering Pines apartments, which was included in the service by Electrify America on Nov. 1. Each time, I found leaves collecting in the charging ports of the two cars, as if they had not been moved for several days. Envoy Technologies, which operates the program, declined to share usage rates for the cars at Whispering Pines.In yet another Sacramento-based experiment financed by Electrify America, a program called Gig this month started to put the first of 260 all-electric Chevrolet Bolts on city streets in a 13-square-mile zone between downtown and midtown. Seventy percent of residents in this zone are considered low income.Users can locate a Bolt via a mobile app, unlock the door, start it up and drive for $2.50 a mile or $15 an hour. When the ride is completed, members can park the car in any legal spot in the designated zone, lock the door and move on.These activities, which have turned Sacramento into a test bed for equitable access to E.V.s, are being conducted in the first $200 million cycle of the Electrify America investment. The company says these programs have taken about a year to develop and won\u2019t bear fruit until later this year.Even with few of those services fully in operation, Electrify America went back in December to the California Air Resources Board to get approval for the second $200 million cycle. The meeting became contentious when two board members, Assemblyman Eduardo Garcia and the former State Senator Dean Florez, both hailing from rural districts, accused Electrify America of primarily focusing on profits, which it is entitled to earn under the Volkswagen settlement.\u201cThey plan to invest $95 million to $115 million in places like San Francisco, Beverly Hills or La Jolla, where projected demand is high for electric vehicles, rather than building charging stations in lower-income communities where the market will take longer to grow,\u201d they wrote in a Sacramento Bee editorial. \u201cComparatively, only $2 million would be spent for community charging in rural areas badly in need of investment and opportunity.\u201dElectrify America officials say the rural investment in the first two cycles is closer to $50 million, when considering the charging stations positioned at Target and Walmart stores and at other locations along highway routes, as well as urban charging hubs.Encouraging adoption of electric vehicles in rural areas might be the toughest challenge. \u201cElectrify America is not going to want to heavily invest in an area where they think the utilization of the chargers is going to be really low,\u201d said Scott Shepard, a senior research analyst at Navigant Research, which focuses on clean-energy markets. \u201cThey\u2019re going to need extra pushing from regulators.\u201dAfter four hours of testimony from the public and board members, the state approved the second phase of the project. Mr. Florez cast the only vote against moving forward. He cited insufficient investment in rural areas, a lack of data about progress to date and a broken promise to quickly approve a second city to join Sacramento in becoming a test bed.\u201cI have a very serious issue with trust in the company,\u201d Mr. Florez said in an interview. \u201cPeople tend to forget why we got here in the first place,\u201d he added, referring to Volkswagen\u2019s emissions scandal.Giovanni Palazzo, the chief executive of Electrify America, defended the company\u2019s progress and its commitment to equity. He said Electrify America needed to simultaneously serve regions where E.V.s were already popular and \u201cinvest, test and learn where there\u2019s no adoption at all.\u201dElectrify America also faces criticism from competing charging infrastructure companies, like ChargePoint and EVgo. They are unhappy to see a new, well-financed rival \u2014 with the state\u2019s imprimatur and Volkswagen\u2019s funding \u2014 for coveted public charging locations.Mr. Ayala, the former California regulator, is undaunted by the political friction in making electric vehicles accessible to all. \u201cWe know that not all projects are going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this city is now a laboratory where things happen. If we find something that works, we can scale it up to the state level, then the nation and eventually the world.\u201d"}, {"title": "On Politics: Trump Says He\u2019ll Delay State of the Union Until After Shutdown", "category": "Politics", "id": "09bc14d0-ad8c-448f-93d2-3038f794c8f3", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/us/politics/trump-state-of-the-union-shutdown.html", "publishdate": 20190124, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Thursday morning.

Biden Jr. defended his decision to praise an embattled Republican lawmaker during a paid speech in Michigan last fall, telling a group of mayors on Thursday morning that it reflected his philosophy of how to \u201cget things done.\u201dThe New York Times reported on Wednesday that Mr. Biden had earned $200,000 for an October speaking engagement in Benton Harbor, Mich., three weeks before the midterm elections. During that speech, Mr. Biden gave a glowing commendation to Representative Fred Upton, a powerful Republican who joined with Mr. Biden to increase funding for cancer research and, separately, helped forge legislation to gut the Affordable Care Act.In Washington Thursday, Mr. Biden offered a forceful defense of his supportive remarks about Mr. Upton, signaling that he has no intention of blunting his instinct toward bipartisanship and compromise in the event that he runs for president. The former vice president has told allies in recent weeks that he is leaning toward running against President Trump in 2020.\u201cI read in The New York Times today that I \u2014 that one of my problems is if I ever run for president, I like Republicans,\u201d Mr. Biden said, according to a video posted by the public-affairs network C-Span.He joked: \u201cO.K., well, bless me father, for I have sinned.\u201d\u201cFred Upton, I went out and spoke at an event and he was there and I praised him about the fight against cancer,\u201d Mr. Biden continued, citing Mr. Upton\u2019s role in passing the 21st Century Cures Act. \u201cIt mattered, saved people\u2019s lives and he stepped up, he and three other Republicans stepped up and helped us pass it.

Mr. Upton ultimately won re-election by four and a half percentage points, the narrowest margin of his career.The article describing Mr. Biden\u2019s speech to the Economic Club stirred particularly strong criticism of the former vice president among liberal Democrats, who view him as an ideological centrist and distrust his philosophy of aisle-crossing political compromise."}, {"title": "The Week in Tech: Silicon Valley Hobnobs in Davos", "category": "Business", "id": "47a76123-befd-4313-b69a-2186770d5bbc", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/davos-tech-regulation.html", "publishdate": 20190125, "imageurl": "", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Hi, I\u2019m Sheera Frenkel, your friendly cybersecurity reporter.I\u2019m writing from a sunny and glorious San Francisco while the world\u2019s elite share deep thoughts in snowy Davos, Switzerland, at an annual gathering of the rich and powerful.Executives from Facebook, Twitter, Google and Apple wined and dined with the elected officials and regulators who are responsible for holding their companies to account. A lot is at stake. The European Union is looking to enforce its new privacy regulations, and in the United States the Federal Trade Commission is expected to round out its investigation of Facebook within the next month or so.Other countries are also exploring regulation. Our colleagues at Davos reported that on Wednesday leaders of Japan, South Africa, China and Germany issued a call for global oversight of the tech sector.In the next year, important elections will be held in countries including India, Indonesia, Ukraine and Israel. Everyone will be watching to see whether social media is rife with false news and disinformation, and the tech companies will have a chance to show that they\u2019ve changed for the better.If the last week was any indication, things aren\u2019t looking great.Everyone was reminded of the power of social media to divide when a video showing a confrontation in Washington between a group of high school students and a Native American protester went viral.The minute-long video, which was first posted by a Twitter account called @2020fight, initially inspired outrage among liberal groups that believed the students were intimidating and mocking the protester.But within two days, another version of the video, which showed the protester intentionally walking into the group of students, had appeared. Conservative groups took to Twitter to claim that the students, not the protester, were the victims. They called on celebrities and prominent journalists to apologize to the students, and a group of lawyers announced that it would sue popular figures who had tweeted defamatory statements about the incident.Days later, people were still fighting about the video on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and the cable networks. The account that started it all \u2014 along with many that helped amplify it \u2014 remains anonymous.My colleague Kate Conger and I reported Wednesday that lawmakers were asking Twitter for more information about the accounts. There is concern that the accounts that amplified the tweet were foreign (read: Russian) and looking to stir discord among Americans. Twitter said it was investigating. So far, it appears that at least the original poster, @2020fight, is American.The account was suspended by Twitter. But what, at least under Twitter rules, did it do wrong? Many people on Twitter use fake names; many more use fake photos. Neither practice is explicitly against Twitter\u2019s rules, and in many ways the account used Twitter for exactly what the platform was designed to do \u2014 to make something go viral.There\u2019s a question of whether that is good for any of us, or whether, as my colleague Farhad Manjoo succinctly put it in his column this past week, the answer is to \u201cNever Tweet.\u201d\u25a0 Twitter wasn\u2019t the only company to have a bad week. French regulators announced that they had fined Google 50 million euros, or about $57 million, for not properly disclosing how it collected data about its users across its services. Adam Satariano wrote that it was the largest penalty of its kind levied by the European Union, which last year adopted a sweeping new data privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation.\u25a0 In Australia, a sweeping new law gives local law enforcement authorities the power to compel tech companies like Apple to create tools, known as back doors, that would circumvent the encryption they built into their products.My colleague Nellie Bowles reported that the law\u2019s impact could be felt globally. If Apple were to build a back door for iPhones, law enforcement in other countries, including the United States, could ask to use the same tool.The debate about back doors to encryption has been raging for years. Tech companies argue that they encrypt devices to protect users. The police say they need access to devices, especially phones, to do their jobs.\u25a0 In other news about our dystopian future, Cade Metz wrote about start-ups that are turning high-altitude surveillance into a lucrative business. Using cameras, sensors and inexpensive satellites, the companies are selling insights gleaned from those devices to hedge funds, banks and other market traders looking for an edge.\u25a0 Karen Weise wrote about how Amazon is building a huge business out of knowing everything you buy. Amazon doesn\u2019t just know what you buy. It knows how often you buy it, where you ship it to and what you are most likely to buy next.

That will bring together three of the world\u2019s largest messaging networks, which between them have more than 2.6 billion users, allowing people to communicate across the platforms for the first time.The move has the potential to redefine how billions of people use the apps to connect with one another while strengthening Facebook\u2019s grip on users, raising antitrust, privacy and security questions. It also underscores how Mr. Zuckerberg is imposing his authority over units he once vowed to leave alone.The plan \u2014 which is in the early stages, with a goal of completion by the end of this year or early 2020 \u2014 requires thousands of Facebook employees to reconfigure how WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger function at their most basic levels, said the people involved in the effort, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter is confidential.Mr. Zuckerberg has also ordered that the apps all incorporate end-to-end encryption, the people said, a major step that protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in a conversation.In a statement, Facebook said it wanted to \u201cbuild the best messaging experiences we can; and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private.\u201d It added: \u201cWe\u2019re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks.\u201dBy stitching the apps\u2019 infrastructure together, Mr. Zuckerberg hopes to increase Facebook\u2019s utility and keep users highly engaged inside the company\u2019s ecosystem. That could reduce people\u2019s appetite for rival messaging services, like those offered by Apple and Google. If users can interact more frequently with Facebook\u2019s apps, the company might also be able to increase its advertising business or add new revenue-generating services, the people said.The change follows two years of scrutiny of Facebook\u2019s core social network, which has been criticized for allowing election meddling and the spreading of disinformation. Those and other issues have slowed Facebook\u2019s growth and damaged its reputation, raising the hackles of lawmakers and regulators around the world. Mr. Zuckerberg has repeatedly apologized for the problems and has vowed to fix them.Knitting together Facebook\u2019s apps is a stark reversal of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s previous stance toward WhatsApp and Instagram, which were independent companies that Facebook acquired. At the time of the acquisitions, Mr. Zuckerberg promised WhatsApp and Instagram plenty of autonomy from their new parent company. (Facebook Messenger is a homegrown service spun off the main Facebook app in 2014.)WhatsApp and Instagram have grown tremendously since then, prompting Mr. Zuckerberg to change his thinking, one of the people said. He now believes integrating the services more tightly will benefit Facebook\u2019s entire \u201cfamily of apps\u201d in the long term by making them more useful, the person said. Mr. Zuckerberg floated the idea for months and began to promote it to employees more heavily toward the end of 2018, the people said.The effort has caused strife within Facebook. Instagram\u2019s founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger,  left the company abruptly last fall after Mr. Zuckerberg began weighing in more. WhatsApp\u2019s founders, Jan Koum and Brian Acton,  departed for similar reasons. More recently, dozens of WhatsApp employees clashed with Mr. Zuckerberg over the integration plan on internal message boards and during a contentious staff meeting in December, according to four people who attended or were briefed on the event.The integration plan raises privacy questions because of how users\u2019 data may be shared between services. WhatsApp currently requires only a phone number when new users sign up. By contrast, Facebook and Facebook Messenger ask users to provide their true identities. Matching Facebook and Instagram users to their WhatsApp handles could give pause to those who prefer to keep their use of each app separate.ImageMr. Zuckerberg wants to increase the utility of the social network to keep Facebook\u2019s billions of users highly engaged, people involved in the effort said.CreditGerard Julien/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\u201cAs you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work,\u201d Facebook said in a statement.Marc Rotenberg, president and executive director the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said on Friday that the change would be \u201ca terrible outcome for internet users.\u201d He urged the Federal Trade Commission, America\u2019s de facto privacy regulator, to \u201cact now to protect privacy and to preserve competition.\u201dRepresentative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, criticized the change on antitrust grounds.\u201cThis is why there should have been far more scrutiny during Facebook\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which now clearly seem like horizontal mergers that should have triggered antitrust scrutiny,\u201d he said in a message on Twitter. \u201cImagine how different the world would be if Facebook had to compete with Instagram and WhatsApp.\u201dPeople in many countries often rely on only one or two text messaging services. In China, WeChat, which is made by Tencent, is popular, while WhatsApp is heavily used in South America. Americans are more divided in their use of such services, SMS text messages, Apple\u2019s iMessage and various Google chat apps.For Facebook, the move also offers avenues for making money from Instagram and WhatsApp. WhatsApp currently generates little revenue; Instagram produces ad revenue but none from its messaging. Mr. Zuckerberg does not yet have specific plans for how to profit from integrating the services, said two of the people involved in the matter. A more engaged audience could result in new forms of advertising or other services for which Facebook could charge a fee, they said.One potential business opportunity involves Facebook Marketplace, a free Craigslist-like product where people can buy and sell goods. The service is popular in Southeast Asia and other markets outside the United States.When the apps are knitted together, Facebook Marketplace buyers and sellers in Southeast Asia will be able to communicate with one another using WhatsApp, which is popular in the region, rather than using Facebook Messenger or another, non-Facebook text message service. That could eventually yield new ad opportunities or profit-generating services, said one of the people.Some Facebook employees said they were confused about what made combining the messaging services so compelling to Mr. Zuckerberg. Some said it was jarring because of his past promises about independence. When Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, Mr. Koum talked publicly about user privacy, and said, \u201cIf partnering with Facebook meant that we had to change our values, we wouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201dLast month, during one of WhatsApp\u2019s monthly meetings for staff members, it became clear that Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s mandate would be a priority in 2019, said a person who was there. One WhatsApp employee then conducted an analysis of how many potential new users in the United States the integration plan could bring to Facebook, said two people familiar with the study. The total was relatively meager, the analysis showed.To assuage concerns, Mr. Zuckerberg called a follow-up meeting with WhatsApp employees a few days later, three of the people said. On Dec. 7, employees gathered around microphones at the WhatsApp offices to ask him why he was so invested in merging the services. Some said his answers were vague and meandering. Several WhatsApp employees have left or plan to leave because of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s plans, the people said.Unifying the infrastructure for WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger is technically challenging. Unlike Facebook Messenger and Instagram, WhatsApp does not store messages and keeps minimal user data. It is the only one of the services to currently use end-to-end encryption by default.Encrypted messaging has long been supported by privacy advocates who fear governments or hackers may gain access to people\u2019s personal messages. But it will raise other issues for Facebook, particularly related to its ability to spot and curb the spread of illicit activity or disinformation.Last year, researchers had trouble tracking disinformation on WhatsApp before the Brazilian presidential election, before eventually finding ways to do so. WhatsApp has recently placed limits on how many times a message can be forwarded on the service, in an effort to reduce the distribution of false content."}, {"title": "Penguin Random House Closes the Prestigious Imprint Spiegel & Grau", "category": "Business", "id": "8332e62d-06a4-4bac-9471-6bc2bb141eb1", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/books/spiegel-grau-close-penguin-random-house.html", "publishdate": 20190125, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/25/books/25SPIEGELGRAU-COMBO/25SPIEGELGRAU-COMBO-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The publisher Spiegel & Grau, a Penguin Random House imprint known for its best-selling and groundbreaking nonfiction, has been shut down as part of a continuing effort to streamline Penguin Random House\u2019s sprawling operation following the merger between Penguin and Random House in 2013.On Friday, the company announced that the imprint will be shuttered and that its founders, Cindy Spiegel and Julie Grau, will leave. The news came as a shock to some at the company and in the publishing world, as the imprint had just completed one of its most successful years. In 2018, it published multiple New York Times best sellers and other high-profile titles, including a book about the Beastie Boys by the band members Michael Diamond and Adam Horovitz, and one about pressing societal concerns by the Israeli historian and philosopher Yuval Harari.The imprint, which was started at Doubleday in 2007 and moved to Random House in 2008, has over the years amassed a stable of prominent authors and award-winning books.Spiegel & Grau published \u201cBetween the World and Me,\u201d by Ta-Nehisi Coates, a best seller that won a 2015 National Book Award and helped drive conversation about police violence and systemic racism. They also published best sellers like Bryan Stevenson\u2019s \u201cJust Mercy,\u201d the memoir \u201cBorn a Crime,\u201d by the \u201cDaily Show\u201d host Trevor Noah, Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cDECODED,\u201d Piper Kerman\u2019s prison memoir \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d and books by popular self-help authors like Suze Orman and Bren\u00e9 Brown.Some authors who started their careers at Spiegel & Grau mourned the end of the imprint. Ms. Kerman, whose memoir was adapted into a successful Netflix series, credited Ms. Grau with taking a chance on her when she was an aspiring writer who had never published anything and was still on federal probation.\u201cShe understood the book I aspired to write and helped me do it with kindness and ferocious intelligence,\u201d Ms. Kerman said in an email. \u201cShe has a brilliant sense of story and knows where an author fits into a cultural moment.\u201dMs. Spiegel and Ms. Grau developed a track record for publishing prescient works that tapped into the cultural zeitgeist. At a moment when editors and publishers were looking for books by authors from diverse backgrounds, the imprint became something of a magnet for books by African-American writers and cultural figures.ImageJulie Grau (left) and Cindy Spiegel developed a track record for publishing prescient works that tapped into the cultural zeitgeist.One of Spiegel & Grau\u2019s top editors, Chris Jackson, left in 2016 to revive another Random House  imprint, One World.Despite its successes, Spiegel & Grau became yet another casualty of corporate restructuring. Its closing follows the merger last fall of two of the company\u2019s most successful publishing lines, Crown and Random House. The new joint division is being led by Gina Centrello, formerly the president and publisher of Random House. In a memo to employees at that time, Madeline McIntosh, the chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S., said that Crown and Random House \u201cwill retain their distinct editorial identities.\u201dMs. Spiegel and Ms. Grau are the latest prominent editors and publishers to depart as a result of the shake-up. In the aftermath of the reorganization, Maya Mavjee, Crown\u2019s president and publisher, left the company and will be moving to Macmillan; Crown\u2019s senior vice president and publisher, Molly Stern, who edited Michelle Obama\u2019s book, left the company. Emi Ikkanda, an editor at Spiegel & Grau, will also leave with the shuttering of the imprint.The consolidation comes at a moment when big publishing houses are trying to adapt to the shift toward online retail. Some of the biggest publishing houses have been adding imprints and acquiring smaller publishing companies to stay competitive, hoping that getting bigger would give them an advantage when negotiating terms with retailers and distributors. In 2016, Hachette Book Group struck a deal to acquire Perseus, an independent publishing house, and in 2014 News Corporation bought the romance publisher Harlequin for $415 million.When Penguin and Random House merged in 2013, they became by far the largest of the \u201cbig five\u201d publishing houses, which also include Hachette, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Macmillan.Lately, however, there have been signs that the biggest publishing houses feel the need to contract and consolidate by eliminating and combining imprints. Last year, Hachette shifted its free-standing Hachette Books nonfiction line to the Perseus Books division. In 2017, Penguin shut down Blue Rider Press.Penguin Random House, which houses around 275 imprints worldwide and generates some $4 billion annually, has begun to look for ways to streamline its publishing lines, a move that could help to curb duplication across imprints.In a company memo, the Random House publisher Susan Kamil said Spiegel & Grau\u2019s authors would move to other imprints.\u201cWhile the S & G list will no longer exist as a stand-alone imprint, its amazing authors will be fully and proudly supported by Random House, The Dial Press and One World,\u201d Ms. Kamil wrote."}, {"title": "Vodafone, One of World\u2019s Largest Cell Carriers, Halts Buying of Huawei Gear", "category": "Business", "id": "98752f97-05c0-4014-917e-cf274afe4745", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/vodafone-huawei.html", "publishdate": 20190125, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/26/business/26hauwei/merlin_149727216_13a44fe0-e9ec-46a1-87e1-793d7204fabd-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LONDON \u2014 The Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei was dealt another blow on Friday when one of the world\u2019s largest wireless carriers suspended its purchases from the company in Europe over security concerns about its ties to the Chinese government.Vodafone Group, which is based in London, said it would temporarily stop buying Huawei equipment for core parts of its next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G. Nick Read, Vodafone\u2019s chief executive officer, said the pause was necessary while European governments considered whether to ban the use of Huawei equipment.Mr. Read said Vodafone\u2019s decision reflected political factors rather than any newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Huawei has been dogged by a campaign led by United States officials, who have argued that Beijing could use the company\u2019s gear for spying.\u201cThe noise level is at an unhealthy level across Europe,\u201d Mr. Read said during a conference call with reporters.Europe has become a key battleground for Huawei, the world\u2019s largest supplier of telecommunications equipment. The region is the company\u2019s second-largest market after China, largely because of lucrative partnerships with carriers that, in addition to Vodafone, include BT Group, Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica. In contrast to its strained relationship with the United States, Huawei has also enjoyed strong ties to European governments, thanks in part to investments it has made throughout the region.The United States has pressured its European allies to increase their scrutiny of Huawei. The American authorities have cited moves by President Xi Jinping of China to take more control of the country\u2019s economy and the enactment of laws that could require network operators to defend Chinese national security interests.Last month, Canada detained a Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, a daughter of the company\u2019s founder, at the request of the United States on charges that she participated in a scheme to violate sanctions against Iran. Federal prosecutors in Seattle are also investigating Huawei over allegations of intellectual property theft.Suspicions about Huawei have led countries like Britain, France and Germany to re-evaluate their relationships with the company.  A Huawei employee was arrested and charged with espionage in Poland this month. (The company fired the employee shortly after he was arrested.)Vodafone\u2019s announcement followed one last month by BT to remove Huawei gear from parts of its network. Deutsche Telekom has also said it is re-evaluating its relationship with suppliers to account for the growing security concerns.Getting boxed out of the 5G market in Europe would be painful for Huawei. Wireless companies in the region plan to spend billions of dollars to upgrade their networks to 5G, a potential windfall for suppliers of equipment for the underlying infrastructure.Huawei said Vodafone\u2019s move affected only a small amount of equipment.\u201cVodafone and Huawei are long-term strategic partners that have worked together since 2007,\u201d Huawei said in a statement. \u201cWe are grateful to Vodafone for its support of Huawei, and we will endeavor to live up to the trust placed in us.\u201dVodafone said its decision would be limited to equipment at the core of its network that handles much of the sensitive data related to calls and internet traffic. The company will continue to rely on Huawei for ancillary gear like cellular antennas.Mr. Read called Huawei a \u201cstrong partner\u201d and expressed frustration about the debate over the possible security threat it posed. \u201cI don\u2019t think everyone is being clear enough and being fact based,\u201d he said. He added that Vodafone would continue to use Huawei as it hadin other markets, including Africa.He also warned that if regulators imposed a broad ban on Huawei that affected antennas and other equipment, it would delay the introduction of the faster networks in Europe. Such a move, he said, \u201cwould have significant financial costs, have significant customer disruption and would ultimately be delaying the 5G launch in many countries.\u201d"}, {"title": "Tax Filing Season Is Starting, but It May Not Go Smoothly", "category": "Business", "id": "3ebd6084-e687-4aa4-b656-6136ee937531", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/your-money/tax-returns-refund-irs-shutdown.html", "publishdate": 20190125, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/26/business/26Adviser-sub-illo/merlin_149741301_1df0e8e1-bdaf-49ce-b51e-9751c5bb560e-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Tax preparers, bracing for a tricky filing season, are advising taxpayers to file returns as they usually do, but to be prepared for possible delays if they are due refunds.The Internal Revenue Service is scheduled to begin processing 2018 federal tax returns on Monday, but is facing two major challenges that threaten to make this tax time chaotic. Even with the government reopening, it will take a while for the I.R.S. to return to normal. The shutdown started as I.R.S. employees were in the midst of being trained about the sweeping changes that Congress made to the tax code in 2017, the head of the union representing the agency\u2019s workers said. So I.R.S. employees may not initially be fully up to speed and able to answer questions and tackle the inevitable snafus.Nearly three-fourths of all returns result in refunds, and the average refund last year was nearly $3,000, the I.R.S. reports. Many families rely on their refunds to make purchases or pay bills.The I.R.S. has said it expects refunds to be issued on schedule. Typically, that means nine of 10 refunds are issued within 21 days, if the return was filed electronically and the refund is sent using direct deposit.\u201cThe I.R.S. expects business as usual with refunds,\u201d said Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant with the popular tax preparation software TurboTax.Cindy Hockenberry, director of tax research and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals, said it remained to be seen how quickly the I.R.S. could get operations running, since the end of the impasse came just days before the opening of tax filing season.\u201cI still think it will take a bit of time to get everything rolling 100 percent at the I.R.S.,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cif there is another shutdown in three weeks, we\u2019ll be back to square one.\u201dMuch of the federal government has been shut down for more than a month as a result of the political stalemate between President Trump and Democrats in Congress over funding for a border wall.Tony Reardon, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said on Thursday that the I.R.S. staff and agency funding had already been diminished before the shutdown and that it would probably take time for the agency to get back up to speed when it does reopened.While the government is reopening for at least three weeks, it\u2019s unclear whether all I.R.S. employees will return to work immediately, Mr. Reardon said on Friday evening. \u201cThe agency is hopeful of getting normal operations going on Monday,\u201d he said, since tax filing season is officially starting. But workers, he said, were awaiting specific instructions from their supervisors. The union is urging the government to be flexible and pay workers as quickly as possible, he said, since many are facing financial hardship from missing two paychecks during the shutdown.As to the I.R.S. help line, taxpayers and tax preparers will probably have longer waiting times this year.\u201cEven in a good season, there\u2019s a backup,\u201d said Edward Karl, vice president for taxation with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.Despite the uncertain environment, Mr. Karl said, taxpayers who typically file early should do so, as soon as they have the necessary documents, like W-2 income statements.\u201cThe critical thing for taxpayers is to presume it\u2019s business as usual,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, the I.R.S. has announced a bit of relief for some taxpayers: If you underpaid your taxes in 2018, you\u2019re less likely to pay a penalty this year. The agency said this month that because of tax changes passed by Congress in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it would waive the penalty for many filers who underpaid.The change \u2014 just for the 2018 tax year \u2014 is aimed at helping taxpayers who were \u201cunable to properly adjust\u201d their withholding and estimated tax payments because of the \u201carray of changes\u201d under the tax law, and may have inadvertently underpaid, the I.R.S. said.The federal tax system is \u201cpay as you go,\u201d so taxes must be paid periodically, rather than all at once. Typically, taxpayers pay a penalty if their payments, from paycheck withholding or extra estimated tax payments, total less than 90 percent of the amount owed. (Other criteria also apply. For instance, if you underpaid but owe less than $1,000, you\u2019re not subject to any penalty.) For 2018 returns, the I.R.S. said, the threshold will be lowered to 85 percent.Here are some questions and answers about this year\u2019s tax filing season:When is the deadline?For most taxpayers, the federal filing deadline is April 15. But because of the timing of local holidays on April 15 in Maine and Massachusetts \u2014 and another on April 16 in Washington, D.C. \u2014 taxpayers who live in Maine or Massachusetts have until April 17 to file.Do I have to wait until Monday to file my taxes?No. Consumers using professional preparers, or do-it-yourself tax software, can prepare their returns ahead of time, and have them filed electronically when the I.R.S. starts accepting them on Monday. The I.R.S. encourages electronic filing \u201cfor faster refunds.\u201dI completed my return using TurboTax but got a notice to redo it. What should I do?Some TurboTax users were notified ahead of the filing season that they should redo their returns because of a software glitch. The potential problem occurred when TurboTax, which millions of people use to file their returns, transferred the prior year\u2019s data into the current year\u2019s return. \u201cIn some cases,\u201d the notice to users said, \u201ca few pieces of information may be inaccurate or left out.\u201dTurboTax advised users to clear their current return and start over. Intuit, the program\u2019s parent, offered free tax filing for those affected.TurboTax said the glitch had affected a \u201csmall\u201d number of filers but declined to be specific."}, {"title": "Did Trump Cave on the Wall?

The layoffs, which the staff learned about from an email sent by the BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti, are expected to continue into next week and affect around 200 employees.The staff reduction at BuzzFeed News included the seven members of the national desk, the six-person national security team and the two journalists covering health, according to the spokesman.

There were no cuts to the technology, politics or investigations teams.\u201cThe national desk at @BuzzFeedNews was killed off today,\u201d Tina Susman, the national editor, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis was my first full-time editing gig, and I nearly didn\u2019t take the job, but despite tday\u2019s gloominess i\u2019m glad I did. It\u2019s been great, and I\u2019m proud to ride out the front door with my team.\u201dJessica Testa, a national reporter who was laid off after about seven years at BuzzFeed News, said she felt blindsided. \u201cOur work has always, always been celebrated, internally and by readers,\u201d Ms. Testa said in an email interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed laws, we\u2019ve won awards, we have great traffic.\u201dThe cuts are meant to lower costs and maintain growth as the company aims to hit profitability this year. BuzzFeed, which employs more than 1,300 people, generated more than $300 million in revenue in 2018, a 15 percent increase from the previous year.In 2017, the company fell short of its revenue goal of $350 million, with sales coming in at $260 million, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the company\u2019s finances. One hundred people were laid off, and considerations for a public offering were shelved.In a November interview with The New York Times, Mr. Peretti proffered an audacious solution to deal with the volatile landscape for online content: a series of mergers with five or six top internet publishers, including Vice, Vox Media, Group Nine Media and Refinery 29.[Read our interview with Mr. Peretti about his plan to make BuzzFeed profitable.]BuzzFeed had spoken to at least one of these companies, people familiar with the matter said at the time. The staff cuts will help accelerate any plans to merge with another business.In particular, BuzzFeed has deep ties to Group Nine Media, the digital media company behind Thrillist, Seeker, The Dodo and NowThis. Its chief executive, Benjamin Lerer, has long been friends with Mr. Peretti, and his father, the venture capitalist Kenneth Lerer, is the chairman of BuzzFeed. (The younger Mr. Lerer has stressed that any business deal between the two would not include his father, to avoid conflicts of interest.)On Thursday, BuzzFeed News employees in New York were told to be in the office on East 18th Street no later than 10 a.m. the next day. Some reporters not in New York learned their fates over the phone. Many of those who were dismissed announced their departures on social media.\u201cI\u2019ve been on vacation for two weeks, and received the news over the phone an hr ago while I stood on a street in Delhi,\u201d Talal Ansari, a reporter, wrote on Twitter. \u201cNow, I write this as I wait to go through airport security. Being laid off from 8k mi away doesn\u2019t make this any easier.\u201dMarisa Carroll, the deputy national editor, who edited a notable series of articles on accusations of sexual misconduct against the R&B artist R. Kelly, was also laid off. So were John Stanton, who led the Washington bureau for many years before moving to New Orleans to be a national reporter; Cates Holderness, who ignited an internet phenomenon in 2015 with a post that triggered a debate about whether a dress was blue and black or gold and white; and Tyler Kingkade, a national reporter who covered sexual assault and Title IX issues.\u201cIt\u2019s a rough business,\u201d Mr. Kingkade wrote on Twitter.Some employees took advantage of an internal Slack messaging channel called AJA, for \u201cAsk Jonah Anything,\u201d to make their displeasure known. In messages reviewed by The Times, one staff member asked if employees could bring dogs to work on Monday, to alleviate stress. After Mr. Peretti chimed in, saying it was a \u201cgood idea,\u201d another staff member wrote, \u201cDogs won\u2019t save us from this hell.\u201dThe international bureaus will also be affected by the cutback. The Spain office has been shut down. Last week, Janine Gibson, a longtime editor at The Guardian who was the editor in chief of BuzzFeed UK, left the publication.In the days leading up to the layoffs, BuzzFeed News came under scrutiny after publishing an article reporting that President Trump had instructed his former lawyer Michael D. Cohen to lie in his testimony to Congress. In a rare public statement, the special counsel\u2019s office denied the report. Mr. Smith has said he stands by the article.The layoffs at BuzzFeed capped off a gutting week for news operations. On Thursday, HuffPost\u2019s parent company, Verizon Media Group, announced a 7 percent cut in its media divisions, which equals about 800 positions. Gannett cut jobs at papers across the country, including The Indianapolis Star, The Tennessean in Nashville and The Record in North Jersey.By midafternoon on Friday, Mr. Smith had told the staff in an email that managers had spoken with all employees in the United States news division whom the company had decided to let go.\u201cWe can talk Tuesday about what\u2019s next, and how to emerge from this a strong, focused newsroom,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll continue to do distinctive work on the biggest stories, and punch above our weight.\u201dHe added, \u201cI know it\u2019s been a hard day.\u201d"}, {"title": "Businesses Are Taking Action After Brexit Warnings Go Unheeded", "category": "Business", "id": "9ff66a0b-2ac6-47df-9fc7-dbe87f1f4e6d", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/business/brexit-no-deal-airbus-uk.html", "publishdate": 20190125, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/26/business/26bizbrexit-print/26bizbrexit-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Businesses have been sounding the alarm over Britain\u2019s impending departure from the European Union ever since its approval in a 2016 referendum. But this week, with lawmakers unable to agree on any sort of orderly plan as the March deadline for a deal nears, their warnings rang louder \u2014 and some decided to act.Airbus and Bentley called the prospect of Brexit without an agreement a \u201ckiller\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d Sony, concerned about Brexit-generated disruptions, said it would move its European headquarters from Surrey to the Netherlands. Other companies are furiously stockpiling supplies, while civil servants are scrambling to prepare for emergency arrangements. While politicians may yet pull together a deal before March 29, analysts say businesses have run out of time. The precarious state of affairs is already damaging the economy. \u201cUntil the middle of last year, it was a slow burn \u2014 we lost about 2 to 3 percent of output,\u201d said Amit Kara, head of British macroeconomic research at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. \u201cMy feeling is it has gathered a little bit of pace since then.\u201d Manufacturers are increasingly reluctant to invest in uncertain political and economic conditions, according to a survey published this week by the Confederation of British Industry, and some business leaders are going public with their frustration. \u201cThey\u2019re breaking cover because they\u2019re feeling close to the edge at this point,\u201d said Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics and public policy at King\u2019s College London. Airbus, which employs about 14,000 people in Britain making wings for its aircraft, said that if the country left the European Union with no deal, supply-chain disruptions would force it to look to move its factories elsewhere.\u201cMake no mistake: There are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft,\u201d Tom Enders, the chief executive, said in a video posted on YouTube this week. The British transportation industry imports a large portion of its parts from the European Union and sells a large portion of its products there. Airbus warned last summer that a Brexit without a replacement deal could cost it more than $1 billion a week. In his video, Mr. Enders called it a \u201cdisgrace\u201d that businesses still did not have enough information to make plans. \u201cPlease don\u2019t listen to the Brexiteers\u2019 madness which asserts that, because we have huge plants here, we will not move and we will always be here,\u201d he said, referring to supporters of Brexit. \u201cThey are wrong.\u201d Since Parliament defeated Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan last week, lawmakers have been battling over a second, similar plan she presented. Mrs. May has refused to rule out leaving the European Union without an agreement, gambling that lawmakers will back her rather than allow that possibility.\u201cThe U.K. is not and cannot be ready for a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit,\u201d Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said Tuesday. \u201cOnly Parliament can avoid it, and now is the time to do so.\u201d The chief executive of the Civil Service, John Manzoni, conceded that his organization would not be fully prepared. \u201cWill things be a bit bumpy? Of course, they will,\u201d Mr. Manzoni said Tuesday at the Institute for Government, a British policy group. The chief executive of Bentley, Adrian Hallmark, told Reuters on Tuesday that his luxury car company had been headed for a turnaround after a year of losses, but that political events could scupper its plans. \u201cIt\u2019s Brexit that\u2019s the killer,\u201d he said. Another carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, confirmed on Thursday that it would pause production for a week in April to deal with potential disruptions. Companies are planning stockpiles of parts and supplies \u2014 if they can find room. The United Kingdom Warehousing Association surveyed its members last month and said three-quarters were already full and unable to take on more business. Many businesses also do not have the money to stockpile and prepare, said Mr. Kara of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. \u201cIf we did have a hard Brexit, the shock would be quite significant,\u201d he added. UK in a Changing Europe, a research group, has estimated that leaving without a deal could reduce Britain\u2019s gross domestic product per capita by as much as 8.7 percent over 10 years from what it would be if the nation remained in the bloc. \u201cWhat you see here is a bit of frustration that the U.K. government could have handled it so badly and ignored the concerns of business,\u201d said Mr. Portes of King\u2019s College London, who is also a senior fellow at UK in a Changing Europe. Even if an agreement is reached in time, the turmoil of the debate will have a lasting impact, he said.Airbus has made it clear that \u201cwhen it comes to the next big investment decision, the U.K. is not going to be on the list,\u201d Mr. Portes said. \u201cIn the medium to long term, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019ll have a large negative effect on any future investment.\u201d Foreign direct investment in Britain is already 19 percent lower than it would have been had the referendum not happened, according to researchers at the University of Sussex. Dyson, the home appliances company, denied on Tuesday that its decision to  relocate move its headquarters from England to Singapore was related to Brexit, but few saw it as a vote of confidence for the business environment in Britain. And Brexit might not be the only challenge for the British economy, Mr. Kara said. The global economy is slowing, and Britain is likely to be vulnerable should there be another shock to it, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s like a country that has an armed force that is able to battle on one front, but if another front opens up, we are certainly more vulnerable than many other countries,\u201d he said.

Want this by email? Sign up here.Shutdown, Day 35: A \u201c \u2018let them eat cake\u2019 kind of attitude\u201dIt went viral. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, told Andrew on CNBC that he didn\u2019t quite understand why unpaid workers, some of them now turning to Uber and Lyft for income after missing their second paycheck, were visiting food banks. They should just borrow some money, he said:There really is not a good excuse why there should be a liquidity crisis. Now, true, the people might have to pay a little bit of interest. But the idea that it\u2019s paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea.The comments reflect a \u201c \u2018let them eat cake\u2019 kind of attitude,\u201d said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has emerged as a powerful opponent to President Trump.Federal workers, many of them wary of taking on more debt, might also struggle to access credit. The credit union affiliated with Mr. Ross\u2019s department advertises a shutdown loan with a rate higher than some other commercially available loans.As the shutdown drags on, lawmakers are scrambling to find a compromise after two proposals to reopen the government fell flat in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Trump\u2019s plan, which included funding for a border wall, garnered less support than the Democrats\u2019 recommendation, which omitted the wall.The strain intensifies: \u2022 Low- and middle-income home buyers in rural areas are left in the lurch without an affordable mortgage option offered by the Agriculture Department.\u2022 Tyson Foods donated 685,000 meals to federal workers.\u2022 The shutdown threatens to taint the appeal of public service, which \u201cwill make it harder to recruit and hold onto the experienced and talented,\u201d Campbell Robertson writes.\u2022 Patent handling may have to cease in mid-February.\u2022 James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, said a prolonged shutdown would \u201chave an extremely damaging effect.\u201d Economists from J.P. Morgan said that, already, the stalemate had taken a toll on the U.S. economy.____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Davos, Switzerland; Stephen Grocer in New York; and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________A grim outlook in Davos, and in the rest of the worldThe mood at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort is \u201csubdued, cautious and apprehensive,\u201d a reflection of the broader outlook, Fareed Zakaria writes in the Washington Post:There is no great global political crisis, yet people speak in worried tones about the state of democracy, open societies and the international order.The reason: Mr. Zakaria points to a noticeable absence of leadership from defenders of democracy. President Trump scrapped plans to attend to focus on domestic problems, as did Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France.The worry: The leaders of smaller countries described the world as lacking a collective purpose, he writes. Many yearn for a greater U.S. presence on the global stage, but with nobody shoring up the international system, will it weaken and eventually crumble?The warnings: Michael Sabia, who runs the $270 billion Canadian pension fund Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec, complained that capitalists had forgotten their purpose as backers of corporate investment. \u201cToo many equity investors are tourists; they\u2019re not interested in building a business,\u201d he said. And in a provocative speech, the billionaire philanthropist George Soros criticized President Xi Jinping, saying that China\u2019s technological advancements made Mr. Xi a \u201cdangerous opponent of open societies.\u201dGrowth suffers as globalization falls to a snail\u2019s paceComplacency toward the trade tensions between the U.S. and China are misplaced, according to the Economist, because the rift is compounding a gradual shift in the world economy. Globalization, so the argument goes, has given way to a new era of sluggishness, or \u201cslowbalization.\u201dThe back story: In the golden age of globalization, from about 1990 to 2010, commerce soared as the cost of transporting goods fell, tariffs were cut and the financial system became liberalized.The shift: Trade is suffering, and companies are changing their long-term investment plans. \u201cSlowbalization\u201d is expected to lead to stronger ties to regional blocs as supply chains seek sources closer to home.Why it matters: Emerging countries will struggle to trade their way to riches. Climate change, migration and tax-dodging will be even harder to solve without global cooperation.The effect is being felt around the world:\u2022 Germany\u2019s industrial slump worsened at the start of 2019, casting a cloud over the eurozone economy.\u2022 Norway\u2019s central bank said it was prepared to raise interest rates as soon as March, but warned of \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d as it moves to wind down its stimulus plan.\u2022 Starbucks put its recent sales slump behind it, beating analyst estimates in crucial regions, but the company\u2019s growth in China is at a crawl.PG&E, absolved in Tubbs Fire, is challenged over bankruptcy plansThe utility was cleared of responsibility in the 2017 blaze that chewed through a wide swath of Northern California, leading some to question whether the company should move ahead with its plans to file for bankruptcy by the end of the month.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said that private electrical equipment in a home caused the Tubbs Fire in Sonoma County, which killed 22 people and destroyed more than 5,600 buildings. PG&E\u2019s stock, which has plunged dramatically in recent months, surged 75 percent after the news on Thursday.But the company is still facing billions of dollars of potential liabilities. State officials blame PG&E equipment for at least 17 of 21 major wildfires in 2017.Bankruptcy, however, may not be the best course of action, according to many investors and analysts who say that PG&E has plenty of assets it could leverage against claims.ImageA wildfire in Utah last year, seen with the help of infrared imaging.CreditDescartes Labs, via Associated PressI spy with my satellite eyeFrom high above the Earth, a brigade of satellites can track the number of cars parked outside Sears stores, identify illegal logging operations, sense activity from cellular towers and snap infrared images of factories in Guangdong, China.Nowadays, it\u2019s not only superpower governments that can gain access to the trove of information.

Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Trump campaign officials in June 2016, with obstruction of justice in another case raises an interesting question: Why would the Justice Department pursue a case in which there is little likelihood of ever getting the defendant to the United States?The charges stem from a civil asset forfeiture case filed two years ago. Ms. Veselnitskaya is accused of making false statements in that case to thwart a money laundering investigation involving her clients, Prevezon Holdings and its owner, Denis P. Katsyv, an influential Russian businessman. According to the Justice Department, the defendants financed real estate purchases in New York to hide funds as part of a tax evasion scheme.In an interview with Yahoo News, Ms. Veselnitskaya said that she would not return to the United States but planned to use \u201call methods\u201d to defend herself.That may sound like a protestation of innocence, but by refusing to come to the United States, she can avoid having to defend herself in court because there is little prospect the Russian government would extradite her.The Justice Department\u2019s decision to indict Ms. Veselnitskaya may be an effort to send a message that the civil asset forfeiture case was tainted by her actions. The United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan has been smarting ever since it hastily settled the case in 2017 for $6 million.Prevezon essentially thumbed its nose at the Justice Department. The firm issued a statement at the time, saying that it \u201cagreed to settle the lawsuit without admitting any guilt for less than three percent of the amount initially sought by the U.S. Government to avoid the exorbitant costs of additional litigation.\u201dThis month prosecutors charged Ms. Veselnitskaya with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503(a), which makes it a crime to endeavor \u201cto influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.\u201dDuring the Prevezon investigation, United States prosecutors had asked the Russian government for help under a mutual legal assistance treaty. The Russian government refused and instead produced a document that purported to exonerate Russian officials and Prevezon, according to the indictment.In a submission to the federal court, Ms. Veselnitskaya stated that information in the document came only from the Russian government.But according to the indictment, Ms. Veselnitskaya secretly worked with a senior Russian prosecutor to draft the document, receiving multiple drafts and helping to write it herself.The document was part of an effort to resist the Justice Department\u2019s request to have the judge enter what is called a summary judgment, which would have established that the money was the proceeds of criminal conduct. The court denied the request of prosecutors, helping her clients prolong the case.Even though the indictment is unlikely to be tried, the obstruction charge is an interesting piece of a much larger puzzle as part of the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.Charging her with obstruction of justice could be a step toward raising additional questions about the meeting she had in June 2016 at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman at the time, and serve to undermine her statements about the meeting. By charging her, she would effectively be unavailable as a witness if prosecutors want to pursue other participants in the meeting.But it also raises questions about whether more will come out about her role in the 2016 election, and whether she provided other assistance on behalf of the Russian government. The obstruction of justice indictment may be just the first step in a much broader effort to show the role Russia played in the election and its possible collusion with the Trump campaign."}, {"title": "A Bruised Trump Faces Uncertain 2020 Prospects.

Mr. Trump, close associates acknowledge, appears without a plan for mounting a strong campaign in 2020, or for persuading the majority of Americans who view him negatively to give him another chance.Compounding the harm to Mr. Trump on Friday was the indictment of Roger Stone, his political adviser for several decades, on charges of lying to investigators and obstructing the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The indictment was taken by some Republicans as the surest sign yet that Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation is likely to grow more painful to Mr. Trump and his associates before it wraps up.Mr. Trump still commands the loyalty of a passionate electoral base that has rallied to him in trying moments, and advisers believe he will have room to right himself while Democratic presidential candidates are mired in a long nomination fight. Yet they are also growing anxious that he could face a draining primary of his own next year.Several prominent Trump antagonists are actively urging other Republicans to take on the president, and a popular governor, Larry Hogan of Maryland, has indicated he is newly open to their entreaties.In a sign of the White House\u2019s determination to project party unity, a top Trump campaign official, Bill Stepien, traveled to the Republican National Committee meeting in New Mexico this week to orchestrate an ornamental resolution of support for the president. It passed unanimously on Friday afternoon, hailing Mr. Trump for his \u201ceffective presidency\u201d even as his shutdown strategy collapsed.David Winston, a Republican pollster, said the burden was now on Mr. Trump to restore his stature as a leader by forging some kind of border-security deal with Democrats, and to deliver a stronger message on the economy.\u201cLeadership means results,\u201d Mr. Winston said. \u201cWhen you have a shutdown, people look at it, basically, as: the political system has failed.\u201dImageMr. Trump remains wholly focused on appeasing his conservative base, which makes up perhaps a third of the electorate.CreditGabriella Demczuk for The New York TimesMr. Winston said polling data suggested the border wall had been a problematic fight to pick. \u201cImmigration is an important issue,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cbut people are waking up every day trying to figure out how they\u2019re going to pay a set of bills in front of them.\u201dFor now, Mr. Trump remains wholly focused on appeasing his conservative base, comprising perhaps a third of the electorate, despite private G.O.P. polling suggesting that his agenda on immigration has failed to move the country in his favor, Republicans who work closely with the president said.But Mr. Trump emerged from the shutdown with nothing to show for it, having angered swing voters with his intransigence, while disappointing hard-line supporters by failing to secure any funding for a border wall.[Read about President Trump\u2019s retreat on the shutdown.]Conservatives still believe that Mr. Trump cannot afford to abandon his crusade for a barrier. Not long before Mr. Trump agreed to reopen the government, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a White House ally who leads the hard-line Freedom Caucus, argued that the wall fight was vital to the president\u2019s re-election hopes.\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on any of us that a central component of what he said when he ran in 2016 has to be addressed in a meaningful way,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Privately, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 aides have said they are pessimistic about his path to 270 electoral votes after his party\u2019s midterm defeats in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. An Associated Press poll on Wednesday showed that Mr. Trump\u2019s overall approval rating had fallen to 34 percent, with his support among Republicans dipping below 80 percent \u2014 a startling turn for a president who strives for total control of the G.O.P., and has usually achieved it.The Mueller investigation looms as another destabilizing force for the president. David Kochel, a Republican strategist based in Iowa who is opposed to Mr. Trump, said the special counsel\u2019s eventual report could determine whether Mr. Trump is vulnerable in a primary.\u201cThat will be a focusing mechanism for the party,\u201d Mr. Kochel said.While core Republican voters remain loyal to him and he is not currently facing a contest for the nomination, Mr. Trump\u2019s low standing with political moderates and especially women is leading some G.O.P. officeholders to voice unease about having him at the top of the ticket next year.\u201cI think it\u2019s healthy and appropriate for the party to consider in 2020 whether this is really the path it wants to continue taking,\u201d said David F. Holt, the Republican mayor of Oklahoma City, where a Democrat won a stunning House upset last year thanks in part to the suburban antipathy toward Mr. Trump.ImageGov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a popular centrist Republican who won re-election in November, has been courted to possibly run against Mr. Trump.CreditPatrick Semansky/Associated PressThe 2020 election is nearly two years away and Mr. Trump has ample time to build a political operation, marshal support from financial backers and make his case to the American people. Mr. Trump captured the presidency with a largely improvisational candidacy, guided by his own instincts for personal combat and cultural division, and lacking the strategic discipline of most presidential campaigns.But even among his own political lieutenants, there is a general recognition that Mr. Trump currently lacks anything resembling a positive message.Mr. Trump is especially fixated on two well-known Democrats, speaking frequently about Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president whom Mr. Trump regards as his most dangerous potential opponent, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Some of his advisers are more preoccupied with two other would-be challengers, who would offer a starker generational contrast with the 72-year-old president: Senator Kamala Harris of California and Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas Senate candidate.In this volatile moment, however, Mr. Trump and his aides have been just as focused on heading off competition from fellow Republicans. In addition to helping direct a resolution of support from the R.N.C. \u2014 Mr. Trump tweeted approvingly Saturday morning, suggesting re-election \u201cshould be easy\u2019\u2019 \u2014 Mr. Stepien, the former White House political director, has been leading an effort to ensure there is no insurrection at next year\u2019s convention in Charlotte, N.C.Now a top aide on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, Mr. Stepien and his deputies have been consulting party leaders about shutting off avenues to a challenge and ensuring that states cannot put forward \u201cfavorite son\u201d candidates to contest the president\u2019s renomination.Mr. Trump has also dedicated a team of aides to guaranteeing that only political loyalists are elected to serve as delegates to the convention. To that end, Mr. Stepien dispatched some of his staff members this month to see that their preferred candidate remained in charge of the Maine Republican Party.The fruits of some of those efforts were on display at the R.N.C. meeting outside Albuquerque, where enthusiasm for Mr. Trump was undimmed, at least publicly. The party leaders ignored Mr. Stone\u2019s arrest, which took place just hours before they gathered, and Ronna McDaniel, the party chair, did not deviate from her prepared remarks, lashing the media for promoting \u201cmanufactured scandals.\u201dJeff Kent, the party committeeman from Washington State, offered perhaps the most ferocious tribute to the president, brandishing his red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat as he addressed officials.\u201cTo the press in the back of the room,\u201d said Mr. Kent, his voice rising, \u201cplease go tell the world we will always proudly wear this hat and we will always proudly support our great president, Donald A. Trump.\u201d (The president\u2019s middle initial is \u201cJ.\u201d)ImageWhile core Republican voters remain loyal to Mr. Trump, his low standing with political moderates and especially women is leading some G.O.P. officeholders to voice unease about having him at the top of the ticket next year.CreditLeah Klafczynski for The New York TimesOther Republicans view Mr. Trump\u2019s political stumbles as an opportunity to lure a challenger into the race, with Mr. Hogan emerging as a new subject of their efforts. At a December conference hosted by the Niskanen Center, a right-of-center think tank, Mr. Hogan spoke briefly with William Kristol, an implacable Trump critic in the conservative press, who argued that the president is weaker than widely understood, people briefed on the conversation said.Mr. Hogan, 62, is set to meet more formally in the coming weeks with Mr. Kristol and Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist helping marshal opposition to Mr. Trump. Mr. Kristol and Ms. Longwell have been meeting with Republican donors and potential challengers, sharing focus-group and polling data about the president\u2019s vulnerability with what they call \u201cReluctant Trump Voters,\u201d according to a copy of their presentation reviewed by The New York Times.Mr. Hogan is planning a trip to Iowa in his capacity as an officer of the National Governors Association. But his advisers also recently reached out to Mr. Kochel, the Iowa-based strategist, to ask that he put together a dinner with similarly minded Republicans while Mr. Hogan is there, according to an associate of Mr. Kochel briefed on the exchange.Jerry Taylor, president of the Niskanen Center, said Mr. Hogan had \u201cmade it clear that the door is open to a potential candidacy, but no decision has been made.\u201dIn addition to Mr. Hogan, William F. Weld, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, is weighing a challenge to Mr. Trump as a small-government moderate, people who have spoken with him said. Mr. Weld, 73, who was the Libertarian Party\u2019s vice-presidential nominee in 2016, has discussed either opposing Mr. Trump in the Republican primaries or seeking the Libertarian presidential nomination.Mr. Weld declined to comment on his deliberations, and Mr. Hogan declined through an aide to be interviewed.Other Republicans known to be entertaining campaigns against Mr. Trump include John R. Kasich, the former governor of Ohio, who ran in 2016; Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska; and Jeff Flake, the former senator from Arizona. But Mr. Sasse is said to have grown uneasy about the idea, and Mr. Kasich and Mr. Flake are pursuing opportunities in television.Bruce Berke, a Republican strategist in New Hampshire aligned with Mr. Kasich, said he currently saw Mr. Trump as unassailable in a G.O.P. primary.\u201cA primary challenge in 2020, as of today, would be futile for anyone,\u201d Mr. Berke said.Still, Republican donors will want to know just how damaged the president may be by the end of this year before they truly commit to a challenge.Asked if he would be willing to raise money for a primary opponent to Mr. Trump, Stanley Druckenmiller, a New York-based investor who has given millions to Republican candidates, said, \u201cIf I thought such a candidate would be a good president and had a realistic chance of securing the nomination, yes, of course.\u201d"}, {"title": "On Politics: The Biggest Stories of the Week", "category": "Politics", "id": "83b22d49-b379-4977-81ef-8a72d0cff244", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/us/politics/biggest-stories-of-the-week.html", "publishdate": 20190126, "imageurl": "", "content": "From the shutdown\u2019s end to Roger Stone\u2019s indictment, it\u2019s been a busy week in American politics.

Mr. Trump indicated that if lawmakers cannot strike a deal by Feb. 15, he is prepared to close the government again.The shutdown\u2019s effects will linger, despite the reopening.

While other Democrats have focused on sweeping themes of unity or change, as Senator Kamala Harris of California did on Sunday at a campaign kickoff rally, Ms. Warren is making a personal and political wager that audiences care more about policy savvy than captivating oration.It is a bet intended to draw contrasts with President Trump, who rarely delves into policy, but also to put pressure on Democratic rivals. In what promises to be a nomination contest featuring many candidates with broadly similar ideologies, a strategy of highlighting even the smallest differences in policy could pay off, especially with liberal voters who want firm and thorough positions rather than squishy generalities that could be setups for compromise.\u201cThere will be a lot of diagnosing of problems in the Trump era, and it\u2019s important to have a Democratic candidate who has the correct diagnosis of a fundamentally corrupt economic and political system,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has been openly supportive of Ms. Warren. \u201cBut voters \u2014 especially voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states that have the ability to get to know these candidates well \u2014 they want to hear real solutions, and that means a certain level of detail and not just platitudes.\u201dImageMs. Warren is digging deep into specifics, making a personal and political wager that audiences like one in Columbia, S.C., are more interested in policy savvy than captivating oration.CreditTravis Dove for The New York TimesOn one level Ms. Warren is running as herself: a former Harvard law professor who likes getting into the weeds of policy. She is also trying to avoid the political trap of adopting a poll-tested, all-things-to-all-people persona and coming off as inauthentic. But some Democrats say she runs the risk of being seen as out of touch and too intellectual and offbeat.Patrick Morgan, a Nebraska resident who attended Ms. Warren\u2019s recent event in Council Bluffs, Iowa, said he wished she had more \u201ccharisma\u201d and \u201cenergy.\u201d David Briggs, who attended a Warren event in Des Moines, said he worried about her ability to go beyond traditional issues and inspire the country.\u201cI\u2019d love for her to just go straight into office, but I worry she can\u2019t bring people together and beat the Republican Party,\u201d Mr. Briggs said.Ms. Warren\u2019s political strategists believe that after years of Mr. Trump\u2019s leaning on catchphrases and easy-to-digest proposals like \u201cbuild the wall,\u201d Democrats want a nominee who articulates a detailed vision for America. They point to the 2018 midterm elections, where several successful Democratic candidates talked at length about issues and tried to engage voters directly by their favorite means: streaming themselves on Instagram Live in some cases, expounding on bankruptcy law in others.The way Ms. Warren talks, she lets voters know \u201cshe\u2019s not just blowing hot air,\u201d said Ben Wikler, Washington director for the liberal group MoveOn. \u201cShe has her arms totally wrapped around the problems she\u2019s discussing.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an adage in comedy that you want jokes that reward the people who get them, but don\u2019t punish the people who don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Wikler added. \u201cPolicy details in politics works the same way.

The result: extended riffs about Puerto Rican debt restructuring, the history of denying black Americans access to mortgage subsidies, renewable energy policies like net metering and the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2018.\u201cYou want me to get this crowd up on net metering?\u201d Ms. Warren called out to a New Hampshire audience this month, referring to a system in which solar panels or other green energy generators are connected to a public-utility power grid. \u201cDo I have any net metering wonks out here?

Past presidential candidates in both parties have grappled with this.ImageMs. Warren was the first major Democratic candidate to enter the presidential race and begin touring early primary states.CreditTravis Dove for The New York TimesRepublicans and Democrats alike tried to portray Hillary Clinton as inauthentic in her 2016 and 2008 runs for president, invoking her paid speeches to Wall Street firms and her earlier vote in support of the Iraq war. And many of Republicans who ran in 2016 also struggled to define themselves and not have Mr. Trump do the job for them; his pejorative nicknames for rivals like \u201cLow Energy\u201d Jeb Bush, \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d and \u201cLiddle Marco\u201d did political damage.Mr. Trump is already trying to do the same to Ms. Warren by slurring her as \u201cPocahontas\u201d and casting her as too liberal for the American electorate. But her tendency to embrace her inner wonk predates that nickname and is not a newly conjured attempt to push back at him.Ms. Warren was the first major candidate to enter the presidential race and begin touring early primary states, and it remains to be seen which of her fellow Democratic candidates will prioritize laying out a policy-driven vision for voters to latch onto and which will ground their candidacy on their supposed ability to beat Mr. Trump.Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is considering a second presidential run, upended the Democratic Party by running in 2016 on bold promises such as single-payer health insurance and tuition-free college, yet he rarely strays from his favored set of issues. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., also considering a 2020 run, has so far grounded his pitch to voters in electability, telling one Democrat, \u201cI don\u2019t see the candidate who can clearly do what has to be done to win.\u201dEven a fresh national face like Ms. Harris, who announced her presidential candidacy last week, has taken a more cautious approach to campaigning at her first three events. On Friday, Ms. Harris spoke at a ticketed gala for members of her collegiate sorority, she hosted a kickoff rally in Oakland on Sunday afternoon and she is set to participate in a CNN-moderated town-hall-style meeting in Iowa on Monday night.Faiz Shakir, national political director for the American Civil Liberties Union, said candidates would be wise to mimic Ms. Warren\u2019s willingness to focus on policy. On Thursday, Ms. Warren announced a plan that would impose a new annual tax on the 75,000 wealthiest families in the United States. The proposal would raise $2.75 trillion in tax revenue over a decade, according to calculations by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two University of California-Berkeley economists who consulted with Ms. Warren on the plan.\u201cElizabeth Warren is trying to position herself as the ideas candidate of the field, and thus far, in the early going, she\u2019s winning that,\u201d Mr. Shakir said. \u201cOthers should start thinking about competing in the arena for new ideas.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: Your Davos Cheat Sheet", "category": "Business", "id": "602826c8-9ee9-45ec-a9dc-9c7b5fe84384", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/business/dealbook/davos-world-economic-forum-wrapup.html", "publishdate": 20190127, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/28/business/28db-merkel/merlin_149630352_d3c6d358-a80d-47e0-853a-d800be59dc61-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Sunday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)Tim Cook, Matt Damon, economic worries and social unrestThe week of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is a fire hose of news. Headlines, predictions, sightings and tidbits that months and years later are recognized as the flash point for much larger shifts and trends can often get overlooked.To help you sort through it all, we\u2019ve put together this crib sheet of everything that we think was important that happened here in Davos. (Yes, I\u2019m writing this from Davos on my way home.)Before we get into the substance, a couple of observations.The World Economic Forum has traditionally brought together the world\u2019s top political and business leaders. But this year, the political leaders were largely absent \u2014 remaining in their home countries to handle crises largely of their own making (President Trump with the shutdown and Prime Minister Theresa May with Brexit).The surprise guest this year was Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, making his first appearance; it may be an indication of Apple\u2019s increasing dependence on foreign markets for growth.The topic du jour (besides the shutdown) was a debate over where the global economy was headed. Chief executives professed confidence that their earnings would continue apace, while economists and investors talked about the prospect of a recession in 2020. And others, like Ray Dalio \u2014 and Seth Klarman, who did not attend, but whose annual letter was a constant talking point \u2014 worried about social unrest. Interestingly, Dr. Doom \u2014 Nouriel Roubini \u2014 was actually upbeat.A Chinese chief executive described his country\u2019s economy as \u201cugly\u201d \u2014 he used that world repeatedly \u2014 suggesting that the underlying foundation there was more fragile than most economists acknowledge. That could lead to weakness in China spreading to the rest of the world. And the general sense is that while the U.S. and China may reach a trade d\u00e9tente, we might be headed for a decades-long economic cold war.Larry Fink\u2019s letter and the concept of E.S.G., shorthand for \u201cenvironmental, social and governance,\u201d got a lot of discussion this year \u2014 it felt like it might be a tipping point in the dialogue. European companies are still more interested in E.S.G. than U.S. companies, but it feels like a trend that isn\u2019t going away. TPG\u2019s Rise Fund started a new company, Y Analytics, to measure E.S.G. Bono, a board member of Rise, was on hand to talk about impact investing and to support his Red brand, which he started a decade ago in Davos (DealBook broke that story at the time) as well as his One franchise. Matt Damon was in town to raise money for his water.org, which is turning into a quite successful story (side note: Mr. Damon had to borrow a suit because his bag got lost by Swiss Air). Jane Goodall was also in Davos \u2014 and let me say that she is as nice as she is important. Even the Vatican sent a delegation to talk about conscious and inclusive capitalism.And Rebecca Blumenstein, the deputy managing editor of The New York Times, interviewed Bill Gates on Twitter about his work around the globe.____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Davos, Switzerland; Stephen Grocer in New York; and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The U.S. versus China: It\u2019s not a trade war, it\u2019s a tech warThe soap opera of tariff negotiations has riveted economists and executives: Will Beijing keep its promises? Will Washington cooperate?But the real drama is not about trade, but about technology, many in Davos have said. The brewing conflict could affect generations and disrupt the world order, according to Fred Kempe, the chief executive of the think tank Atlantic Council. He wrote:The growing danger is that the tech race could become the primary battleground in a struggle between democracy and autocracy \u2014 and between China and the U.S. The dangers of a technological Cold War, a zero-sum contest for global dominance that ultimately separates Chinese and U.S. tech sectors from each other and divides up the world, are increasing.What\u2019s the worry? The billionaire George Soros said that artificial intelligence, when in the hands of authoritarian regimes, was a \u201cmortal threat\u201d to the world. He cited China, which is developing a social credit system that would use personal data to judge an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, as an example. President Xi Jinping could eventually have \u201ctotal control over the people,\u201d making him \u201cthe most dangerous opponent of open societies,\u201d Mr. Soros said.What do the Chinese think? The technology industry relies heavily on global interactions and is \u201cprobably suffering the most right now,\u201d said Ken Hu, the deputy chairman of Huawei. The Chinese telecommunications company has been accused by multiple nations, including the U.S., of violating trade rules. Other players, such as the Chinese state-owned oil and gas company Sinopec, say they expect Chinese companies to scale back foreign investment \u2014 steps already taken by Alibaba and by GAC Motor. Last year, nearly 60 percent of Chinese C.E.O.s considered the U.S. to be the most important foreign market; this year, only 17 percent feel the same, according to one survey published this past week.Hope for resolution? Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said via video link that Washington was willing to play nice with Beijing if China pledged to protect intellectual property. At a dinner in Davos, a top Chinese regulator heard complaints from international business leaders about the ownership structure of state-owned enterprises and about the Made in China 2025 effort, which aims to take the lead in industries such as artificial intelligence and robotics.But China wants its space. Vice President Wang Qishan said in a speech that \u201cit is imperative to respect national sovereignty and refrain from seeking technological hegemony.\u201d He added:We need to respect the independent choices of model of technology management and of public policies made by countries, and their right to participating in the global technological governance system as equals.More forecasts for a global economic slowdownA recession may not be coming this year, but neither is a boom, Greg Ip of the WSJ writes.The International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2019 forecast for global growth to 3.5 percent. That\u2019s a respectable number, he writes, but the world is struggling to sustain even that muted pace.The reason: The world cannot tolerate interest rates as high as it once did. The \u201cneutral\u201d interest rate \u2014 one that is high enough to contain inflation, yet low enough to avoid recession \u2014 is much lower than before.The underlying cause: As aging workers retire and birthrates drop, the labor force has grown more slowly. Productivity has also eked out smaller gains than in the past.The upshot: Central banks need to proceed carefully, because a little fiscal tightening goes a long way.More on the global economy: Ray Dalio, founder and chairman of the hedge fund Bridgewater, said he foresaw slower growth rates in the U.S. and Europe. France is sticking to a 1.7 percent economic growth forecast for 2019, the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., warned against an overreliance on central banks, urging countries to strengthen their economies through fiscal and structural changes. In the absence of world leaders, the atmosphere was downbeat.ImageRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.CreditAndrew Harnik/Associated PressTax the richAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez wasn\u2019t in Davos this week. It just felt like she was.The New York representative\u2019s proposal to impose a 70 percent tax rate on income above $10 million came up frequently among the uber-wealthy in attendance.In those elite circles, filled with people whose fortunes have soared in recent years, the idea was not popular.Michael Dell, the billionaire founder of Dell Technologies, is not a fan, for one. Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners, said the concept was \u201cscary.\u201d Glenn Hutchins, the chairman of North Island and a co-founder of Silver Lake Partners, suggested that it was an attempt to \u201cscore political points\u201d and that it would probably be unsuccessful. Ken Moelis, the chief executive of the investment bank Moelis & Company, said it would be \u201cdisastrous for the economy.\u201dStephen Schwarzman, the billionaire chief executive of Blackstone, said he was \u201cwildly enthusiastic\u201d about Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s pitch. (He was being sarcastic.)But as the economy slows and 2020 election talk surges, taxing the rich is a topic that will most likely continue to surface. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic candidate for president, proposed a so-called ultramillionaire tax this week on the 75,000 wealthiest families in the country, including President Trump\u2019s.Still, top earners would probably figure out how to sidestep such rules, Mr. Minerd said.The political pendulum is swinging. The conservatives found out they\u2019re being held hostage by the extreme right. Now the Democrats are going to find out they\u2019re being held hostage by the extreme left.Defending the international orderGlobalization had some powerful defenders in Davos, with world leaders imploring delegates not to abandon postwar principles of international integration.Several took jabs at the absent President Trump without mentioning him by name, criticizing his \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy and his habit of provoking trade disputes. The vice president of China, Wang Qishan, whose own country has been accused of running roughshod over foreign competitors and global business rules, nonetheless condemned \u201cpractices of the strong bullying the weak and self-claimed supremacy.\u201dCarrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, said that certain countries were drifting from the multilateral framework of the past few decades.\u201cIf that is no longer the mainstream, we could be in trouble,\u201d she said.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who leads a country that is deeply reliant on international trade and increasingly surrounded by neighbors confronted by protectionist tendencies, urged Western powers to \u201cact against the fragmentation of the international architecture.\u201dShe said that global organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank should be reformed and that countries should embrace compromise. She added:I think we should understand our national interest in a way that we think about the interests of others, and from that create win-win situations that are the precondition for multilateralism.Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, pledged his country\u2019s support for \u201cthe free, open, and rules-based international order.\u201d He called on forum participants to \u201crebuild trust toward the system for international trade.\u201dA call for greater oversight of Big TechWorld leaders called for more regulation. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said his country would push for a new international system for the oversight of data use.His proposal was echoed by others:\u2022 The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said African Union leaders would discuss greater oversight of the tech sector at a meeting early next month.\u2022 Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany cited a need for the European Union to have a \u201ccommon digital market.\u201d\u2022 Vice President Wang Qishan of China also said that more international cooperation in regulating the market was required.Talk focused on global governance, data privacy and the impact of artificial intelligence, but there was no consensus on what approach to take. Some official sessions tried to put a positive spin on the effects of technological advances, but the optimism seemed out of step with public concern about the disruptive effect on privacy and politics.Tech leaders make the rounds: On his first trip to the forum, Tim Cook, the Apple chief executive, met with world leaders, including President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Dubai\u2019s crown prince, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, acknowledged that her company needed to earn back the trust of the public. Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Satya Nadella, said that as facial recognition technology grew, he would \u201cwelcome regulation that will help the marketplace not be a race to the bottom.\u201dThe milkman makes a comebackEnvironmental issues took center stage, with world leaders and celebrities weighing in and new partnerships being formed. One of the biggest initiatives announced at the forum was an alternative recycling platform called Loop, which seeks to change the way consumers buy brand-name products.The concept: The project revives the milkman concept, in which products are delivered in reusable containers that are returned to the manufacturer.The partners: Some of the largest consumer goods companies \u2014 including Danone, Mars Petcare, Mondelez International, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Unilever \u2014 are working together on the project as a way to limit waste.The pitchman: Tom Szaky, founder and chief executive of the recycling company TerraCycle, headed to Davos two years ago to meet with the leaders of packaged goods companies and push his big idea.Climate concerns dominated much of the discussion elsewhere at the gathering:\u2022 In an interview with Prince William, the naturalist David Attenborough took world leaders to task for waiting too long to address climate change.\u2022 Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand joined the chorus, urging her global counterparts to think about the role they play in addressing climate change, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan called for action on the issue.\u2022 The singer Bono poked fun at sustainable development goals, saying, \u201cThe S.D.G.s, it does sound like a sexually transmitted disease, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u2022 An expected drop in private jet traffic to Davos this year could be a sign that participants are taking the environmental impact of their travel more seriously.\u2022 Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old climate activist from Sweden, gave a speech urging the global elite to protect the planet.The best of the rest\u2022 Forum participants seemed receptive to Saudi Arabia\u2019s damage control campaign over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. (Reuters)\u2022The World Economic Forum hosts 3,000 official participants, but the population of Davos swells to 30,000 during the week. Here are the unaffiliated events, sessions and parties that drew celebrities like Matt Damon and Wyclef Jean. (CNBC)\u2022 The Bank of England is ready for Brexit and is disillusioned with Bitcoin, said its governor, Mark Carney. (Bloomberg)\u2022 Hundreds of protesters, some waving signs that read \u201cLet them eat money,\u201d complained that the elite participants at Davos cared more about the bottom line than about the state of the world.

Its app is pink. Its cars were once adorned with fuzzy bubblegum-colored mustaches. Its drivers have a reputation for being friendly. And while Lyft has racked up more than one billion rides and become a strong No. 2 to Uber in the United States and Canada, it has not shaken off its cuddly image.Now Mr. Green, 35, must show that Lyft can be as assertive as an Amazon or a Facebook. He and Uber are locked in a race to take their companies public: Both filed papers in December to list on the stock market in the coming months. The offerings \u2014 the first for any ride-hailing firm \u2014 are likely to create a bonanza of riches in Silicon Valley and set the stage for listings of other highly valued tech start-ups, including Slack and Pinterest.The pressure is on Mr. Green to get the jump on Uber. (Both offerings have been stalled because the government shutdown, which ended Friday, prevented the Securities and Exchange Commission from reviewing their filings.) Lyft, which was last privately valued at $15.1 billion, is tiny compared with its rival and could be overshadowed if Uber debuts first. Uber could go public at a $120 billion valuation.For Mr. Green, this means he may have to give up some up his reserve and step into a more public role. While Lyft\u2019s more gregarious president, John Zimmer, his No. 2 for the last 12 years, has frequently handled the public-facing side of the business, Mr. Green would rather speak at staff meetings than at tech conferences. Colleagues describe him as reserved.In a 2017 interview, Mr. Zimmer said Mr. Green was often misunderstood because of his quiet demeanor. \u201cHe is, like, extremely competitive,\u201d Mr. Zimmer, now 34, said. \u201cHe has been an activist.\u201dLyft declined to make Mr. Green or Mr. Zimmer available for new interviews, citing the quiet period before an initial public offering. In a statement, the chief operating officer, Jon McNeill, described them as \u201ccutthroat missionaries in service of creating positive change.\u201dOne of the tech leaders Mr. Green cited as inspiration, Mr. Musk, recommended against taking Lyft public.\u201cThe current system makes long-term value creation and product innovation difficult,\u201d Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla, wrote in an email last week. \u201cIt insists on quarter-by-quarter results or punishes companies severely. This is particularly bad for companies that are high growth and are valued on potential, like Lyft (or Tesla).\u201d (The S.E.C. fined Mr. Musk  last year for a tweet about taking Tesla private.)Mr. Green, who was born and raised in Culver City, Calif., graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2006 with a degree in business economics. He then worked as the university\u2019s sustainability coordinator, poring over alternatives to the gas-guzzling one-car-per-owner model. He was also on the board of the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District, a position that gave him insight into municipal transportation.While visiting Zimbabwe on vacation during his 20s, Mr. Green said in the 2017 interview, he was inspired by Zimbabweans who had created makeshift services to fill every seat in car pools, saving passengers money and taking cars off the road.So in 2007, Mr. Green started Zimride in Santa Barbara, Calif., to provide long-distance car-pool rides to college students by matching them with other students who were driving.Mr. Zimmer, then working at Lehman Brothers, noticed posts about the start-up on Facebook from John Siegel, whom he had met while studying abroad and who had attended middle school with Mr. Green.ImageMr. Green and John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s president, in 2016. Mr. Zimmer called Mr. Green \u201cextremely competitive\u201d despite his quiet demeanor.CreditRamin Talaie for The New York Times\u201cJohn didn\u2019t have this technical or programming background, but he was this really impressive guy,\u201d Mr. Siegel said. \u201cI thought they could work together well.\u201dMr. Green and Mr. Zimmer, who remained in New York, embarked on what Mr. Zimmer called a \u201clong-distance relationship,\u201d working together over Skype. In 2008, they moved to a two-bedroom apartment in Palo Alto, Calif. Neither drew a salary in the first three years of building Zimride, and each contract they sold to a college was celebrated with a trip to Ikea for Swedish meatballs, Mr. Zimmer said.In 2011, Zimride raised $6 million. But as a web service, it was caught flat-footed by the rise of smartphones and mobile apps. In 2012, Mr. Green decided to spin out of Zimride a mobile, peer-to-peer ride-hailing service, calling it Lyft.Instead of just pairing students for long-distance rides, Lyft would put drivers together with riders on public streets, in real time. Mr. Zimmer came up with the idea to emblazon the cars with pink mustaches; Mr. Green encouraged passengers to greet their drivers with a fist bump, to keep the community feeling of Zimride.At the time, ride-hailing wasn\u2019t legal, and only licensed drivers could pick up passengers on public streets. Ann Miura-Ko, a partner at the venture capital firm Floodgate, who had invested in Zimride and sits on Lyft\u2019s board, recalled that some board members had been doubtful about the change \u2014 but that Mr. Green had been confident.\u201cSomeone asked, \u2018Will this really work?\u2019 And he wasn\u2019t just sure, he was positive,\u201d she said.But Mr. Green didn\u2019t reckon with one issue: Uber. At the time, Uber, run by Travis Kalanick, had positioned itself as a luxury service for the wealthy that used only licensed drivers, unlike Lyft\u2019s lower-cost service. In 2013, Uber published a white paper outlining the risks of peer-to-peer ride-hailing, a way to elbow Lyft out of the market.\u201cThey were trying to get the whole category shut down behind the scenes,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want competition.\u201dUber officials met with California regulators about the matter. As for Mr. Green, several current and former regulators and lawmakers who oversee ride-sharing in California said they had never worked with him, because Mr. Zimmer was often the one who communicated with officials.\u201cTruth be told, I\u2019ve never heard of him,\u201d said Aaron Peskin, a San Francisco supervisor who called for crackdowns on Uber and Lyft in their early years and negotiated a new per-ride tax with Uber and Lyft last summer.Mr. Kalanick eventually moved Uber into non-luxury ride-sharing with no licensed drivers, the same as Lyft. He and Mr. Green quickly became bitter rivals. When Mr. Green was set to introduce Lyft\u2019s car-pooling product in 2014, Uber announced the same service first.That same year, Uber considered buying Lyft. Over dinner at Mr. Kalanick\u2019s home in San Francisco, the Uber chief laughed at Mr. Zimmer\u2019s high asking price. No deal was struck.An Uber spokesman declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Kalanick didn\u2019t return a request for comment.While Mr. Kalanick went on to raise billions of dollars in funding for Uber, Mr. Green relied on Mr. Zimmer\u2019s Wall Street knowledge and showman personality to garner investments from venture capitalists and others. In total, Lyft has raised close to $5.1 billion, compared with Uber\u2019s roughly $14 billion in equity.In 2017, Mr. Kalanick was ousted from Uber after a series of scandals. Mr. Green seized the moment, billing Lyft as a kinder, gentler network. Ridership surged, with Lyft taking a share of up to 35 percent in some American cities.More recently, Lyft has ventured into self-driving cars, offering autonomous rides in Las Vegas. It also acquired Motivate, the largest bike-share operator in the United States, giving Lyft a dominant position in an emerging transportation market.In the 2017 interview, Mr. Green said he was far from done.\u201cAs an entrepreneur, you always kind of want what you\u2019re pitching to sound somewhat off the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to pitch the future that doesn\u2019t exist, and you want it to be \u2014 it needs to be \u2014 a little bit of a stretch.\u201d"}, {"title": "The Tabloid Myths of Jennifer Aniston and Donald Trump", "category": "Business", "id": "94a84ea1-eed2-407f-98ed-b300d3875d97", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/business/media/jennifer-aniston-donald-trump-tabloid-media-pregnancy.html", "publishdate": 20190127, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/21/business/21Rutenberg-01/merlin_139411716_38b1053d-5b76-4ac9-aca2-12284bb7e91b-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "In a depressing news cycle, the cover of In Touch Weekly\u2019s Jan. 21 issue was a beautiful sight.It was a blast from a less complicated past, with its vintage photograph of a beaming Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt staring out at readers from above the bold headline: \u201cWe\u2019re Having a Girl!\u201dFor some who saw it in the racks, me included, the cover of this supermarket tabloid provided a double dose of joy. Not only was the It Couple of the late 1990s and early aughts back together \u2014 they were about to be parents.But wait a minute.The story rang a bell, and when I looked into it, I found that In Touch had devoted its cover to a similar piece of news back in October, with a story headlined \u201cBrad & Jen Baby Announcement! \u2018Our Dream Finally Came True!\u2019\u201d That one included the persuasive-seeming detail that the father-to-be was \u201cdesigning the nursery in their new home.\u201dAnd what about that other time Ms. Aniston was pregnant? In July, the In Touch cover promised, \u201cBombshell Pregnancy News!\u201d \u2014 and that was just the icing atop the wedding cake of the headline \u201cBrad & Jen: Just Married! Inside the Backyard Ceremony.\u201dBefore that, in May, OK! magazine, which shares an owner with In Touch, American Media Inc., ran a cover photo of a happy Ms. Aniston and Mr. Pitt with the headline: \u201cYes, I\u2019m Pregnant \u2014 With Brad\u2019s Baby!\u201dGoing by the tabloid reports, I found that Ms. Aniston should have given birth to some two dozen babies in the last few years. According to OK! alone, she has acquired up to 15 kids since 2013, having been pregnant nine times \u2014 twice with twins! \u2014 while also adopting a third set of twins.ImageFalse. False. False. The denials have not stopped In Touch magazine from going with a story that sells.The website Gossip Cop has debunked some of the above-mentioned reports. And when I called Ms. Aniston\u2019s publicist, Stephen Huvane, he confirmed that she was not pregnant. He also said that Ms. Aniston has no children and \u2014 it pains me to reveal \u2014 she is not back together with Mr. Pitt, who was her husband from 2000 to 2005.The publicist sounded more than a little weary of dealing with the tabloids.\u201cEvery week I get these emails, \u2018We\u2019re working on a story that Jennifer is pregnant,\u2019\u201d Mr. Huvane said. \u201cI will say, \u2018This is a complete fabrication. There\u2019s no truth to this or this is all ridiculous and completely false.\u2019 And they still go with the story.\u201dIt\u2019s no mystery why In Touch and OK! keep printing these false stories. At a time when gossip magazines are suffering right along with more serious publications and digital outlets, they no longer have the reporting ranks they once relied on to dig up real celebrity scoops.And these days they are careful to go with stories that sell. What\u2019s strange, though, is that some of us keep coming back for more, despite their abysmal track record.Whether the subject is celebrities or politics, readers can be easy marks for comforting tales. Tabloid publishers know this. So do online trolls and click-hungry websites.\u201cAlgorithmic behavior existed long before there was an algorithm,\u201d said Janice Min, the former top editor of The Hollywood Reporter and before that, Us Weekly, which she established as a place for real celebrity exclusives.ImageMr. Pitt and Ms. Aniston in 2004.

And baby makes three (or 18).Never mind that Ms. Aniston herself finds that view of a woman\u2019s happiness to be offensive. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be married or mothers to be complete,\u201d she wrote in 2016 HuffPost essay that debunked the endless false tabloid reports about her love life and supposed pregnancies.\u201cWith Jennifer Aniston, you have to start with the fundamental thing that people like her, and they\u2019re pulling for her,\u201d said Larry Hackett, the former editor of People magazine. \u201cThey would like to see her have the baby, because they\u2019re operating under this archaic, old-fashioned notion that without a baby she must be unhappy.\u201dMr. Hackett sagely noted that the mix of reality and fantasy contained in the Aniston story line isn\u2019t all that different from the contrived, highly edited versions of reality presented by \u201cunscripted\u201d shows like \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d still going strong in its 15th season. More important for the purposes of this column, it\u2019s not all that different from a onetime stalwart of the genre, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201dAs Patrick Radden Keefe wrote in a recent article on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d for The New Yorker, Donald J. Trump\u2019s star had dimmed in the years before it aired. By papering over his business organizations\u2019 bankruptcies, not to mention the fraud accusations against Trump University, the NBC prime-time hit \u201cmythologized him anew, turning him into an icon of American success.\u201dImageAn advertisement for \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d on Trump Tower in New York in 2004. As a recent article in The New Yorker put it, the NBC show with Donald Trump \u201cmythologized him anew, turning him into an icon of American success.\u201dCreditBebeto Matthews/Associated PressMr. Trump ran his campaign and at times runs his White House with a reliance on the same mix of fantasy and truthiness typical of supermarket tabloids and reality TV. Just as a large group of people can\u2019t get enough of the tales about Ms. Aniston, a large constituency seems eager to believe a reality-show narrative about the 45th president.On \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d he was a straight-shooting, street-smart businessman. To rally-goers during his campaign, he was the outsider who sought to smash a calcified ruling elite. As president, he has been the man willing to fight off resistance from \u201cthe deep state\u201d to do what\u2019s right, even if it means shutting down the government.In this scenario, the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III plays the role filled by Ms. Jolie in the Aniston saga \u2014 the foil who thrives on thwarting our protagonist.Just as I have found myself tempted to believe the Pregnant Jen story line, the president\u2019s fans seem more than willing to embrace this version of reality \u2014 a story line that has been fleshed out by The National Enquirer, his unignorable Twitter feed, his Fox News cheering section (Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, the gang at \u201cFox & Friends\u201d), his radio boosters (Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin), and his longtime adviser Roger Stone, who fed a new \u201cdeep state\u201d theory to Infowars a week before his arrest on Friday.The desire to believe helps explain polls like the one from Quinnipiac late last year reporting that 83 percent of Republicans view Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d despite the string of indictments, convictions and guilty pleas that preceded the charges against Mr. Stone.Driving the belief in political conspiracy theories and celebrity pregnancies alike is \u201ca desire to have the truth fit\u201d the heart\u2019s desires, said Ren\u00e9e Ann Cramer, a professor of law, politics and society at Drake University in Iowa. \u201cThey want it to be true,\u201d she said.Ms. Cramer is well positioned to connect the dots between the coverage of Ms. Aniston and Mr. Trump. In addition to her public policy expertise, she is the author of \u201cPregnant With the Stars: Watching and Wanting the Celebrity Baby Bump.\u201dAn attractive narrative emits a powerful force, whether it\u2019s about politics or things less serious, and we\u2019re all susceptible to its allure. Here\u2019s hoping the truth will prove more powerful than what people want to believe when Mr. Mueller issues his report."}, {"title": "Government Shutdown Is Over, So Where Is the Economic Data?", "category": "Business", "id": "0012e67a-9b14-41ac-be6f-8ad9ec00613a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/business/economy/economy-government-shutdown.html", "publishdate": 20190128, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/29/business/29econdata01/merlin_149303004_e0e53f3a-f784-446e-965e-a18a17f8e209-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The government is back. Government data, however, will have to wait awhile.The partial government shutdown left forecasters, investors and policymakers without much of the data they rely on \u2014 just as concerns were mounting that the United States\u2019 decade-long economic expansion could be nearing its end.Now that the monthlong shutdown is over, it will take government statisticians time to collect and analyze delayed figures for retail sales, manufacturing, housing and other parts of the economy. On Monday, the Commerce Department said it would not be able to release an estimate of gross domestic product for the fourth quarter that had been scheduled for Wednesday.That means that when officials gather Tuesday and Wednesday for a meeting of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, they will do so without access to much of the information they usually have. The timing is awkward: Fed officials have emphasized in recent months that with the economy\u2019s direction uncertain, they will be paying particularly close attention to the latest data when making decisions on interest rates and related matters.\u201cThe F.O.M.C. have told us that policy has become increasingly data dependent, but what data?\u201d said Joel Prakken, chief United States economist for Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm.In practice, the central bank had already indicated that it did not plan to raise rates at this week\u2019s meeting. But it isn\u2019t just the Fed that is struggling with the lack of government reports. Economists, investors and business leaders have all been left without a clear view of the economy.\u201cWe\u2019re missing a lot of key releases at a time when the economy appears to be slowing,\u201d said Nancy Vanden Houten, senior economist for Oxford Economics. \u201cWe\u2019re missing data on retail sales at a time when it would be great to see if the shutdown is having an impact on consumer spending. We\u2019re not getting trade data at a time when we\u2019re in a trade conflict with China.\u201d[READ MORE: What\u2019s Happening in the Economy? Here\u2019s a Guide to the Data]The shutdown, which idled hundreds of thousands of federal workers and disrupted operations across the country, will also have a direct effect on the economy. The Congressional Budget Office on Monday estimated the economic cost at $11 billion, although much of that will eventually be recovered as operations resume.Economists haven\u2019t been flying completely blind. The Labor Department was unaffected by the shutdown, which meant that the Bureau of Labor Statistics was able to collect and release inflation, unemployment and hiring estimates as usual. The monthly jobs report, arguably the most closely watched indicator each month, will come out Friday as planned. And economists still had access to privately collected statistics on housing, consumer sentiment and other topics.Still, the pause in funding mostly shuttered the Commerce Department, which houses the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Census Bureau. That resulted in the delay of several closely watched reports. Last week, the Conference Board published its index of leading indicators \u2014 meant to be a sort of early-warning system for downturns in the economy \u2014 without three of its usual 10 components.It isn\u2019t clear how long it will take government releases to get back on schedule. The answer will probably vary: Data on building permits, for example, is collected by local officials and submitted to the Census Bureau; as a result, the government should be able to gather the information and produce estimates relatively quickly. Retail sales figures, however, are based on a monthly survey that wasn\u2019t conducted during the shutdown.The trickiest report is also arguably the most important: gross domestic product. The broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy, G.D.P. is based on more than a dozen indicators, including several of the reports that were delayed. That means the government won\u2019t be able to produce its estimate until nearly all the other data has been collected.The Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Monday it would not release G.D.P. data this week and would also delay three other reports scheduled for this week and next, including statistics on consumer spending and international trade. The agency said it was consulting with the Census Bureau and other agencies and could not \u201csay anything definitive about release dates\u201d at this time.It is possible the Commerce Department could end up skipping the initial estimate of G.D.P. and wait until late February, when it would ordinarily release the first of two revised estimates. That\u2019s what happened after the 1995-96 shutdown, the previous record-holder for the longest shutdown.The greater risk is that the delays in data collection could hurt the quality of the statistics once they are produced. Government surveys are meant to be conducted the same way, at the same time each month, to ensure that the data are consistent over time. Changes can raise the risk of errors, said Maurine Haver, president of Haver Analytics, a data provider.\u201cSurveys just simply aren\u2019t being done, and in some cases will never be replicated,\u201d Ms. Haver said.Economists said the shutdown had most likely ended before serious damage was done. Most major releases will be delayed by weeks, not months. Still, disruptions like these could have longer-run consequences for the confidence people have in government statistics, said Tara Sinclair, an economics professor at George Washington University.\u201cThe U.S. is really considered the gold standard in data for the rest of the world, and we\u2019re kind of falling down on our job here,\u201d she said."}, {"title": "What\u2019s Happening in the Economy?

The lift to corporate profits from the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts is waning, the United States is in the middle of a risky trade war with China, growth in some of the world\u2019s biggest economies is slowing, and interest rates are off record lows.The nation\u2019s longest government shutdown, which ended Friday, has made the picture murkier. The Commerce Department, home to the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, was closed during the shutdown. That means reports on the gross domestic product, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation measure, business investment and retail sales have been delayed.Read more about the impact of the shutdown on economic reports:Government Shutdown Is Over, So Where Is the Economic Data?Jan. 28, 2019While 800,00 government workers and contractors went without pay, most economists do not expect lasting damage to the economy from the shutdown. Still, it probably hurt business and consumer spending and, in the short term, will affect economic data released in the coming weeks. That will require investors to parse the reports to determine what was a temporary hit from the shutdown and what is evidence of a slowing economy. Here\u2019s a rough guide to the elements of the economy that investors are focused on and the data that helps shape their views.The labor market is the linchpinData releases: Jobs report, Jolts, initial jobless claimsTo investors, there is perhaps no more important economic release each month than the jobs report. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate \u2014 keeping prices stable and Americans employed \u2014 and this report offers insight into both factors.On Friday, the government will release its monthly hiring and unemployment figures for January. Because furloughed government employees will receive back pay, the shutdown is unlikely to affect payrolls but could push the unemployment rate higher.There\u2019s another important figure from the report to watch: wage growth. The average hourly earnings for workers had grown slowly during the recovery from the financial crisis, but has ticked up in recent months.That comes with its own complications. Historically when wage growth is strong, inflation picks up. The Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, and his two immediate predecessors raised questions about the connection this month, but a big jump in wage growth this year could make investors nervous that it will lead to inflation or push the Fed to raise interest rates.Investors will keep an eye on two other labor market releases: the monthly Jolts (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) report and the weekly initial jobless claims. The two reports offer indications of job vacancies and layoffs.Inflation could eat into profitsData releases: Personal consumption expenditures, Consumer Price IndexThere are two main measures of inflation: the Consumer Price Index and the personal consumption expenditures, or P.C.E., price index, which the Fed has indicated is its preferred measure of inflation. After rising above the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent earlier last year, both have pulled back in recent months.In December, the Consumer Price Index rose 1.9 percent annually because of lower oil prices. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the index climbed 2.2 percent. The recent low readings have helped reduce some of the pressure on the Fed to raise rates. That will change, though, if inflation begins to pick up.Rising rates can hurt stocks in two ways. They can push up borrowing costs for companies and consumers. That, in turn, may prompt them to spend less, which can crimp the economy. Higher rates also make the returns from bonds more attractive than stocks and cause investors to shift some of their money to bonds from stocks.Consumers fuel America\u2019s economyData releases: Retail sales, the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment surveyConsumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the American economy. It has remained strong in recent months, thanks to lower oil prices and the tax cuts enacted at the end of 2017. Retail sales, which capture consumer spending on a wide variety of purchases like cars, furniture, meals, clothing, health care products and electronics, surged in November, and the Johnson Redbook index of retail sales at department and chain stores has remained strong.The question in the new year is whether that will hold up. Market volatility that has shrunk 401(k) balances could hurt. The housing market is also showing signs of weakness, and that may dampen consumer spirits. Those factors along with the government shutdown did hit consumer confidence in January. The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index fell to slipped to its lowest level of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.A pullback in consumer purchases would have an impact far beyond the retailers, affecting companies that provide the parts and products sold online and in stores. Business spending may be slowingData releases: National Federation of Independent Business small-business optimism index, the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing and nonmanufacturing indexesBusiness spending on long-term investments like buildings, factories, equipment and technology is crucial to a strong economy. It picked up last year. Will that trend continue in the new year? Already the recent market volatility, a swing in oil prices, the trade war, and concerns about the strength of the economies in the United States and abroad appear to have caused executives to hold off on such investments. Orders for durable goods \u2014 products designed to last at least three years \u2014 weakened in second half of 2018.The National Federation of Independent Business small-business optimism index also hit a 14-month low in December, and the number of the survey\u2019s respondents expecting to expand their business declined.Another clue that things aren\u2019t as hot as they once were came from the Institute for Supply Management last month. Its indexes of purchasing managers measure activity across the manufacturing and service sectors of the United States economy. A reading above 50 means activity across the sector is expanding, while a figure below 50 indicates contraction. Both indexes are well above 50, but in December the manufacturing index posted its largest one-month drop since the last recession. The housing market isn\u2019t what it used to beData releases: Existing home sales, new home sales, pending home salesGiven the importance of housing to the United States economy \u2014 it is the biggest driver of both wealth and indebtedness for most families \u2014 its struggles have added to worries about the sustainability of the economic expansion.A combination of higher costs, mortgage rates and home prices has rippled through the housing market since last spring. Sales of new single-family homes fell for five straight months through October, the last month of data available because of the shutdown. Existing home sales, which is released by the National Association of Realtors, account for 90 percent of all home sales, and last year was the weakest year for such sales since 2015. And residential investment subtracted from economic growth in each of the first three quarters of 2018."}, {"title": "China Warnings From Caterpillar and Nvidia Hit U.S. Stocks", "category": "Business", "id": "aa0f89d9-aed3-4bfe-8fe1-38b6e075b84d", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/business/stock-market-china-profits.html", "publishdate": 20190128, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/29/business/29Markets/29Markets-articleLarge.png", "content": "Corporate warnings about China\u2019s sluggish economy hit stocks on Monday as the battle between the world\u2019s largest economies over trade and technology continued to weigh on the outlook for growth and profits.The warnings, which came from the chipmaker Nvidia and the bulldozer builder Caterpillar, concerned very different sectors of China\u2019s economy. But the message was nearly the same, as was the sharp tumble in shares, which made them the two worst performing stocks in the S&P 500. The broad index dropped almost 0.8 percent on Monday.Nvidia, which makes technology that allows computers to quickly render graphics for games, cut its expectations for revenue in the fourth quarter by roughly half a billion dollars, to $2.2 billion, sending its shares down nearly 14 percent. The Santa Clara, Calif., company cited \u201cdeteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China,\u201d for hampering demand for such graphics-processing chips.Shares of other chipmakers \u2014 which derive large chunks of their revenue from sales in China \u2014 fell in sympathy with Nvidia. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled almost 8 percent, helping to make the information technology sector one of the worst-performing parts of the S&P 500 on Monday.Meanwhile, Caterpillar, which builds bulldozers, excavators and dump trucks, was down 9 percent after the quarterly profit it reported on Monday fell short of the expectations of Wall Street analysts.The Deerfield, Ill., industrial giant also undershot analyst expectations for its full-year profit forecast. The company said it now expected construction equipment sales in China \u2014 somewhere between 10 percent and 15 percent of all of the companies\u2019 construction sales \u2014 to be flat in 2019.The health of the Chinese economy, which is the world\u2019s second largest, has emerged as a key risk to the American stock market in 2019. Last year China grew at its slowest pace in 28 years, as it continues shift away from the model that drove the country\u2019s economic rise in recent decades, focusing on industrial exports. It has pushed toward a model that relies more on consumer spending.That transition has been made even more difficult by the eruption of a tariff war with the United States under President Trump. Originally that fight was centered on cutting China\u2019s longstanding trade surplus with the United States, but has more recently expanded to tough-to-resolve issues around determining technological dominance, which would be even more difficult to solve anytime soon.The re-emergence of investor concerns around China have helped cool what was a sizzling start to the year for the American stock market. Through the first three weeks of the year, the S&P was up 6.5 percent, the index\u2019s best start since 1987.

Madoff, arguably the most notorious financial criminal of all time, was arrested for defrauding investors in a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, he was released on $10 million in bail the same day. Until his trial months later, he lived and slept  in his Manhattan penthouse.Carlos Ghosn, the global auto chieftain indicted on charges of financial wrongdoing in Japan, can only imagine such freedom. Last week, a Tokyo court denied his lawyers\u2019 bail request for the second time in a single week. He remains consigned to a small cell inside the hulking gray jail where he has been since his arrest in November.Mr. Ghosn, 64, who until recently helmed a global car-making empire that united Nissan and Mitsubishi of Japan and Renault of France, has been indicted on charges that he underreported his income by more than $80 million for years and temporarily transferred personal investment losses to Nissan while he was chairman and chief executive.His lawyers have said Mr. Ghosn, who denies all allegations, could remain in custody for months. In the most recent court decision, he was denied bail even after he promised to surrender his passports, rent an apartment in Tokyo and pay personally for an ankle bracelet and private security guards.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s predicament has turned a laser focus on the Japanese criminal justice system. Westerners \u2014 and particularly foreign businesses \u2014 are incredulous over the power that prosecutors have wielded. The lawyers can detain defendants for more than three weeks before bringing charges, arrest suspects multiple times to extend their detention and interrogate them without their counsel.\u201cThat is exactly what Kafka was writing about in his novels about dystopian societies,\u201d said Phil Telfeyan, executive director of Equal Justice Under Law, an American advocacy group. \u201cThat is really far beyond what we would expect from a society that offers due process rights.\u201dIn an open letter to the Japanese authorities published in the daily Le Monde last week, a group of 50 French lawyers rallied behind Mr. Ghosn. As the head of Renault, Mr. Ghosn was responsible for a car company that employs tens of thousands of workers. The lawyers bluntly accused Tokyo prosecutors of trying to obtain \u201cforced confessions.\u201d By keeping Mr. Ghosn in jail for two months, they said, prosecutors were trying to \u201cweaken his defenses.\u201dAnother French daily, Liberation, ran an editorial headlined: \u201cThis is not how it should work in a healthy society!\u201d This weekend, President Emmanuel Macron of France told reporters that he had expressed concern to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan about the \u201cvery long\u201d and \u201charsh\u201d conditions of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s detention.In the Diplomat, an online magazine published in Tokyo, Brad Adams, Asia director for the advocacy group Human Rights Watch, criticized Japan for the practice of questioning defendants without their lawyers and of extending detentions, week after week. \u201cThis is an approach to the rights of accused people that one would expect in a dictatorship, not in Japan,\u201d he wrote.ImageBernard J. Madoff after a hearing in 2009. His case shows a contrast between the American and Japanese justice systems, especially when it comes to wealthy or high-profile defendants.CreditMichael Appleton for The New York TimesFormer detainees have described jail conditions in Japan, where they are locked in cells of about 160 square feet, with tatami mats on the floor and toilets in the corner. They are allowed 30 minutes of exercise, three days a week, and eat meals with rice and miso soup. When Mr. Ghosn appeared in court \u2014 to ask for an explanation of why he was being held as well as to declare his innocence \u2014 the once robust executive was sallow-cheeked and thin.Mr. Ghosn resigned from Renault after the court\u2019s latest refusal to grant bail. Renault had said it has seen no evidence of financial misconduct by Mr. Ghosn, but the carmaker was eager to resolve weeks of strained relations with Nissan and Mitsubishi.Mr. Ghosn signed the letter of resignation, ending a nearly 20-year career, from his jail cell.The bail decision has spurred outrage. In an interview, Mr. Adams noted that Japan is a signatory to a United Nations treaty that states in criminal proceedings \u201cit shall not be the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in custody.\u201dAbout a quarter of defendants in Japan were released on bail before trial in 2015, according to the latest data from the Japan Federation of Bar Associations. Among those who assert their innocence, the bail rate fell; one in about 13 defendants was granted bail.Legal experts say prosecutors rely on a clause in Japan\u2019s Constitution that permits courts to deny bail if they deem suspects at risk to tamper with evidence. A defendant who claims innocence is \u201calmost automatically deemed a defendant of some probable cause to hamper evidence,\u201d said Takashi Takano, a criminal defense lawyer in Tokyo.When Mr. Ghosn appeared in court, the judge told the millionaire that he was being held because he was a flight risk and might conceal evidence. (Greg Kelly, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s close aide and a Nissan board director who has faced accusations in the same inquiry, was freed on bail on Christmas Day.)In the United States, suspects who are not charged within 48 hours must be released. \u201cFrom the moment you are arrested you are given a bail amount,\u201d Mr. Telfeyan said. \u201cAnd if you can afford it, you are free within moments of your arrest.\u201dA notable exception in the United States \u2014 and a criticism \u2014 is that there is an income disparity in its justice system. The Madoff arrest in 2008 is an example: Wealthy defendants have the means to avoid detention. Low-income defendants often face a fate similar to Mr. Ghosn\u2019s. According to data from the Prison Policy Initiative, last year about 536,000 people sat in jail on any given day in the United States, simply because they could not afford bail.And in France, where suspects are generally held in jail for a maximum of two days after being charged, suspects \u2014 particularly foreigners \u2014 can be kept in custody if judges rule there is a risk they could flee the country. In some cases, people have been detained up to 12 months.Japanese critics of their country\u2019s justice system say prosecutors want bail to be denied so they can wear down defendants. They are, for all practical purposes, seeking confessions. Close to 90 percent of suspects who are indicted do confess, according to Bar Association data. If they confess, they are more likely to be granted bail.ImageUntil recently, Mr. Ghosn helmed a global car-making empire comprising Nissan and Mitsubishi of Japan and Renault of France.CreditGonzalo Fuentes/Reuters\u201cIf you deny the charges, you will be detained for a very long time,\u201d Mr. Takano said. \u201cThis message is very clear.\u201d He said some defense lawyers advised clients to confess simply to \u201cget it over with.\u201dJapanese courts tend to interpret the notion of evidence tampering broadly. In Mr. Ghosn\u2019s case, experts said the court might have been concerned that, once free, he could pressure former subordinates.\u201cThe court still considers him a person of great influence\u201d who could pull strings at Nissan, said Yasuyuki Takai, a prosecutor turned defense lawyer who advised Takafumi Horie, an internet tycoon who was found guilty of violating securities laws a decade ago.On Monday, Nissan confirmed that it had received an inquiry, after the arrest of Mr. Ghosn, from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nissan would not elaborate but said it was cooperating fully. Nissan was indicted by Tokyo prosecutors for its role in Mr. Ghosn\u2019s financial filings.Speaking to reporters last week, Shin Kukimoto, deputy chief prosecutor at the Tokyo District Prosecutors\u2019 Office, declined to give much rationale for Mr. Ghosn\u2019s detention; he said Japanese courts did not usually employ ankle bracelets for bailed defendants.Some people who have been detained in Japan have reported surreal interrogations.Atsuko Muraki, a former top welfare ministry bureaucrat who was arrested for postal fraud and exonerated after a key witness retracted his testimony, spent five months in detention in 2009. In her memoir, she said a prosecutor had repeatedly tried to make her sign a statement with false quotes attributed to her.\u201cI never said that, so I cannot sign this,\u201d Ms. Muraki recollected. The prosecutor told her that such fabrications were typical and that \u201cthere may be some exaggerations.\u201dThe logic behind denying counsel is simple, as one judge described it. Prosecutors \u201cdo not want to be in the same room with a suspect\u2019s lawyer because that is the prosecutor\u2019s enemy,\u201d said Hiroshi Segi, a former Tokyo District Court judge. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to conduct their business while their enemy is present.\u201dMr. Ghosn\u2019s wife has appealed to Human Rights Watch to petition the Japanese government for his release. The advocacy group has demurred, pointing out that the Ghosn case should \u201cmake Japanese lawmakers rethink their system\u201d but that his case is not an outlier.Poor suspects without access to media or high-priced lawyers suffer the same treatment, said Mr. Adams of Human Rights Watch. \u201cOf course we are concerned about his rights,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019re really concerned about the people unknown and never to be known.\u201d"}, {"title": "As 2020 Looms, the News Media Looks Forward, and Back", "category": "Business", "id": "cf5fb3fc-d466-4fb8-807c-9576ef972f0f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/business/media/2020-elections-media.html", "publishdate": 20190128, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/28/business/28jpelection-media1-print/merlin_149757663_f4d99ff3-1196-46a6-b9ab-f931c95c951e-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "As Americans brace for the next presidential campaign \u2014 already underway and showing on a screen near you \u2014 press pundits are worried about the news media\u2019s readiness for the challenge ahead.Will reporters follow the same assumptions that made the outcome in 2016 such a shock? Can pollsters reassure a public that has soured on the power of political forecasting?To answer those questions, I turned to a cohort accustomed to diagnosing human foibles: scholars who have expertise in psychology. After all, journalists are basically a bunch of neurotics. And with the 2020 race looming, maybe we could all use some time on the couch.\u201cAll of us who thought it was inevitable that Trump would lose ignored warning signs that we were wrong,\u201d said Susan Fiske, a professor of social psychology at Princeton.It turns out that human beings \u2014 and I\u2019m including journalists in that group \u2014 have a tendency to discount the possibility of events that have not occurred before.\u201cThere\u2019s an old joke \u2014 \u2018Dear Diary, the 100 Years War started today,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Fiske, who has consulted for political candidates eager for insight into the average voter\u2019s mind.Her point being: Hindsight may be 20/20, but when it comes to predicting 2020, we may as well be Mr. Magoo. If reporters, pundits, bureau chiefs and cable news producers are able to live with uncertainty about future events, rather than clinging to any fixed ideas about the campaign\u2019s outcome, they will be less likely to make regrettable decisions about what their coverage emphasizes and what it plays down.Noah Oppenheim, who became president of NBC News in 2017, said that when news channels aired footage of Mr. Trump\u2019s early campaign rallies, which featured his anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim remarks, some producers based in New York and Washington figured voters would be turned off.Instead, Mr. Oppenheim said in an interview, \u201cA lot of people listened to it, and it resonated.\u201dEven after Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee, and thousands flocked to his rallies, many journalists and voters seemed unable to imagine that he could succeed in a general election.\u201cIt\u2019s not that journalists missed the signs of Trump\u2019s rise; it\u2019s that journalists and the rest of us were not well equipped to understand the future,\u201d said Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a professor of risk management who popularized the term \u201cblack swan\u201d to describe how experts ignore the warning signs of enormous surprise events.\u201cWe are fooled chronically by the same thing over and over again,\u201d Mr. Taleb said, noting that people tend to ignore that historical aberrations \u2014 wars, catastrophes, financial crashes \u2014 were rarely anticipated at the time they occurred. \u201cYou\u2019re driving forward looking into the rearview mirror,\u201d he said.Journalists, he counseled, ought to develop a habit of questioning their assumptions. The notion of Mr. Trump\u2019s becoming president seemed deeply unlikely before 2016. So was the notion of an African-American president, before 2008.\u201cIn all situations, we look for certainties; we need therapy, to feel that we are being guided, for comfort,\u201d Mr. Taleb said. \u201cFor the next election, the best thing to say is 50/50, or 48/52. But you don\u2019t say he will win or he won\u2019t win.\u201dThe tricky thing about presidential contests is that Americans infuse a great deal of emotional energy into the outcome, which can further cloud clear thinking. That includes experts who, as they now admit, could have known better.\u201cThe conventional wisdom gave too little weight to the possibility that Trump would win,\u201d said Steven Pinker, the author and Harvard psychologist. \u201cI confess to being among those that were stunned by the outcome and probably shouldn\u2019t have been.\u201dImage\u201cIt\u2019s not that journalists missed the signs of Trump\u2019s rise; it\u2019s that journalists and the rest of us were not well equipped to understand the future,\u201d said Nassim Nicholas Taleb, center, a professor of risk management.CreditRebecca Smeyne for The New York TimesMr. Pinker, who urges students to accept that data is almost always more reliable than intuition, followed the polls that showed Mr. Trump at the top of the Republican field. On Election Day, he understood intellectually that a 30 percent chance of winning meant that if the election were held 10 times, Mr. Trump would prevail in three of them. Yet he still could not bring himself to contemplate that Mr. Trump might win.\u201cWe tend to play out movies in our mind\u2019s eye,\u201d Mr. Pinker said, \u201cand indeed are overly influenced by them.\u201dThat is grist for media pollsters and the news consumers who treat them like oracles. How about the political journalists on the ground, whose job it is to gauge the mood of the electorate and monitor the competition in real time?After the personality-driven race of 2016, there were calls for a renewed focus on policy. In this view, the news media should stop playing up the day-to-day gaffes and campaign tactics in favor of emphasizing serious issues like the candidates\u2019 positions on climate change, the minimum wage and European trade.It\u2019s a noble goal, and news organizations in 2016 produced plenty of deeply reported work on such matters. Ms. Fiske, though, said that elections were fundamentally about voters sizing up their faith in an individual, a decision rooted more in emotion than logic.\u201cThe whole country says, \u2018Who is this person, and what do they stand for?\u2019\u201d Ms. Fiske said. \u201cI can tell you there are only two dimensions, really. One is, \u2018Are they trustworthy, are they on my side?\u2019 And the other is, \u2018Can they do stuff? Are they competent?\u2019\u201dIn an ideal world, elections would focus on policy, Ms. Fiske said. \u201cBut you can defend the regular person who is saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know what issues are going to come up in the next four years.\u2019\u201dO.K., so the theorists have weighed in. How about the practitioners?In interviews, top political producers at major TV networks said that a main goal for the coming race was to keep viewers informed, while tempering their expectations.\u201cOur interpretation of the polls is what we need to work on in 2020,\u201d said Sam Feist, CNN\u2019s Washington bureau chief. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on us as political journalists to remind our audiences that a two-point race could very well be tied.\u201dCherie Grzech, the vice president of the Fox News Washington bureau who oversees the network\u2019s campaign reporting, agreed. \u201cThe news cycle is so quick that I think polling will face even a bigger challenge this time around; people\u2019s viewpoints change so quickly,\u201d she said. Still, Ms. Grzech added, \u201cWe know there\u2019s great polarization in the country. Some people are going to vote one way or the other, no matter what happens.\u201dCNN faced criticism in 2016 for broadcasting hours of Trump rallies, once showing footage of an empty Trump lectern even as Hillary Clinton spoke elsewhere. Many networks allowed Mr. Trump to phone in live to answer questions, lured by the direct access to a candidate and the ratings that came with it.In the election\u2019s aftermath, Jeff Zucker, CNN\u2019s president, issued a mea culpa. Anchors and network executives, though, noted that Mrs. Clinton rejected many of their requests for on-air appearances. Mr. Feist, in an interview, defended CNN\u2019s coverage and said that, \u201cWe simply have to make a news judgment each time, and weigh all of the factors as news editors.\u201d\u201cThe first three letters of the word news are \u2018new,\u2019\u201d Mr. Feist added. \u201cIf a candidate or a newsmaker is able to join you by phone and has something newsworthy to say, that\u2019s an option for us, depending on the moment.\u201dMr. Oppenheim, of NBC News, noted that journalists ought to contextualize the news, not censor it.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the obligation of a cable channel to shield its audience from something it might disagree with,\u201d Mr. Oppenheim said. \u201cIf you watched the programming around those rallies, you would have heard harsh, aggressive criticism of what was being said.\u201dMr. Trump is still attacking journalists\u2019 credibility, and many voters remain concerned about the way 2016 was covered. Mr. Oppenheim acknowledged that the next 21 months would be crucial for trust in the news media as an institution.\u201cI see every minute of every day as a test for the national media,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are under intense scrutiny, and appropriately so. It\u2019s never been more imperative that we get the facts right in our reporting. We know if we slip up, the consequences are going to be significant.\u201d"}, {"title": "A Tiny Screw Shows Why iPhones Won\u2019t Be \u2018Assembled in U.S.A.\u2019", "category": "Business", "id": "adf25681-7156-4edd-a84f-e86643900676", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/technology/iphones-apple-china-made.html", "publishdate": 20190128, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/02/business/02apple05/29apple05-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Despite a trade war between the United States and China and past admonishments from President Trump \u201cto start building their damn computers and things in this country,\u201d Apple is unlikely to bring its manufacturing closer to home.A tiny screw illustrates why.In 2012, Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, went on prime-time television to announce that Apple would make a Mac computer in the United States. It would be the first Apple product in years to be manufactured by American workers, and the top-of-the-line Mac Pro would come with an unusual inscription: \u201cAssembled in USA.\u201dBut when Apple began making the $3,000 computer in Austin, Tex., it struggled to find enough screws, according to three people who worked on the project and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.In China, Apple relied on factories that can produce vast quantities of custom screws on short notice. In Texas, where they say everything is bigger, it turned out the screw suppliers were not.[Apple disabled the iPhone\u2019s Group FaceTime feature to fix a bug that made eavesdropping possible.]Tests of new versions of the computer were hamstrung because a 20-employee machine shop that Apple\u2019s manufacturing contractor was relying on could produce at most 1,000 screws a day.The screw shortage was one of several problems that postponed sales of the computer for months, the people who worked on the project said. By the time the computer was ready for mass production, Apple had ordered screws from China.The challenges in Texas illustrate problems that Apple would face if it tried to move a significant amount of manufacturing out of China. Apple has found that no country \u2014 and certainly not the United States \u2014 can match China\u2019s combination of scale, skills, infrastructure and cost.ImageTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, helped lead the company\u2019s shift to foreign manufacturing in 2004.CreditErica Yoon for The New York Times[Apple computers were once made in Silicon Valley. It did not go well.]  In China, you will also find one of Apple\u2019s most important markets, and over the last month the risks that come with that dependence have become apparent. On Jan. 2, Apple said it would miss earnings expectations for the first time in 16 years, mostly because of slowing iPhone sales in China. On Tuesday, the company is expected to reveal more details about its financial results for the most recent quarter and its forecast for the coming year.The company could face more financial pressure if the Trump administration places tariffs on phones made in China \u2014 something the president has threatened to do.Apple has intensified a search for ways to diversify its supply chain, but that hunt has homed in on India and Vietnam, according to an Apple executive who asked not to be named because the executive was not authorized to speak publicly. The company\u2019s executives are increasingly worried that its heavy dependence on China for manufacturing is risky amid the country\u2019s rising political tensions with the United States and unpredictability, this person said.\u201cThe skill here is just incredible,\u201d Mr. Cook said at a conference in China in late 2017. Making Apple products requires state-of-the-art machines and lots of people who know how to run them, he said.\u201cIn the U.S., you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I\u2019m not sure we could fill the room,\u201d he said. \u201cIn China, you could fill multiple football fields.\u201dKristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, said the company was \u201can engine of economic growth in the United States\u201d that spent $60 billion last year with 9,000 American suppliers, helping to support 450,000 jobs. Apple\u2019s Texas manufacturer, Flextronics, did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Cook helped lead Apple\u2019s shift to foreign manufacturing in 2004, a move that cut costs and provided the enormous scale necessary to produce some of history\u2019s best-selling tech products.Apple contracted much of the work to enormous factories in China, some stretching miles and employing hundreds of thousands of people who assemble, test and package Apple products. That assembly includes parts made around the world \u2014 from Norway to the Philippines to Pocatello, Idaho \u2014 that are shipped to China.ImageThe final assembly is the most labor-intensive part of building the iPhone, and its location often determines a product\u2019s country of origin for tariffs.CreditKarly Domb Sadof/Associated PressThe final assembly is the most labor-intensive part of building the iPhone, and its location often determines a product\u2019s country of origin for tariffs.Mr. Cook often bristles at the notion that iPhones are Chinese-made. Apple points out that Corning, at a factory in Kentucky, makes many iPhone screens and that a company in Allen, Tex., makes laser technology for the iPhones\u2019 facial-recognition system.Mr. Cook has also disputed that cheap labor is the reason Apple is still in China. But it doesn\u2019t hurt. The minimum wage in Zhengzhou, China, home of the world\u2019s biggest iPhone factory, is roughly $2.10 an hour, including benefits. Apple said the starting pay for workers assembling its products there was about $3.15 an hour. Compensation for similar jobs in the United States is significantly higher.While it was one of Apple\u2019s most powerful computers, the American-made Mac Pro also turned out to be one of its most expensive.Chinese suppliers shipped their components to Texas. But in some cases, the Texas team needed new parts as designs changed, and engineers who were tasked with designing the computer found themselves calling machine shops in central Texas.That is how they found Stephen Melo, the owner and president of Caldwell Manufacturing in Lockhart. Employees of Flextronics, the company hired by Apple to build the computers, in turn hired Caldwell to make 28,000 screws \u2014 though they would have liked more.When Mr. Melo bought Caldwell in 2002, it was capable of the high-volume production Apple needed. But demand for that had dried up as manufacturing moved to China. He said he had replaced the old stamping presses that could mass-produce screws with machines designed for more precise, specialized jobs.Mr. Melo thought it was ironic that Apple, a leader in offshore manufacturing, had come calling with a big order. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to invest for that in the U.S. because that stuff is purchased very cheaply overseas,\u201d he said.ImageWorkers heading to a Foxconn factory dedicated to iPhones in Zhengzhou, China, in 2015. Such factories can employ hundreds of thousands of people who assemble, test and package Apple products.CreditGilles Sabrie for The New York TimesHe made do with his new machines, although he could not make the exact screws Apple wanted. His company delivered 28,000 screws over 22 trips. Mr. Melo often made the one-hour drive himself in his Lexus sedan.A former Apple manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the Flextronics team had also been far smaller than what he typically found on similar Apple projects in China. It was unclear exactly why the project was understaffed, the manager said, speculating that it was because American workers were more expensive.The manager said similar Apple jobs in China would include a roomful of people working to ensure that all materials were in place for production. In Texas, it was one worker, who often seemed overwhelmed, the manager said. As a result, materials were regularly out of place or late, contributing to delays.Another frustration with manufacturing in Texas: American workers won\u2019t work around the clock. Chinese factories have shifts working at all hours, if necessary, and workers are sometimes even roused from their sleep to meet production goals. That was not an option in Texas.\u201cChina is not just cheap. It\u2019s a place where, because it\u2019s an authoritarian government, you can marshal 100,000 people to work all night for you,\u201d said Susan Helper, an economics professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland and the former chief economist at the Commerce Department. \u201cThat has become an essential part of the product-rollout strategy.\u201dMs. Helper said Apple could make more products in the United States if it invested significant time and money and relied more on robotics and specialized engineers instead of large numbers of low-wage line workers. She said government and industry would also need to improve job training and promote the development of a supply-chain infrastructure.But, she added, there is a low chance of all that happening.Apple still assembles Mac Pros at the factory on the outskirts of Austin, in part because it has already invested in complicated and custom machines. But the Mac Pro has been a slow seller, and Apple has not updated it since its introduction in 2013.In December, Apple announced that it would add up to 15,000 workers in Austin, just miles from the Mac Pro plant. None of the new jobs are expected to be in manufacturing."}, {"title": "On Politics: Did the Shutdown Hurt Trump\u2019s 2020 Chances?", "category": "Politics", "id": "d9f76757-8dae-485a-b9ad-59ca9d0026dc", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/politics/shutdown-trump-2020.html", "publishdate": 20190128, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Monday morning.

The decision comes more than four years after Tesco started a price-cuts campaign and revamped stores to win back customers.Tesco shares closed down 1.73 percent on Monday.Retailers in Britain have been under pressure for months. Consumer spending on food rose slightly over Christmas, but retail sales over all were flat. It was the worst December in 10 years for retailers and a sign of a tough year ahead given uncertainty over Brexit, according to the British Retail Consortium.Tesco still accounts for the largest share of sales at supermarkets, but it is facing increasing competition from discount stores like Aldi and Lidl and online shopping.The supermarket industry has also been preoccupied with the possibility that Britain will crash out of the European Union without an agreement on its separation, an event that could disrupt the supply of food, about of a third of which comes from the European Union. Growth in the supermarket sector has also slowed.Dave Lewis, Tesco Group\u2019s chief executive, wrote in the company\u2019s 2018 annual report that \u201cconsumers are feeling the impact of economic uncertainty.\u201dThe chief executives of several Tesco competitors on Monday signed an open letter warning that a no-deal Brexit could put pressure on food supplies. Tesco executives did not sign the letter, but its annual report noted that leaving the European Union could increase import costs, drive up inflation and affect its ability to recruit.\u201cIn our four years of turnaround we\u2019ve made good progress, but the market is challenging and we need to continually adapt to remain competitive and respond to how customers want to shop,\u201d Jason Tarry, Tesco\u2019s chief executive for Britain and Ireland, said in a statement on Monday.The company also said it would close deli counters at about 90 stores. Employees in Tesco\u2019s head offices will also be affected.Tesco made a similar announcement about simplifying operations last January, eliminating jobs such as \u201cpeople manager\u201d and \u201ccompliance manager.\u201d That move affected 1,700 people. The company pledged in 2016 that it would reduce its costs by 1.5 billion pounds, or about $1.7 billion, by the fiscal year ending in 2020.Pauline Foulkes, the national officer at the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, said workers were devastated by the news. \u201cStaff at Tesco are shocked and dismayed by the scale of yet another round of potential job losses, which clearly demonstrates the pressure retailers are under in the current very difficult and uncertain economic climate,\u201d Ms. Foulkes said in a statement."}, {"title": "Please Send Us Your College Application Essays About Money", "category": "Business", "id": "87e6e603-08c0-418b-b9db-a4a9542bbeb2", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/your-money/college-application-essay.html", "publishdate": 20190128, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/25/business/00essays/00essays-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Did you apply for undergraduate admission this year and write an application essay about money, work, social class or other related topics?

Sign up here.Huawei and China\u2019s role in 5GThe next generation of computer and phone networks, known as 5G, is expected to connect cities around the world and fuel a future run on robots, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and other technologies.But it may also rely on an infrastructure vulnerable to hackers and spies, one that the U.S. wants to stop China from building.The Trump administration has conducted a campaign to pressure allies such as Britain, Poland and Germany to banish Chinese companies, especially the telecommunications giant Huawei, from participating in the 5G buildup, according to the NYT:The administration contends that the world is engaged in a new arms race \u2014 one that involves technology, rather than conventional weaponry, but poses just as much danger to America\u2019s national security. In an age when the most powerful weapons, short of nuclear arms, are cyber-controlled, whichever country dominates 5G will gain an economic, intelligence and military edge for much of this century.What\u2019s next? President Trump is expected to issue an executive order prohibiting American companies from incorporating equipment originating from China in critical telecommunications networks, extending current rules that apply only to government entities. His administration, which has also waged a trade war with China, says that it is motivated by concern for national security, not just by competitive defensiveness. China\u2019s economic czar, Liu He, will meet with the American trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, in Washington on Wednesday for two days of trade talks, which is likely to cover issues of cyberprotection and the proliferation of state-owned companies.What do officials think? Beijing\u2019s ambassador to the E.U. threatened \u201cserious consequences\u201d if Huawei and other Chinese companies were excluded from 5G projects. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired the country\u2019s ambassador to China after he said that a senior Huawei executive had \u201cstrong arguments\u201d to fight extradition to the U.S.And businesses? Tech manufacturers are diversifying outside China as trade tensions fester and the country\u2019s economy slows. Foxconn and Pegatron, two Taiwanese companies that assemble iPhones, are expanding production capacity in India and Vietnam. American industrial companies with exposure to China have said that their sales there are weakening. But Apple is unlikely to bring production closer to the U.S., where manufacturers struggle to \u201cmatch China\u2019s combination of scale, skills, infrastructure and cost,\u201d according to the NYT.____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Promotions at elite law firm stir diversity debateThe law firm Paul, Weiss is more diverse at its top ranks than most of its peers. But after the announcement of its new partner class, people across the industry began to comment that all of the faces were white, and that only one was a woman\u2019s, the NYT\u2019s Noam Scheiber and John Eligon write.Paul, Weiss has said that it regretted the \u201cgender and racial imbalance\u201d of its 2019 class. But the episode underscores how big law firms are still falling short when it comes to elevating women and people of color.Mr. Scheiber and Mr. Eligon interviewed more than 20 women and people of color who described obstacles to achieving diversity at Paul, Weiss. Many said that opportunities to be groomed for partner were harder to come by for women and minorities.\u201cI fear that African-American partners in big law are becoming an endangered species,\u201d said Theodore Wells, a black partner at Paul, Weiss and one of the country\u2019s most prominent litigators.ImageHoward Schultz in New York in 2016.CreditAndrew Kelly/ReutersHoward Schultz lays groundwork for presidential bidThe former chief executive of Starbucks told Andrew yesterday that he was preparing to run for president in 2020 as an independent.Denouncing the \u201cbroken political system,\u201d Mr. Schultz said he had already begun the groundwork to get on the ballot in all 50 states.Long-shot bid: Despite his considerable wealth, Mr. Schultz would face a difficult road. Few independent candidates have mounted significant challenges for the White House.Political jabs: In an interview with \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Mr. Schultz said Donald Trump was \u201cnot qualified to be the president\u201d and that lawmakers from both parties were engaged in \u201crevenge politics.\u201dSwift response: The announcement was condemned by top Democratic operatives, who said they were worried that Mr. Schultz would split votes in a general election.As Lyft\u2019s I.P.O. nears, pressure grows on its C.E.O.Logan Green, the chief executive of Lyft, is known to be reserved, usually letting his second-in-command speak for their ride-sharing service. But now, he\u2019s in a race with Uber to take the companies public, write the NYT\u2019s Mike Isaac and Kate Conger.That means Mr. Green may have to give up some up his reserve and step into a more public role.The back story: Both Lyft and Uber have filed regulatory papers to list their shares on the stock market in the coming months. The offerings are likely to create a bonanza in Silicon Valley.Why it matters: Lyft, which was last privately valued at $15.1 billion, is tiny compared with its rival and could be overshadowed if Uber debuts first. Uber could go public at a $120 billion valuation.Markets await earnings, Fed guidance and the jobs reportStocks sank at the end of last year on fears of an imminent recession, but those concerns have largely abated, with global markets now rallying at the fastest pace in months. But investors are still cautious ahead of a busy week.The next few days bring an onslaught of quarterly earnings reports from the likes of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Tesla \u2014 many of which are considered to be representative of the broader economy. The Federal Reserve is also holding policy meetings this week, which come after central banks in Europe and Japan sounded cautious notes. And on Friday, the monthly U.S. jobs report will be released.The world economy \u201cis not in crisis,\u201d writes Neil Irwin. But, he adds:What the last few months have made clear is that the forces that have held back the global economy for the last 11 years are not temporary, and have not gone away. And that, in turn, makes the world uncommonly vulnerable to a bout of bad luck or bad policy.The work force is still aging. Productivity growth remains weak, as is consumer demand. Low interest rates could constrain central bankers trying to engineer an escape from a downturn. And a \u201cnasty feedback loop\u201d could result in more political dysfunction, leading to risks of economic disruption like the type posed by the recent government shutdown.Speaking of which: After a 35-day stalemate, the government is open again, much to the chagrin of some of President Trump\u2019s conservative supporters. The 116th Congress will consider Democratic wage proposals in the house and a Middle East policy bill in the Senate. Lawmakers may also consider whether to ban future shutdowns entirely.

While it has had some success with new products like the Apple Watch, the company has not found another product with the global impact of the iPhone, which was introduced more than a decade ago. Apple is also uniquely vulnerable to slowing consumer demand in China, as well as potential tariffs on Chinese-made products.Apple\u2019s stock price is down a third since its peak last summer, and now it is worth less than several of its longtime rivals in the tech industry.Apple could face more financial pressure if the Trump administration places tariffs on phones made in China \u2014 something President Trump has threatened to do. The bulk of Apple\u2019s products are made in Chinese factories.There are also new concerns about a security flaw in the iPhone. On Monday, Apple customers said an iPhone user could call someone else who had an iPhone and listen in on that person\u2019s conversations through the device\u2019s microphone \u2014 even if the recipient did not answer the call. The problem was the result of a bug involving Apple\u2019s FaceTime app. The company promised to have a fix by the end of the week.Apple\u2019s total revenue for the quarter was $84.3 billion, a 5 percent drop from a year earlier and in line with the revised forecast earlier this month.Sales of iPhones, following a global trend for smartphones, have been leveling off for several years. Their revenue was $51.98 billion, a 15 percent drop from a year earlier. It\u2019s harder now to offer more specifics on iPhone sales because Apple recently stopped disclosing how many units it sells each quarter.Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview that sales had slumped largely because current iPhone owners were waiting longer to upgrade their devices, a trend that has continued into the current quarter. He blamed fewer subsidies from wireless carriers, a strengthening United States dollar and cheaper battery upgrades that consumers have used to extend the lives of their old phones.Apple has attributed some of its issues in China to a trade war with the United States. And there is concern that some Chinese customers are shying away from Apple products out of national pride, particularly since the authorities in the United States brought charges against the Chinese telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. Prosecutors cited a decade-long attempt to steal trade secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade economic sanctions on Iran.\u201cWe did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said this month.But some data suggest Apple faces more fundamental problems with its business in China. Chinese consumers appear to be opting for less expensive but similar smartphones from Chinese makers, particularly Huawei. Some of Apple\u2019s latest phones top $1,000, far above the typical cost for its Chinese competitors.Total sales in the region that includes China were down 25 percent in the fourth quarter to $13.17 billion. Outside China, revenues increased slightly.\u201cWe\u2019ve actually seen the economic situation in China continue to deteriorate over the course of the quarter,\u201d Mr. Maestri said. \u201cFrom mid-November onwards, we\u2019ve seen a deceleration of economic activity in China.\u201dBut he added that Apple had recovered some business by cutting prices in China for the iPhone XR, the lowest-priced new iPhone, to offset the strengthening dollar. Apple declined to disclose the exact size of the price cut.Mr. Cook said in a call with financial analysts that he believed the iPhone\u2019s high price had hurt sales in emerging markets, and that Apple had dropped prices in a number of them.Apple made up for tepid iPhone sales in the quarter with 19 percent revenue growth in other areas. The wearables category, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, led the way with a 33 percent increase to $7.3 billion.Apple\u2019s earnings per share were $4.18 in the quarter, beating analysts\u2019 expectations by a penny. Apple\u2019s overall profit was down 0.5 percent to $19.97 billion.Apple\u2019s struggles appear to be continuing. The company said it expected between $55 billion and $59 billion in revenue in the current quarter, below analysts\u2019 expectations for $59 billion.Apple\u2019s share price was up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading after its results were announced on Tuesday."}, {"title": "In Taiwan, an Invitation to a \u2018Living Room\u2019 for Culture", "category": "Business", "id": "128195b9-608c-45dc-af78-ed36db569e8c", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/business/in-taiwan-an-invitation-to-a-living-room-for-culture.html", "publishdate": 20190129, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/business/30TAIWAN-01/merlin_148551780_eaf47fe6-5204-4b9d-9f01-7629eccd5e91-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan \u2014 The National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts in Taiwan stands out for its colossal presence and undulating design.Some people here say it looks like a spaceship. Others think it resembles a giant stingray.One point is not contested, however. With a look inspired by banyan trees and the local shipping industry, the arts center has raised the cultural prestige of this southern Taiwanese city while providing residents with a popular public space.The performing arts center, known as Weiwuying after its surrounding park, is the world\u2019s largest under one roof. The $348 million facility opened last October with indoor and outdoor concerts, signaling its arrival as a new destination for world-class performances in Kaohsiung, long derided by Taiwanese as being a \u201ccultural desert.\u201dImageOutside the National Kaohsiung Center for the Arts. The $348 million facility opened in October with indoor and outdoor concerts.CreditAn Rong Xu for The New York TimesThe opening capped a transition for the site, a former military base established by imperial Japan during its colonial rule of Taiwan. After World War II, it was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s Kuomintang. Today, the 1.5-million-square-foot arts center sits at the north end of Weiwuying Municipal Park, which opened in 2010 and is roughly one-seventh the size of Central Park.Visitors to Kaohsiung might mistakenly think the arts center has long been a part of life here because of the way residents have so openly embraced it. In the morning, people practice yoga on mats while others jog through Banyan Plaza, the building\u2019s covered square, which connects the four halls: a 2,236-seat opera house, a 1,981-seat concert hall, a 1,210-seat playhouse and a 434-seat recital hall.Films are shown in the plaza, and free public activities such as dance classes and martial arts lessons for children are held there. Inside the building, residents have access to free exhibitions; the current one highlights the evolution of Taiwanese opera. With an Instagram-friendly exterior and interior, selfie-takers are ubiquitous.ImageThe arts center at Weiwuying had 800,000 visitors in its first nine weeks after opening.CreditAn Rong Xu for The New York Times\u201cThe building invites you to use it, acting as an extension of the park and the city,\u201d said Francine Houben, the building\u2019s designer and creative director at the Dutch architecture firm Mecanoo. \u201cI like to call it the living room of Kaohsiung.\u201dAttendance has averaged above 80 percent for the first season of performances at the art center. Many performances, including the December opening of the opera house featuring Taiwan\u2019s world-renowned dance troupe Cloud Gate, have sold out quickly.For the arts center\u2019s grand opening in October, several thousand people attended a special performance at a terrace where the canopy-like roof slopes to the ground, creating an amphitheater. It has become a popular place for residents to sit and watch the sunset.On the day of the grand opening, Taiwan\u2019s president, Tsai Ing-wen, spoke at the building\u2019s dedication, lauding it as an example of \u201cspatial democratization\u201d in Taiwan, which liberalized its political system in the 1990s after four decades of martial law.\u201cThe establishment of an arts center at this venue symbolizes the removal of martial law and our efforts to promote greater cultural accessibility,\u201d Ms. Tsai told a packed concert hall.Unsurprisingly, the area around the Weiwuying arts center has become a rising star of the city\u2019s property market. Property prices around the park and arts center have risen by 15 to 20 percent in the past two years, said Alex Kuo, director of a nearby office of Yung-Ching Realty.ImageChien Wen-pin, the arts center\u2019s executive and artistic director. \u201cWe want artists to come and feel and create for themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to push artists to create new work.\u201dCreditAn Rong Xu for The New York Times\u201cWhen construction of the Weiwuying arts center was completed, high-end residential developments began to arrive in the area,\u201d Mr. Kuo said. \u201cWhere older apartments typically sold for around $3,000 per square foot, newer developments were now commanding prices upward of $9,000 per square foot.\u201dThe new luxury apartment buildings beginning to pop up nearby contrast with the Weiwuying arts center\u2019s working-class aesthetic. Ms. Houben and her team at Mecanoo initially struggled to find the right exterior for the massive arts facility, but eventually found inspiration in the city\u2019s maritime identity \u2014 two decades ago it was the world\u2019s third-busiest port.\u201cWe tried several options without success,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continued our search for the building\u2019s skin and the idea arose to use the finely tuned, locally accessible techniques of Kaohsiung\u2019s shipbuilding industry.\u201dImageThe building\u2019s covered square connects four halls: a 2,236-seat opera house, a 1,981-seat concert hall, a 1,210-seat playhouse and a 434-seat recital hall.CreditAn Rong Xu for The New York TimesSelling the idea of making a modern, multimillion-dollar cultural center that had an exterior similar to a container ship rather than something sleek like glass and steel took some work. Its modern design reflects Taiwan\u2019s steady move away from Chinese-style design after democratization, a sign of the shift of identity here from Chinese to Taiwanese.\u201cWe had to convince everyone that the Banyan Plaza should have the detailing of a cargo ship and not of a luxury yacht,\u201d Ms. Houben said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to aim for a perfect smooth facade. We wanted to employ the ship builders to do what they do best \u2014 create a durable, long-lasting skin on a scale that some contractors would be intimidated by.\u201dThe building\u2019s four performance halls were designed to accommodate world-class performers such as the London Philharmonic Orchestra, which will play here in March. In April, Deutsche Oper am Rhein will perform Puccini\u2019s \u201cTurandot.\u201dImageOutside the arts center. \u201cThe building invites you to use it, acting as an extension of the park and the city,\u201d said Francine Houben, the building\u2019s designer.CreditAn Rong Xu for The New York TimesMecanoo brought a theater consultant on board to make sure sufficient thought was given to both form and function. The acoustics of the concert hall, Taiwan\u2019s first with 360-degree seating, make performances in the large space feel deceptively intimate. For instance, the recital hall\u2019s asymmetric design facilitates viewing of the pianist\u2019s hands.\u201cThe design principle that Francine brought to Weiwuying was to get people close to the arts, and close to each other,\u201d said Chien Wen-pin, the arts center\u2019s executive and artistic director, a position he took after serving as director of Deutsche Oper am Rhein in D\u00fcsseldorf for 22 years. A native of Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital in the north, he was persuaded to return to Taiwan in 2013 by the island\u2019s culture minister, Lung Ying-tai.Mr. Chien praised the versatility of the stages and performance spaces in the arts center\u2019s four halls, which he said he hoped would enable performers to re-envision their art.\u201cWe want artists to come and feel and create for themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to push artists to create new work.\u201dThe arts center at Weiwuying appears to be off to a strong start: It had 800,000 visitors in its first nine weeks after opening, and larger performances have drawn audience members from Taiwan\u2019s northern cities as well as farther afield, including Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.It also seems to be well received by those who do not take particular interest in the arts. Chen Hsiao-li, a Kaohsiung resident who runs a small shop selling betel nuts and cold drinks near Weiwuying, said she thought the arts center would help revitalize the neighborhood.\u201cI\u2019m not really the theatergoing type, but my daughter is, so it\u2019s nice that she has somewhere she can go for that,\u201d Ms. Chen said. \u201cFor the rest of us, I think it will bring more people into Kaohsiung and bring more business to this part of the city.\u201d"}, {"title": "Recent Commercial Real Estate Transactions", "category": "Business", "id": "980e397c-83a6-4f29-82b5-aed3f359eba4", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/realestate/commercial/new-york-real-estate.html", "publishdate": 20190129, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/realestate/commercial/30tranForSale/30tranForSale--articleLarge.jpg", "content": "FOR SALE$8.8 MILLION64 West 85th Street (between Columbus Avenue and Central Park West)ManhattanThis 19-foot-wide 1889 Renaissance Revival-style townhouse, designed by Gilbert A.

Want this by email? Sign up here.U.S. charges Huawei with theft and sanctions evasionThe Justice Department partly unsealed a pair of indictments yesterday that accuse the Chinese telecommunications firm of trying to steal trade secrets, evade economic sanctions on Iran and obstruct a criminal investigation into its behavior.The context: The charges come as officials from Beijing and Washington prepare to continue trade negotiations and as the Trump administration tries to shoulder Huawei out of international efforts to build the next generation of wireless networks, known as 5G. The company has denied the claims; a spokesman for China\u2019s industry and information technology ministry called them \u201cunfair and immoral.\u201dThe allegations: The U.S. says that Meng Wanzhou, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, participated in a plot to defraud four large banks into clearing millions of dollars in transactions with Iran in violation of international sanctions. American officials say that Huawei tried to impede their investigation by destroying evidence and by moving employees out of the U.S. to prevent them from being called as witnesses. The company, prosecutors say, also stole information about a phone-testing robot called Tappy from T-Mobile facilities in Washington state and encouraged employees to steal other confidential information from competitors.What now: Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, said that the U.S. government wants to have Ms. Meng extradited from Canada, where she was detained last year at Washington\u2019s request and where officials are now on tricky political turf trying to balance American and Chinese interests. The tussle has the industry on edge; an internal assessment from Deutsche Telekom concluded that the 5G rollout in Europe would be delayed by at least two years and cost billions of euros if governments banned Huawei, whose technology underpins much of the current network infrastructure.____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Throwing a wrench into trade talks with ChinaThe Huawei charges will complicate negotiations on Wednesday that were already expected to be tense.A delegation of dozens of Chinese representatives led by Vice Premier Liu He will meet near the White House with a group headed by Robert Lighthizer, President Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary. On Thursday, Mr. Liu is expected to meet with Mr. Trump.Mr. Mnuchin said there had been \u201csignificant movement\u201d on talks that involved \u201cvery complicated issues,\u201d including intellectual property protections and questions of enforcement. The Chinese may offer to increase their purchases of U.S. farm products and energy, and slightly change their industrial policies, while pushing back on demands to eliminate subsidies to favored industries.The parties have until early March to reach an agreement, or else risk an escalation in the trade conflict.Mr. Trump is being pressured by the markets and the corporate sector to deliver a deal. A recent survey found that his trade policies had led more than a third of American manufacturers to raise prices. Yesterday, the chip maker Nvidia and the bulldozer builder Caterpillar both issued warnings about business conditions in China.As Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China division, notes:\u201cThe damaging economic effects of the shutdown and Trump\u2019s desire to score a cleaner win at least on trade could also make U.S. negotiators somewhat more flexible and willing to strike a deal.\u201dImageA section of border wall being built in the U.S. near Tijuana, Mexico.CreditScott Olson/Getty ImagesThe aftershocks of the shutdownThe five weeks when much of the government was out of commission cost the U.S. economy $11 billion, nearly a quarter of it permanently lost, the Congressional Budget Office said yesterday.That\u2019s nearly double the $5.7 billion President Trump is seeking for a southern border wall \u2014 a project he still wants and is still threatening to shut down the government to get.The damage will be mitigated somewhat as furloughed workers start to receive their back pay, but with the government only funded for three weeks, many federal employees plan to hold off on spending.Here\u2019s another wrinkle: Government statisticians just now returning to work are behind on collecting and analyzing figures on retail sales, manufacturing data, housing statistics and other information. Investors, executives and analysts nervous about signs of weakness in the economy are grasping for details about the labor market, inflation and business spending. And when the Federal Reserve\u2019s policymaking group meets starting today, it will be missing some of its customary guides.Howard Schultz defends his plan to run as an independentHoward Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, told Andrew yesterday that he was not fazed by criticism that his potential presidential bid as an independent could strengthen President Trump\u2019s chances for re-election.\u201cNobody wants to see Donald Trump removed from office more than me,\u201d Mr. Schultz said at an event in a Barnes & Noble bookstore in New York to kick off his national book tour.Responding to critics: Mr. Trump said in an early morning tweet that Mr. Schultz did not have the \u201cguts\u201d to run, a taunt that Mr. Schultz called \u201cchildish.\u201d Michael Bloomberg, another possible presidential contender, condemned independent bids.Hecklers in the crowd: \u201cDon\u2019t help elect Trump,\u201d yelled one protester, who was escorted out of the event in New York. Mr. Schultz was interrupted a second time by a man who chanted, \u201cHealth care is a human right.\u201dMore: Bill Burton, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, pushed back against criticism over his decision to join Mr. Schultz\u2019s team. And the harsh response on social media to a potential Schultz candidacy could affect the Starbucks brand, according to the Washington Post.Ghosn\u2019s plight reveals a pattern in JapanCarlos Ghosn, the global auto chief indicted on charges of financial wrongdoing, remains consigned to a small cell after a Tokyo court again denied his bail request. His predicament has turned a spotlight on the Japanese criminal justice system, writes the NYT\u2019s Motoko Rich:The lawyers can detain defendants for more than three weeks before bringing charges, arrest suspects multiple times to extend their detention and interrogate them without their counsel.Some in the West have reacted strongly to the power that prosecutors have wielded. \u201cThis is an approach to the rights of accused people that one would expect in a dictatorship, not in Japan,\u201d one critic wrote.Revolving DoorBlackBerry named Bryan Palma, a senior vice president at Cisco, as its chief operating officer and president.

Bloomberg, a possible rival of hers for the Democratic presidential nomination, said the proposal would \u201cbankrupt us for a very long time.\u201dMr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who is considering a 2020 bid on a centrist Democratic platform, rejected the idea of \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d which has been gaining traction among Democrats.\u201cI think you could never afford that. You\u2019re talking about trillions of dollars,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg said during a political swing in New Hampshire, which holds the nation\u2019s first primary in 2020.\u201cI think you can have \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 for people that are uncovered,\u201d he added, \u201cbut to replace the entire private system where companies provide health care for their employees would bankrupt us for a very long time.\u201dMr. Bloomberg did not mention any of his would-be competitors by name. But his wording \u2014 particularly the distinction he drew between providing Medicare to everyone and providing it only to those currently uninsured \u2014 positioned him clearly against Senator Harris.Few Democrats have explicitly suggested ending private insurance, even though many have endorsed \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Ms. Harris initially stopped short of it, too, saying at a CNN town-hall event on Monday that she supported \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and adding, \u201cWe have to appreciate and understand that access to health care, it should not be thought of as a privilege. It should be understood to be a right.\u201dBut when the CNN anchor Jake Tapper pressed her on what that meant for private insurance, Ms. Harris responded, \u201cLet\u2019s eliminate all of that.\u201dLily Adams, a spokeswoman for Ms. Harris, responded to Mr. Bloomberg on Twitter, noting that he is a billionaire.On Tuesday night, a campaign spokesman for Ms. Harris said she still supports and prefers the elimination of private insurers, but also noted that she had previously backed other bills that are alternates to \u201cMedicare for all\u201d that would preserve some role for the insurance industry. A Harris spokeswoman also emphasized on Twitter that this comment did not mean Ms. Harris was bending on \u201cMedicare for all.\u201dBut the campaign\u2019s move to modify Ms. Harris\u2019s comments on such a major issue illustrated the difficulty the 2020 hopefuls could face attempting to appeal to their progressive base while not turning off general election voters.The disagreement between Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Harris reflects a basic divide within the Democratic Party. On one side are liberals who have proposed ambitious left-wing policies, from \u201cMedicare for all\u201d to a wealth tax on the richest Americans. On the other side are centrist and fiscally conservative Democrats, along with liberals who support such policies in theory but argue that voters would reject them."}, {"title": "Who Wins and Who Loses From PG&E\u2019s Bankruptcy", "category": "Business", "id": "205cac63-90b3-46c1-b9b2-c50ce71f61db", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/business/dealbook/pge-bankruptcy-winners-losers.html", "publishdate": 20190129, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/business/30electric01/merlin_149161881_8e65a8d3-0d4f-4744-b98a-543451584e96-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "This could get messy.Facing tens of billions of dollars in wildfire liabilities, Pacific Gas and Electric on Tuesday filed for bankruptcy protection, a step that the company has said was its \u201conly viable option.\u201d But some PG&E investors, elected leaders in its home state of California and public interest groups contend that bankruptcy is not needed and will hurt millions of ratepayers and anybody who owns shares in the utility or does business with it.That fundamental disagreement about the company\u2019s financial health is one of the main reasons the utility\u2019s bankruptcy case could drag on for months. The filing will create uncertainty for the company\u2019s creditors and people who have lost homes and loved ones to fires that were started by PG&E\u2019s equipment and are seeking compensation from the company. The case could also cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, to Wall Street and white-shoe law firms.PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy could have consequences far beyond its immediate winners and losers. The bankruptcy could shape California\u2019s response to climate change and the threat of catastrophic wildfires. Why did PG&E file for bankruptcy protection?At first glance, PG&E appears to be solvent. At the end of September, the company\u2019s assets exceeded its debt by about $20 billion. What is at dispute is just how much the company owes for starting wildfires in 2017 and 2018. The utility says it could be on the hook for $30 billion. But right now, investors seem to be betting that PG&E can go through bankruptcy, meet wildfire claims and still have money left over for shareholders. That is why PG&E\u2019s stock price closed up more than 16 percent on Tuesday afternoon, giving the company a market value of more than $7 billion. Bankrupt companies typically have a negligible market value.And investors may be optimistic because they believe PG&E will end up paying substantially less than $30 billion in wildfire claims. One reason for that outlook is that the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection concluded last week that PG&E equipment was not at fault for the Tubbs Fire, which killed 22 people and destroyed over 5,600 buildings. Had it been found responsible, the company could have been liable for $8 billion in damages.Bankruptcy could also help ease the financial pressure on PG&E. By delaying some payments, and taking on new loans, the company hopes to avoid running low on cash and not being able to afford improvements that reduce the risk of future fires. That is because loans a company takes on while it is in bankruptcy court are typically paid before the company\u2019s other obligations.Read more about PG&E\u2019s bankruptcyPG&E\u2019s Bankruptcy Filing Creates \u2018a Real Mess\u2019 for Rival InterestsJan. 29, 2019PG&E Is Cleared in Deadly Tubbs Fire of 2017Jan. 24, 2019PG&E Bankruptcy Tests Who Will Pay for California WildfiresJan. 14, 2019PG&E Bankruptcy Could Deal Blow to Its Solar-Power Suppliers\u2019 FinancesJan. 17, 2019Who might get trampled in a bankruptcy?Estimating wildfire costs is tricky, and PG&E\u2019s liabilities could end up being larger than investors expect. In that case, the stock could get wiped out. Creditors and wildfire claimants would then be at risk of not getting all that they are owed.That risk was highlighted last week in federal court in a separate case. In that case, PG&E is under probation after the utility was convicted of felonies stemming from a 2010 gas explosion in San Bruno near San Francisco. Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court, who is overseeing the utility\u2019s probation, has said he wants PG&E to eliminate the risk that the utility\u2019s equipment would start wildfires. In a court filing last week, PG&E said complying with the judge\u2019s proposal could cost up to $150 billion.But even if the utility appears to have enough money to meet all debts and liability claims, some people or businesses could be hurt. To keep its operations going, PG&E is expected to make payments to some contractors and vendors before others. And contracts that were reached at prices that are well above today\u2019s prevailing rates could be revised down in bankruptcy. ImageThe Camp Fire destroyed the town of Paradise, Calif. State investigators have not yet determined what caused that fire or whether PG&E;'s equipment was responsible.CreditTalia Herman for The New York TimesSeveral contracts PG&E has signed with solar power suppliers might be vulnerable to such revisions. One supplier, NextEra, has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees wholesale power contracts, to intervene if PG&E tries to reject contracts. PG&E on Tuesday asked the bankruptcy court to assert that it has exclusive jurisdiction over such contracts.Wildfire victims might have to wait longer than they had anticipated for their claims to be paid. A case involving the utility stemming from the so-called North Bay fires of 2017 is scheduled to go to trial in September in San Francisco County Superior Court. Resolution of that case could be delayed because it might now also have to win the approval of the federal bankruptcy court, a lawyer for plaintiffs in that case said.\u201cThe reality is that there\u2019s a ton of needless work that\u2019s going to get done,\u201d the lawyer, Michael Kelly, said.Who\u2019s going to make money from PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy?Bankruptcy cases involving big corporations usually produce hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for lawyers, bankers and consultants. BlueMountain Capital Management, which owns PG&E stock and opposes the company\u2019s bankruptcy, says PG&E\u2019s last bankruptcy, filed in 2001, cost more than $400 million in fees. The current case could cost a lot more because lawyers\u2019 hourly rates have gone up a lot since then.The 2014 bankruptcy filing of Energy Future Holdings, a Texas utility, yielded professional fees of more than $600 million, according to data collected by Texas Lawbook. Still, some legal experts say that processing many claims in one court can save money. \u201cIt\u2019s going to produce some pretty big efficiencies,\u201d said Lynn M. LoPucki, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.PG&E has also asked the bankruptcy court to approve roughly $130 million of 2018 bonus payments to employees, who stand to get $5,000 to $90,000 each. The $130 million figure does not include the bonuses for 12 senior PG&E executives. The company has not yet asked the court to approve payments to those executives, although it noted that senior officers are typically eligible to receive bonuses in bankruptcy. What can California do to get lasting benefits out the bankruptcy?It depends on what steps elected leaders take. PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy highlights the flaws in how the state pays for catastrophic wildfires. Even after bankruptcy, PG&E may not be strong enough to prevent and meet the cost of future fires. As a result, many investors might be reluctant to lend to the company or might only do so at high interest rates.The California Legislature could seek to expand the scope of legislation it passed last year that allowed utilities to pass on some of the costs of wildfires to its customers in the form of higher electricity rates. But voters would consider that a bailout of PG&E. An idea outlined in a bill introduced this month by Chad Mayes, a Republican assemblyman, offers a different approach. He is proposing to create an industry-financed insurance fund that pays for catastrophic wildfire costs. Such a fund might reassure investors that bankruptcy is no longer the most likely option when a utility is hit with huge damage claims, and it may also satisfy residents who oppose legislation that is too favorable to utilities. California needs to take bold steps to avoid another utility bankruptcy, said Severin Borenstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThe potential for catastrophic loss and liability is going to be here, and as long as it\u2019s here, you\u2019re going to need some sort of process for sorting it out that\u2019s not bankruptcy.\u201d"}, {"title": "PG&E\u2019s Bankruptcy Filing Creates \u2018a Real Mess\u2019 for Rival Interests", "category": "Business", "id": "781795c9-3580-4aa2-9829-335af25014ee", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/business/energy-environment/pge-file-bankruptcy.html", "publishdate": 20190129, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/29/business/29utility02/merlin_149655927_1f1ad7a7-fc24-4091-b1c1-2cb43dfcba34-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Pacific Gas and Electric\u2019s bankruptcy filing on Tuesday, to deal with billions of dollars in wildfire liability, set off a scramble by the company, investors and elected leaders in California to protect themselves and influence what happens next.The corporate reorganization is shaping up to be one of the most complicated and difficult in recent years. In addition to traditional legal tussles between the company and its creditors and suppliers, the bankruptcy court will contend with demands by California officials and victims to force PG&E to pay damage claims estimated at tens of billions of dollars for wildfires started by its equipment. State leaders and residents are also likely to seek to thwart any effort by the utility to raise electricity rates.Coming up with a bankruptcy plan for PG&E, which is California\u2019s largest utility and serves 16 million people, will amount to solving an intricate puzzle. Proposals to raise rates to pay creditors will inflame residents and lawmakers. And seeking to reduce what the utility pays for solar power could hurt renewable-energy companies and jeopardize California\u2019s climate-change goals.\u201cThis is a real mess,\u201d said Dan Reicher, an assistant energy secretary in the Clinton administration. \u201cIt comes down to lots of needs: Take care of the fire victims, keep the lights on, ensure progress on climate change and protect ratepayers. That\u2019s at least a partial list.\u201dEven before the company made its filing in United States Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, various groups were sniping at one another. Shareholders accused the company of rushing into bankruptcy. And consumer groups said the State Legislature was bailing out utilities by letting PG&E and other companies raise electricity rates, already among the highest in the country, to pay for some wildfire liabilities.PG&E said this month that bankruptcy was its \u201conly viable option.\u201d In its filing, the company said it had $51.7 billion in debt and $71.4 billion in assets as of Sept. 30. Its liabilities will most likely be revised up significantly as state investigators establish the cause of deadly wildfires in the last two months of 2018.This is the utility\u2019s second bankruptcy in less than 20 years. It sought bankruptcy protection in 2001 after a botched state deregulation of the electricity industry.Investors and state officials tried to persuade the company\u2019s board to change its bankruptcy plans in recent days by offering alternatives. Some of them hoped a state finding last week that PG&E did not cause the Tubbs Fire, which tore through Sonoma County in 2017 and was the second-worst fire in California history, had reduced the utility\u2019s liabilities enough to make bankruptcy unnecessary.But PG&E still faces liability claims for 17 of 21 major wildfires in 2017. And its equipment is under investigation in several 2018 wildfires, including the Camp Fire, which killed at least 86 people and destroyed thousands of properties.By the start of this week, many investors and state officials appeared resigned to the company\u2019s filing. The California Public Utilities Commission held an emergency meeting Monday to approve PG&E\u2019s plan to borrow $5.5 billion to finance itself over the next two years while it is in bankruptcy.California\u2019s lawmakers thought they had taken care of PG&E\u2019s wildfire liabilities last year when they passed legislation that allows the utility to raise rates to pay damage claims from the 2017 wildfires. After the November fires, lawmakers were considering expanding that legislation to cover 2018.But they abandoned that proposal two weeks ago when the utility announced that it would seek bankruptcy protection.Assemblyman Chris Holden, chairman of the Utilities and Energy Committee, said Tuesday that he was drafting a bill to direct the California Public Utilities Commission to press PG&E to fully compensate wildfire victims. The legislation would also direct the commission to resist efforts by the utility to raise electricity rates. Mr. Holden, a Democrat from Pasadena, said he hoped it would pass before the company submitted its restructuring plan in court.Assemblyman Marc Levine, a Democrat from Northern California, said the Legislature ought to revise or revoke parts of the 2018 law, a step that could increase losses for PG&E\u2019s creditors and suppliers.\u201cIn the longer run, the Legislature and the administration have an obligation to ensure that the company\u2019s ratepayers and fire victims are prioritized over shareholders,\u201d Mr. Levine said.Lawmakers who have long been critical of PG&E, including State Senator Jerry Hill, a Democrat from San Francisco, are pushing for even farther-reaching changes. Some of them want PG&E\u2019s gas and electric divisions separated or would like to break up the utility into smaller businesses with a smaller geographic footprint.\u201cPG&E\u2019s bankruptcy filing is just another example of them looking out for their own interests,\u201d Mr. Hill said.The utilities commission is also considering proposals that would break up PG&E or turn it into a government-run operation.But those ideas would face stiff opposition, not least from International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245, a union that represents 12,000 PG&E employees.\u201cParceling out the utility into smaller, weaker segments would unquestionably have a negative impact on the safety and stability of both gas and electric service, it would increase costs, and it would decelerate progress toward California\u2019s ambitious clean energy goals,\u201d Tom Dalzell, the union\u2019s business manager, said in a statement.The company said it was committed to improving its safety record.\u201cTo be clear, we have heard the calls for change, and we are determined to take action throughout this process to build the energy system our customers want and deserve,\u201d John R. Simon, interim chief executive of PG&E Corporation, said in a statement. He declined an interview request on Tuesday.Balancing the interests of residents, wildfire victims, labor unions and the company rests largely on the shoulders of Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who has been in office for less than a month.Mr. Newsom has, so far, offered few concrete proposals or ideas for how to reform PG&E and reduce the risk of wildfires.\u201cMy administration will continue working to ensure that Californians have access to safe, reliable and affordable service; that victims and employees are treated fairly; and that California continues to make forward progress on our climate change goals,\u201d Mr. Newsom said in a statement on Tuesday.The new governor is under growing pressure from residents and investors to act.At a hearing before the utilities commission on Monday, residents held signs that read \u201cNo PG&E Bailout\u201d and shouted, \u201cStop this now!\u201dBlueMountain Capital Management, one of PG&E\u2019s major investors, said the bankruptcy filing was \u201creckless and irresponsible\u201d and called for replacing the company\u2019s board of directors.\u201cToday\u2019s filing is the latest example of how the board continues to fail the company, wildfire victims, customers, employees, creditors, shareholders and the people of California,\u201d the firm said in the statement. \u201cWe urge all stakeholders to support change at PG&E and will be proposing a new slate of highly qualified and impartial directors.\u201dMr. Reicher, the former energy official, said local, state and federal government officials needed to work together to come up with plans to address the problems at PG&E and to prevent wildfires this year.\u201cThis is a real unfortunate civics lesson in a situation like this,\u201d said Mr. Reicher, a research fellow at the Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance at Stanford. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much at stake.\u201d"}, {"title": "Huawei and China, Facing U.S. Charges, Have Few Ways to Retaliate", "category": "Business", "id": "c0f5a7ce-2e2f-407d-aed8-a77d587dc10a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/technology/huawei-indictment-criminal-charges.html", "publishdate": 20190129, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/world/30huawei-1/merlin_149914233_0fead824-a2ff-44cd-9182-1ee3bdd92360-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SHANGHAI \u2014 Ever since Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer at the Chinese technology giant Huawei, was arrested in Canada nearly two months ago, Chinese officials have denounced the move as \u201cwrongful\u201d and \u201carbitrary\u201d \u2014 a political affair cloaked in a judicial one.Now that the United States has laid out its case against Ms. Meng in greater detail, neither Huawei nor the Chinese government has easy options for responding or retaliating.Huawei, the world\u2019s largest provider of the equipment that powers mobile phone and data networks, said on Tuesday that it was innocent of charges unveiled in Washington the day before that it had misled the United States government about its business in Iran, obstructed a criminal investigation and stolen American industrial secrets.China\u2019s Foreign Ministry called again for the United States and Canada to release Ms. Meng, who is a daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder and chief executive, Ren Zhengfei.But should Ms. Meng be extradited to the United States to face charges, as American officials say they plan to request before a deadline on Wednesday, Beijing will have few ways to force Washington\u2019s hand.China is in the middle of a trade war that it is eager to end as its vast economy slows. Any effort to get tough on the United States \u2014 such as by detaining American nationals, as it did to Canadians after Ms. Meng was arrested \u2014 could scuttle the negotiations.Those talks are set to resume on Wednesday, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a television interview on Tuesday that the case against Ms. Meng would not affect them.\u201cForced technology issues are part of trade discussions,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, while emphasizing that any issues related \u201cto violation of U.S. law or U.S. sanctions are going through a separate track, which is the Justice Department.\u201dHuawei\u2019s Washington operations have undergone drastic turnover as it appears to rein in its sales ambitions in America and shift tactics in its relations with the government. In the second shake-up of its American leadership in less than a year, the company is replacing Regent Zhang, its head of government affairs in Washington, with Joy Tan, currently its head of global communications.ImageMeng Wanzhou, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, in Vancouver, British Columbia, in December. China and Huawei alike have few easy options if she is extradited to the United States.CreditDarryl Dyck/The Canadian Press, via Associated PressThe broad language of the Justice Department\u2019s indictments suggests that other Huawei leaders, including Mr. Ren, a former officer in the People\u2019s Liberation Army, might wish to exercise caution while traveling to countries that have an extradition treaty with the United States.\u201cIf I was his lawyer, I would advise him to be careful,\u201d said Julian Ku, a professor of law at Hofstra University.But that kind of caution could make it harder still for Huawei to hold on to its business in places like Europe. Already, the United States has been applying pressure on all sides against Huawei, fearing that the Chinese government could use the company\u2019s gear to sabotage other countries\u2019 communication networks.Previously, Canadian officials had said Ms. Meng was accused of tricking financial institutions into making transactions that violated United States sanctions on Iran. One of the two indictments unsealed on Monday outlines a broader effort.The indictment says Huawei\u2019s misrepresentations to the United States government and four multinational financial institutions began in 2007. It cites an interview between agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Mr. Ren around July of that year, in which Mr. Ren said that his company complied with all American laws and that it had not dealt directly with any Iranian company.The indictment also cites 2012 testimony before the United States Congress in which a Huawei executive said the company\u2019s business in Iran had not violated sanctions. That executive was Charles Ding, a corporate senior vice president. Mr. Ding, who was not mentioned by name in Monday\u2019s indictment, could not be reached for comment.Also in the indictment is a reference to a file found on an electronic device that Ms. Meng was carrying when she arrived at Kennedy International Airport in New York in 2014. Officials detained her for a couple of hours when she arrived, according to a person with knowledge of the events. During that time, they briefly confiscated her electronic devices, said the person, who asked for anonymity because the events had not been made public.The file she was carrying, which the indictment said might have been deleted before being discovered, contained \u201csuggested talking points\u201d about Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom, the company that prosecutors accuse Huawei of using as an unofficial subsidiary to obtain American-sourced goods, technology and services for its Iranian business.The indictment also said Skycom employed at least one United States citizen in Iran, a violation of American law. And it said that after Huawei found out that the United States was pursuing a criminal investigation in 2017, the company destroyed evidence and tried to move unspecified witnesses who knew about its Iranian business to China, beyond the reach of the American government.The other indictment, which concerns the theft of trade secrets from the American wireless provider T-Mobile, refers to internal emails describing a plot to steal testing equipment from T-Mobile\u2019s lab in Bellevue, Wash.Huawei has contended that its employees were acting on their own to learn more about a robot that T-Mobile used to test smartphones, nicknamed Tappy because it could rapidly tap a phone screen. But the indictment cites multiple emails exchanged between Huawei engineers urging those with access to Tappy to take increasingly precise measurements.ImageRen Zhengfei, the founder and chief executive of Huawei, is Ms. Meng\u2019s father.CreditVincent Yu/Associated PressEventually, the indictment says, a Huawei engineer sneaked into the Tappy laboratory with the help of other Huawei employees who had access. He was caught and thrown out but returned, the indictment said.Later, after all but one Huawei employee had their access to the robot revoked, the employee took a Tappy robotic arm home for closer study, according to the indictment. A Huawei investigation into the issue, which concluded there was minimal coordination among the engineers, contained false statements, the indictment said.The indictment also cites a Huawei program started in 2013 to reward employees for stealing confidential information from competitors. They were directed to post such information to an internal Huawei website, or in special cases to an encrypted email address, the indictment said. Bonuses were apportioned to those who stole the most valuable information, it said.The evidence presented in this week\u2019s indictments bolsters the American case for extraditing Ms. Meng, said Mr. Ku of Hofstra University.\u201cThe standard for extradition is whether a Canadian court would send her to trial,\u201d Mr. Ku said. \u201cEssentially, is there enough evidence to indict someone? I think this will help meet that standard.\u201dProsecutors redacted the identity of at least one of the defendants, most likely to leave open the option of arresting that person. That person isn\u2019t likely to be Mr. Ren, said Mr. Ku, because he is mentioned later in the indictment. But that doesn\u2019t guarantee prosectors won\u2019t target him later.Huawei has worked for a reset in Washington as relations with the American government have worsened. Last year it cut staff in Washington after investigations into the company deepened and AT&T walked away from a deal to sell Huawei\u2019s phones. Further personnel shifts in recent weeks appear to be focused on improving its image in America.Ms. Tan, Huawei\u2019s incoming head of government affairs in Washington, has for years played a key role in the company\u2019s media relations. She will be tasked with engaging an American administration that has grown hawkish on China. Her predecessor in Washington, Mr. Zhang, had previously been responsible for sales in Mexico.The mounting global skepticism toward Huawei and other Chinese tech suppliers is starting to have practical effects on the telecommunications industry.On Tuesday, TPG Telecom, an internet provider in Australia, said it had been forced to cancel the construction of its mobile network because of the Australian government\u2019s decision last year to forbid Huawei to supply next-generation, or 5G, equipment.In a stock-exchange filing, TPG said it had already spent around $70 million on its new network, largely on Huawei gear. But the company said it did not make sense to invest further in a network that could not later be upgraded to 5G."}, {"title": "The Post-Brexit Food Chain: \u2018This Is Really, Really Scary\u2019", "category": "Business", "id": "599d0efe-721e-4302-8947-36559ce51080", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/business/brexit-food-shortages.html", "publishdate": 20190130, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/business/31HUNGRYBREXIT-print/30HUNGRYBREXIT-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LONDON \u2014 Farmers, bakers and food producers have added their voices to warnings that Brexit could become a dinner plate issue. And they weren\u2019t mincing words: they called Brexit a catastrophe and said they were too busy preparing for it to deal with any other business issues.In a letter to Michael Gove, the secretary of state for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, trade associations said, \u201cBusiness throughout the U.K. food chain \u2014 and their trade associations \u2014 are now totally focused on working to mitigate the catastrophic impact of a no-deal Brexit.\u201d \u201cNeither we nor our members have the physical resources nor organizational bandwidth to engage with and properly respond to non-Brexit related policy consultations or initiatives at this time,\u201d they wrote on Friday. The department responded on Tuesday that it was meeting with representatives on a weekly basis. \u201cWhile we have intensified our no-deal planning, we are continuing to tackle other priority issues that matter to people, including our plans to reduce plastic waste and deliver a Green Brexit,\u201d it said an email.The food producers join executives at supermarket chains, like Walmart-owned Asda, and fast-food outlets, like McDonald\u2019s, which sounded the alarm in January, saying that they feared \u201csignificant disruption in the short term.\u201dThe message then: We\u2019ve run out of patience and we could be short on food. The message now (and bluntly said on BBC): \u201cThis is really, really scary.\u201dHere is how food and Britain\u2019s food chain could be affected. A costly trip to the grocerMark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has told lawmakers that food prices could rise from 5 to 10 percent in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The British Retail Consortium estimates about a fifth of all cheese in supermarkets is imported from the European Union \u2014 and consumers will be paying more for the extra paperwork and inspections needed to get these types of products into the country. The retailers in their letter warned that there would be \u201cinevitable pressure on food prices from higher transport costs, currency devaluation and tariffs.\u201dIan Wright, the chief executive of Britain\u2019s Food and Drink Federation, warned on Tuesday that many in the food industry could go out of business altogether.One in 10 members of his organization fear they could be put out of business, and one in four food exporters said they could be out of business within six weeks if a no-deal Brexit creates chaos at the ports, Mr. Wright told the BBC. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are taking this seriously enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now five-six weeks from the cliff edge.\u201dWilted lettuce, moldy strawberries Nearly a third of food consumed in Britain comes from the European Union, and much of it crosses the border effortlessly. The chaos created by the country crashing out could lead to a lot of salad stuck in traffic jams and extra customs checks after March 29, when Britain exits the bloc.Some 90 percent of lettuce, 80 percent of tomatoes and 70 percent of strawberries and blueberries in Britain comes from the European Union at that time of year. It cannot be stockpiled \u2014 and even if it could, storage space is running out. Retailers typically store no more than two weeks\u2019 inventory, according to their letter. \u201cFor consumers, this will reduce the availability and shelf life of many products in our stores.\u201dThe cost of food could rise significantly as tariffs push up the price of imports, the retailers said. Britain currently pays tariffs on about 10 percent of its imported food. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, it is possible that the British government may try to ease the rise in food prices by lowering tariffs on products from the European Union that are not grown in Britain. Citrus fruits, like oranges, would be candidates. This would limit some of the pressure on prices, said Dmitry Grozoubinski, a former trade negotiator at the World Trade Organization. But there 45 days left before Britain leaves the European Union \u2014 and no decision on those products has been made.ImageBritish farmers are likely to be affected by a no-deal Brexit, too, as their sheep become more expensive to export.CreditPhil Moore for The New York TimesA hard sell for farmers Tariffs imposed by the European Union would hit British farmers who rely on exports for their livelihood. For example, lamb from the United Kingdom is now sold in the European Union with no tariff. In the event of no-deal Brexit, the purchase price of a British lamb by buyers in Europe could increase by as much as 45 percent because of new tariffs. There is a quota system in place for sellers not in the bloc \u2014 a certain amount of food shipped into the European Union is free of tariffs. But qualifying for that portion is very competitive. Smaller operations, in particular, could find the paperwork challenging.So farmers who sell mostly to the European Union would have to look for new markets \u2014 in countries with free trade agreements \u2014 and customers outside the European Union. But this also would require meeting unfamiliar health standards and learning to work in a new market, as well as competing with more established competitors. A farmer selling lamb, for example, \u201cwould be trying to enter third markets where Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and others have been active for a long time and probably have the market pretty well cornered,\u201d Mr. Grozoubinski explained.  A land of (inspected) milk and honey?Poultry, products like milk and yogurt, and even honey could be delayed on their way in and out of the country by a number of new inspections. Document checks: all animal products will be subject to them as they enter Europe.Physical checks: staff at border inspection posts will take samples and check that products are safe for consumption. These checks will be applied to as much as half of these products. As a result, bottlenecks are predicted. Countries like France and the Netherlands are expanding the infrastructure, like inspection posts, necessary to conduct these checks. On the British side, the government a few weeks ago created an artificial traffic jam for trucks as part of its Brexit preparation. The effort was widely ridiculed. The squeeze may be felt acutely at the Irish border. Farmers in Northern Ireland send their fresh milk south to be pasteurized in the Republic of Ireland. \u201cThe reason they share this production across the border is for economy of scale,\u201d said Katy Hayward, a political sociologist at Queen\u2019s University Belfast. But those economies may be lost if an exit without an agreement leads to a hard border of some sort. \u201cThat entails physical infrastructure and an economic burden for the producer,\u201d Dr. Hayward said. \u201cThere\u2019s no facility for that at the moment.\u201d Prime Minister Theresa May wants to reopen negotiations with European leaders this week over the so-called Irish backstop plan, a policy to keep goods flowing across the Irish border.

He said that he had wanted to unite the three alliance partners in \u201cautonomy under one holding company.\u201d\u201cPeople translated strong leadership to dictator, to distort reality\u201d for the \u201cpurpose of getting rid of me,\u201d he said. Mr. Ghosn spoke to the Nikkei reporters for 20 minutes, and the article published on Wednesday was accompanied by an illustration. There were no photographs or audio files with the interview.Prosecutors, who have been questioning Mr. Ghosn  for more than two months, charged him with underreporting $80 million in income to the Japanese financial authorities and temporarily transferring personal losses to Nissan\u2019s books. He has spent more than 70 days in jail and been refused bail twice.Mr. Ghosn\u2019s lead lawyer in Japan, Motonari Otsuru, did not return a call seeking comment.In a court appearance this month, Mr. Ghosn said he was innocent of all charges. He also promised to surrender his passports and pay for a private apartment, security guards and an ankle bracelet in order to be released while under investigation. The court deemed the 64-year-old millionaire a flight risk.In the interview with Nikkei, which has deep ties to the business establishment in Japan, Mr. Ghosn said he had a \u201cplan to integrate\u201d Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors and had shared those plans with Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, in September.Nicholas Maxfield, a spokesman for Nissan, declined to comment about the timeline Mr. Ghosn provided.The interview was published a day before leaders of Renault and Nissan, which have been struggling to sort out their relationship in the wake of the arrest, are scheduled to meet. Mr. Saikawa and Jean-Dominique Senard, the recently appointed chairman of Renault, will hold a regular operational meeting in the Netherlands on Thursday.The alliance of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi is an industry juggernaut, accounting for more than 10 million car sales annually. The Nissan and Mitsubishi boards removed Mr. Ghosn as chairman shortly after his arrest. Mr. Ghosn resigned as chairman and chief executive of Renault last week.Since then, Nissan itself has been indicted on charges of financial misconduct by Japanese prosecutors in relation to the Ghosn case; the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States has also questioned Nissan.The Nikkei interview was notable for Mr. Ghosn\u2019s methodical attempt to address some of the big questions \u2014 and speculation \u2014 about his financial dealings with the carmaker. There have been steady leaks to the news media about his housing, personal finances and salary, and about whether he correctly reported his earnings to the financial authorities for several years.Mr. Ghosn told the Nikkei reporters that he denied accusations that he had improperly funneled $14.7 million in payments to a company run by a Saudi businessman, Khaled al-Juffali, whom he described in his court appearance this month as a \u201cpartner\u201d of Nissan\u2019s in the Persian Gulf region.Prosecutors are investigating accusations that Nissan funds were used to pay Mr. Juffali to provide collateral for Mr. Ghosn\u2019s personal paper losses of more than $16 million, incurred on foreign exchange investments after the 2008 financial crisis.In an earlier statement to the court, Mr. Ghosn said that Nissan had paid Mr. Juffali for services to Nissan in the Middle East. In the Nikkei interview, he said that \u201cthe executive in charge of the region signed\u201d off on the payment.Mr. Maxfield, the Nissan spokesman, said the company had \u201calready acknowledged severe problems with its governance as a company.\u201d He added, \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on the specifics of Nissan\u2019s internal investigation.\u201dIn the Nikkei interview, Mr. Ghosn denied accusations that he had improperly bought luxury homes through a Nissan affiliate, and said Nissan had approved the purchases.\u201cHari Nada has done all this,\u201d he said, referring to a senior vice president of Nissan. Mr. Nada did not answer a call seeking comment.Mr. Ghosn described as a \u201cdistortion of reality\u201d reports that he had improperly received a payment of 7.8 million euros, about $8.9 million, from a Dutch-based joint venture between Nissan and Mitsubishi. He said the venture had been set up for \u201csynergy and not for payment.\u201dMr. Maxfield of Nissan agreed with the stated purpose of the venture.\u201cThat is the point of the company,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why Nissan and Mitsubishi, in their joint investigation into conduct at that company, found misconduct by Mr. Ghosn in paying himself from that, and will be seeking to recover the full amount paid to him.\u201dMr. Ghosn\u2019s interview corresponds with statements from members of his family who have said they believe Mr. Saikawa orchestrated a coup against him.In an interview with the French business daily Les \u00c9chos this month, Mr. Saikawa dismissed reports that Nissan had organized a plot to oust Mr. Ghosn as \u201cabsurd,\u201d and contrary to the \u201cserious\u201d evidence that he said the company had gathered.Mr. Saikawa told Les \u00c9chos that Nissan\u2019s internal investigation into possible financial misconduct by Mr. Ghosn and his close associate, Greg Kelly, a board member, \u201csuggests that we are dealing with deliberate manipulation and concealment.\u201dA lawyer for Mr. Kelly, a former human resources executive and close confidant of Mr. Ghosn, has said Mr. Nada lured the executive to Tokyo in November so that prosecutors could arrest him with his boss. Mr. Kelly is American and had flown from his home in Nashville in a company jet arranged by Mr. Nada, his family said.Mr. Kelly has been charged with conspiring to underreport Mr. Ghosn\u2019s income but was released on bail in December to have surgery in Tokyo.Corporate governance experts have questioned how Mr. Ghosn could have acted on his own and without knowledge of other board directors. The Nikkei interview does not fully address that.\u201cHe refers to approvals by various parties, but not one of them is on the board of directors,\u201d said Nicholas Benes of the Board Director Training Institute of Japan, a nonprofit group that focuses on corporate governance.\u201cThis is strange, and begs to be explained,\u201d Mr. Benes said. \u201cI would like to know what each other director knew, and when did they know it.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: Hoping to Bridge the Gap in Trade Talks", "category": "Business", "id": "dfc81165-201b-4fa9-81de-89dbc6a119fe", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/business/dealbook/us-china-trade-talks.html", "publishdate": 20190130, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/business/31db-China/merlin_80199817_18a716f9-df92-4c6e-a172-3973c74e2799-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Wednesday morning.

Evidence is mounting that reciprocal tariffs are hurting both sides, and global markets have been skittish while awaiting a deal.But there are signs that China is unwilling to bend on key U.S. demands involving intellectual property and technology transfer, even as its lawmakers accelerated a vote on legislation addressing foreign investors\u2019 concerns.A pair of indictments revealed earlier this week against the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei could complicate the discussions, as could disagreements over strategy within the Trump administration\u2019s team.Other factors include:Weakness in the Chinese economy. At least 20 companies reported yesterday that their 2018 earnings would fall short of expectations. The Chongqing Changan Automobile Company, Ford Motor\u2019s primary partner in China, warned of a profit slump  of as much as 93 percent last year. China Life Insurance said its net income may have fallen as much as 70 percent. And Chinese exporters suffered a sluggish start to 2019.Slowing Chinese investment abroad. Net purchases of U.S. commercial real estate by Chinese companies \u2014 big buyers earlier in the decade \u2014 have slipped to their lowest level since 2012.Worries to the west. The motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson said that tariffs \u2014 along with other shifts in its business \u2014 left it barely breaking even in the final quarter of 2018. In the European Union, there are concerns whatever happens: If China and the U.S. reach a deal, Mr. Trump might turn his attention to German cars and French wines. If not, China might dump discounted goods into the European market. \u201cWe are next in the queue,\u201d said William De Vijlder, the chief economist at BNP Paribas.____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Diverging views on the economyThe Trump administration\u2019s growth forecast is much rosier than those of economists at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere, who warn that growth is slowing and put some of the blame on the government, writes the NYT\u2019s Jim Tankersley.President Trump\u2019s team has predicted that inflation-adjusted growth will average 3 percent through 2024. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said Mr. Trump\u2019s tax and trade policies were working as expected:\u201cLast year looked just like we thought, so we don\u2019t think, going into our next forecast, that there\u2019s a heck of a lot of reason to change our mind about things.\u201dAn exceptional year: Growth appears to have exceeded 3 percent in 2018, the first time it has done so in a decade. But many economists attribute that to a burst of fiscal stimulus that isn\u2019t expected to be repeated.Growing consensus: The Congressional Budget Office predicted that growth would slow to 2.3 percent this year and then to 1.7 percent in 2020. Economists at the Fed also forecast 2.3 percent growth this year. Some corporate financial executives are bracing for a recession.More Fed news: Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, has taken a conversational tone in public comments, but the markets didn\u2019t understand.

Lawyers, bankers and consultants are likely to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.This is PG&E\u2019s second bankruptcy in less than 20 years; the first came after California tried to deregulate utilities. Dan Reicher, who was an assistant energy secretary in the Clinton administration, called it \u201ca real mess,\u201d adding:\u201cIt comes down to lots of needs: Take care of the fire victims, keep the lights on, ensure progress on climate change and protect ratepayers.

Fewer varieties of Maybelline cosmetics will be available, and Amazon\u2019s own Echo smart speakers will vanish entirely.In all, more than 400,000 items that account for nearly a third of Amazon\u2019s estimated $6 billion in annual sales in India will probably disappear at least temporarily from the local version of the company\u2019s service, as Amazon tries to comply with new e-commerce rules imposed by the Indian government.Amazon, which had structured its operations carefully to adhere to  a 2016 revision to the country\u2019s e-commerce rules, said it had asked the Indian government to clarify the new policy and give it an additional four months to comply. \u201cWe remain committed to be compliant to all local laws, rules and regulations,\u201d Amazon said in a statement.Barring a last-minute reprieve, Amazon\u2019s leading rival in India, Flipkart, which effectively became a Walmart subsidiary last year, will also be forced to remove thousands of products from its service, particularly in the apparel category, where it sells many clothing items made by affiliated companies. Flipkart could lose as much as a quarter of its sales in the short term, according to Technopak, an Indian consulting firm.A spokesman for Walmart, which spent $16 billion for its controlling stake in Flipkart, declined to comment on the new policy or its potential effects.The change underscores the risks American companies face in India, which ranked No. 77 globally in the World Bank\u2019s most recent survey on ease of doing business.With 1.3 billion residents, the country would appear to be an attractive market. But it poses many challenges, including bad roads, low per-capita incomes, a cacophony of languages, and a consumer economy that runs largely on cash.The country\u2019s millions of shopkeepers and small traders wield tremendous power in votes and campaign donations. And its large corporations, many of them closely tied to the government, are eager to wrest Indian consumers from the embrace of foreign companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google.Prime Minister Narendra Modi traveled to Silicon Valley in 2015 to urge tech companies to invest in India.But with national elections looming in May and growing disenchantment with Mr. Modi\u2019s policies, his government has recently championed a vigorous economic nationalism, passing or proposing policies to rein in the power of foreign financial firms like Visa and Mastercard and tech companies like Facebook and Google.Just after Christmas, it was the retailers\u2019 turn. Mr. Modi\u2019s administration announced that, effective Feb. 1, foreign-owned e-commerce services like Amazon and Flipkart could not sell goods through affiliated companies. Direct sales to consumers had been banned earlier, but each of the two companies had set up a complex array of related companies to indirectly offer popular products at low prices with fast delivery.To continue operating, Amazon and Walmart will now have to turn their sites in India into digital bazaars for independent merchants, becoming more like eBay, which charges for certain services but sells nothing itself.\u201cPeople have started to buy China\u2019s viewpoint: We need to build domestic assets and domestic companies,\u201d said Ankur Bisen, an analyst who leads the retail division at Technopak. \u201cWe have to have a more nuanced approach to the onslaught of global corporations.\u201dAshwani Mahajan, a leader of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an economic self-reliance organization affiliated with Mr. Modi\u2019s political party, praised the new policy, saying it was essential to help small shopkeepers survive against the economic might of global companies that can afford to offer deep discounts.\u201cI know my next-door shopkeeper,\u201d Mr. Mahajan said, echoing arguments heard in the United States when Walmart was battling Main Street retailers. \u201cI know his family. I don\u2019t know who is Amazon, who is Flipkart. For the survival of these two entities, I can\u2019t put the livelihood of my country at risk.\u201dSnapdeal, an Indian online marketplace that was hurt by earlier price wars with Amazon and Flipkart, also cheered the policy changes while urging the government not to grant the companies more time to comply.Indian consumers may pay a price for such protectionism. A survey of common products currently available on Amazon\u2019s Indian site suggests that after sales by its affiliated companies are banned, many products will disappear and others will become more expensive because they will only be sold by small merchants who lack the clout to negotiate low wholesale prices from manufacturers.The policy changes prompted complaints from American business groups and diplomats, but the government has shown no sign of relenting.Senior officials of the commerce ministry, which issued the new rules, did not respond to several requests for comment. In recent days, they have been bombarded with thousands of emails and, in some cases, videos from small merchants urging them to take a tough line with the foreign companies.In a letter sent on Wednesday, the main traders\u2019 organization threatened the government with political repercussions if it backtracked on the policy and urged officials to investigate the past two years\u2019 of transactions made by Amazon and Flipkart.Mr. Bisen of Technopak predicted that the government would not enforce the rules aggressively for a few months, giving Amazon and Walmart time to figure out how to work within the new system. Instead of selling products, he said, they could charge fees for listing items, storing goods and delivering them.\u201cThis entire arrangement will force these guys to be service providers,\u201d Mr. Bisen said."}, {"title": "Foxconn Reconsidering Plans for a Wisconsin Factory Heralded by Trump", "category": "Business", "id": "84547d35-b5e4-45cc-96a6-0c1c0d6a92b0", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/business/foxconn-factory-wisconsin.html", "publishdate": 20190130, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/business/31foxconn01-print/merlin_146807877_0efea70f-9308-4dcc-b708-c6830649bcf7-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "It was heralded a year and a half ago as the start of a Midwestern manufacturing renaissance: Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics behemoth, would build a $10 billion Wisconsin plant to make flat-screen televisions, creating 13,000 jobs. President Trump later called the project \u201cthe eighth wonder of the world.\u201dNow that prospect looks less certain.Pointing to \u201cnew realities\u201d in the market, the company said Wednesday that it was reassessing the plans, underscoring the difficult economics of manufacturing in the United States. \u201cThe global market environment that existed when the project was first announced has changed,\u201d Foxconn said in a statement.Company officials had signaled for months that their emphasis was increasingly on research and development rather than large-scale production, dampening the potential for blue-collar job creation.That turn runs counter to Mr. Trump\u2019s vision for the project, which he had cited as a milestone in reversing the decline in factory jobs. The twist also brought new friction in Wisconsin, where the initiative has been politically fraught from the start because of its billions of dollars in tax subsidies.Foxconn said that it remained committed to creating 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin and that it was \u201cmoving forward with plans to build an advanced manufacturing facility.\u201d But economists questioned how such a large work force could be created if the plant\u2019s focus was on other areas.A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.The Foxconn statement followed a Reuters report that Louis Woo, a special assistant to the company\u2019s chairman, Terry Gou, had said the costs of manufacturing screens for televisions and other consumer products were too high in the United States.\u201cIn terms of TV, we have no place in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Woo told Reuters. \u201cWe can\u2019t compete.\u201dA later statement by Mr. Woo to The New York Times said that 25 percent of the Wisconsin work force would be dedicated to manufacturing. \u201cThe word \u2018factory\u2019 does not suitably encapsulate the broad vision we have for our Wisconsin project,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise to revitalize American manufacturing was considered an important factor in his capturing Wisconsin and other battleground states in 2016. Yet the cost of luring Foxconn set off a partisan battle in Wisconsin that extended into the midterm elections last year, when Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was defeated.Mr. Walker and state lawmakers had agreed to more than $4 billion in tax credits and other inducements over a 15-year period, an unusually high figure, for a plant in Mount Pleasant, near Racine.Wisconsin residents have had mixed feelings about the investment, polls show. And early on, economists questioned whether the large-scale manufacturing plant and the thousands of jobs would come to fruition. The increasing focus on research raised new doubts about the scale of hiring \u2014 economists said that strategy could produce a smaller number of higher-paying jobs.\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many R&D facilities in the world with 13,000 people,\u201d said Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.During the fall campaign, Wisconsin Democrats held up the Foxconn pursuit as evidence that Republicans were focused on businesses, not ordinary people \u2014 and too willing to hand out state funds to a single company.Defending their eight years in power, Republicans countered that the plant would re-establish Wisconsin\u2019s strength as a manufacturing hub, and residents in the southeastern part of the state, closest to the plant, were especially receptive.ImageMr. Trump, Gov. Scott Walker and Foxconn\u2019s chairman, Terry Gou, right, at the groundbreaking. Mr. Trump hailed the project as an example of his efforts to attract foreign investment to create manufacturing jobs.CreditEvan Vucci/Associated PressOn Wednesday, reports of Foxconn\u2019s reassessment set off a new round in that political fight. Republicans who control Wisconsin\u2019s Legislature suggested that the arrival of Gov. Tony Evers, the Democrat who ousted Mr. Walker, was partly to blame.\u201cThe company is reacting to the wave of economic uncertainty that the new governor has brought with his administration,\u201d said a statement from the Assembly\u2019s speaker, Robin Vos, and the Senate\u2019s majority leader, Scott Fitzgerald. \u201cGovernor Evers has an anti-jobs agenda.\u201dMr. Evers, who took office this month, has indicated that he would not block the Foxconn project, although he and other Democrats called it regrettable.\u201cThis deal was reckless from the beginning,\u201d said Martha Laning, the state\u2019s Democratic chairwoman. \u201cDespite multiple red flags throughout the negotiation process, Wisconsin Republicans put taxpayers on the line for $4.5 billion and rewrote the entire rule book for an election-year talking point.\u201dThe plans for the plant \u2014 including what it would produce, and the composition of its work force \u2014 have changed over time. Tim Sheehy, president of greater Milwaukee\u2019s chamber of commerce, said Foxconn had initially believed that 70 percent of its hires would be for \u201cplant floor\u201d jobs and 30 percent in design and engineering. Now, he said, those proportions have flipped.Foxconn\u2019s agreement with the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation \u201cdoes protect the state to some extent if Foxconn falls short of promised job creation,\u201d said Timothy Bartik, an economist for the Upjohn Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich. \u201cBut the capital investment tax credit, in particular, does not seem to fully adjust for this if Foxconn ends up doing a much less job-intensive and more capital-intensive project.\u201dAt this point, the cost to taxpayers across the state is likely minimal. The company has said it will forfeit tax credits for 2018 because it fell short of the hiring target on which they were based. The company did receive a sales-tax exemption on some purchases of material, Mr. Bartik said.The village of Mount Pleasant and Racine County, compared with the state, have borne most of the preliminary costs. According to village officials, Mount Pleasant acquired 99 percent of the initial 1,200 acres intended for the factory through voluntary agreements by December, and turned over at least 65 percent of the land to Foxconn.Local officials pointed out that Foxconn had already invested $200 million in Wisconsin and built a 120,000-square-foot structure.But others noted that the company had failed to follow through on grand proposals in the past. It announced in 2013 that it would invest $30 million in a high-tech factory in Pennsylvania that would create 500 jobs. The factory never materialized.The company laid out ambitious plans in Brazil, too \u2014 for 100,000 jobs. That project was mostly left on the table.\u201cFoxconn has a history of not delivering on its jobs and manufacturing commitments that it\u2019s made,\u201d said Megan Randall, a research associate at the Urban Institute in Washington. \u201cThese types of instances are exactly why accountability measures are so important in state and local tax-incentive deals.\u201dMr. Bartik said Foxconn\u2019s rationale about changing global conditions was puzzling.\u201cIt is hard for me to see how global conditions have dramatically changed the competitive position of the U.S.\u2019s labor costs in producing flat-screen TVs from when the project was announced in 2017,\u201d he said. Wage growth has accelerated as the labor market has tightened in the past year and a half, but increases have been modest.It could mean that \u201cthis project will end up mostly being a R&D operation in Madison, with a much smaller factory in southeast Wisconsin,\u201d Mr. Bartik said."}, {"title": "Apple Was Slow to Act on FaceTime Bug That Allows Spying on iPhones", "category": "Business", "id": "6ea14ceb-0802-4346-b897-a5741163039b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/technology/facetime-glitch-apple.html", "publishdate": 20190130, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/business/30FACEPALM03/merlin_149937243_cef3a2dd-c60d-4bc5-ae43-e5b1857b39d4-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 On Jan. 19, Grant Thompson, a 14-year-old in Arizona, made an unexpected discovery: Using FaceTime, Apple\u2019s video chatting software, he could eavesdrop on his friend\u2019s phone before his friend had even answered the call.His mother, Michele Thompson, sent a video of the hack to Apple the next day, warning the company of a \u201cmajor security flaw\u201d that exposed millions of iPhone users to eavesdropping. When she didn\u2019t hear from Apple Support, she exhausted every other avenue she could, including emailing and faxing Apple\u2019s security team, and posting to Twitter and Facebook. On Friday, Apple\u2019s product security team encouraged Ms. Thompson, a lawyer, to set up a developer account to send a formal bug report.But it wasn\u2019t until Monday, more than a week after Ms. Thompson first notified Apple of the problem, that Apple raced to disable Group FaceTime and said it was working on a fix. The company reacted after a separate developer reported the FaceTime flaw and it was written about on 9to5mac.com, a news site for Apple fans, in an article that went viral.The bug, and Apple\u2019s slow response to patching it, have renewed concerns about the company\u2019s commitment to security, even though it regularly advertises its bug reward program and boasts about the safety of its products. Hours before Apple\u2019s statement addressing the bug Monday, Tim Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, tweeted that \u201cwe all must insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.\u201dThe FaceTime problem has already been branded \u201cFacePalm\u201d by security researchers, who say Apple\u2019s security team should have known better. Rarely is there a software flaw that grants such high-level remote access and is so easy to manipulate: By adding a second person to a group FaceTime call, you can capture the audio and video of the first person called before that person answers the phone, or even if the person never answers.\u201cIf these kinds of bugs are slipping through,\u201d said Patrick Wardle, the co-founder of Digita Security, which focuses on Apple-related security, \u201cyou have to wonder if there are other problematic bugs that other hackers are exploiting that should have been caught.\u201d[Read how to disable FaceTime to avoid the eavesdropping bug.]On Monday, Apple said it was aware of the issue and had \u201cidentified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week.\u201dBut the company has not addressed how the flaw passed through quality assurance, why it was so slow to respond to Ms. Thompson\u2019s urgent warnings, or whether it intends to reward the teenager whose mother raced to alert the company to the bug in the first place.A bug this easy to exploit is every company\u2019s worst security nightmare and every spy agency, cybercriminal and stalker\u2019s dream. In emails to Apple\u2019s product security team, Ms. Thompson noted that she and her son were just everyday citizens who believed they had uncovered a flaw that could undermine national security.\u201cMy fear is that this flaw could be used for nefarious purposes,\u201d she wrote in a letter provided to The New York Times. \u201cAlthough this certainly raises privacy and security issues for private individuals, there is the potential that this could impact national security if, for example, government members were to fall victim to this eavesdropping flaw.\u201dImageApple has disabled Group FaceTime and is working on a fix to be released in a software update this week.CreditAndy Wong/Associated PressUnknown to Ms. Thompson, there is a healthy market for bugs and the code to weaponize them, which allow governments, defense contractors and cybercriminals to invisibly spy on people\u2019s devices without their knowledge, capturing everything from their locations to information caught on their microphones and cameras. The FaceTime flaw, and other Apple bugs, can fetch tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, from dozens of brokers. Those brokers then sell those bugs for ever higher sums to governments and intelligence and law enforcement agencies around the world. On the seedier side of the spectrum are brokers who will sell these tools on the dark web to the highest bidder.The only catch is that hackers must promise never to disclose the flaw to the vendor for patching, so that buyers can keep their access.The market for Apple flaws has soared in the post-Edward Snowden era as technology makers include more security, like end-to-end encryption, to thwart would-be spies. This month, Zerodium, a well-known broker and security firm, raised its reward for an Apple iOS bug to $2 million.In part to compete in that market, and reward those who do right by the company by notifying it of potentially lucrative bugs, Apple announced its own bounty program in 2016 \u2014 the last of the Silicon Valley companies to do so.At a hacker conference that year in Las Vegas, Apple made a surprise announcement: It said it would start paying rewards as high as $200,000 to hackers who responsibly turned over crucial flaws in its products. But the bounty program has been slow going, in part, hackers say, because they can make multiples of that bounty on the black market, and because Apple has taken its time rewarding them for reporting problems.The FacePalm bug is a particularly egregious case, researchers say, not just because it was discovered by a teenager simply trying to use his phone, but because it allowed full microphone and video access.\u201cThis is a bug that Apple\u2019s Q.A., should have caught,\u201d Mr. Wardle said. \u201cAnd where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s almost always fire.\u201dBug brokers say FacePalm, while impressive, would not have brought a top price because it leaves a record of the attack. The flaw works only if you FaceTime the person you want to capture audio and video for, notifying your target of the call.Bugs that fetch $2 million or $3 million on the black market leave no trace, work more than 99.5 percent of the time and work instantaneously, said Adriel Desautels, the chief executive of Netragard, a company that helps firms protect their software.In this case, Mr. Desautels said, FacePalm is not as dangerous as a flaw that can covertly track someone\u2019s location, turn on that person\u2019s camera and capture video without a trace.But, he added, \u201cit\u2019s pretty good for a high schooler.\u201d"}, {"title": "Does Facebook Really Know How Many Fake Accounts It Has?", "category": "Business", "id": "c8b6e952-109f-48a1-87df-631494810697", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/technology/facebook-fake-accounts.html", "publishdate": 20190130, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/business/31fakebook/30fakebook-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "ImageCreditWren McDonaldFacebook sells advertisers on its access to real people \u2014 2.32 billion of them, a network that exceeds the populations of North America, South America and Africa combined.But do that many people really use Facebook? The answer lies partly in how many of the accounts are fake. The Silicon Valley company defines fake accounts as profiles that are either designed to break its rules, for example by spammers or scammers impersonating others, or that are misclassified, such as someone setting up a Facebook profile instead of a Facebook page for a business.Yet the number of Facebook accounts that fit those descriptions is less clear. While the company discloses its estimates of fake accounts, its figures have fluctuated and are confusing. Even Facebook admits its understanding of the numbers is tenuous. \u201cDuplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale,\u201d it said in a securities filing in October, and the actual numbers \u201cmay vary significantly from our estimates.\u201d With Facebook reporting a jump in the number of fake accounts on its site on Wednesday, let\u2019s dig into what figures it has given before \u2014 and why they don\u2019t necessarily add up. That has implications for the manipulation and abuse of the platform, as well as the company\u2019s business.A moving target First take a look at how Facebook\u2019s estimates for fake accounts, made in securities filings, have oscillated in recent years:What the table shows is that Facebook cut its estimate of fake accounts significantly in 2016. A year later, it more than quadrupled the estimate. And on Wednesday, in small print at the bottom of a slide about earnings, Facebook increased the estimate by 36 percent, to 116 million. So what\u2019s going on?Facebook arrives at its estimates by analyzing a sample of accounts, looking \u201cfor names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic,\u201d the company said in securities filings. \u201cWe apply significant judgment in making this determination.\u201dAlex Schultz, Facebook\u2019s vice president of analytics, said in an interview that its fake account estimates fluctuated in part because periodic attacks can cause spikes in the figures. He added that Facebook had grown in some emerging markets where fake accounts are more prevalent.A pile of new fakesFor years, investors, analysts and journalists had only Facebook\u2019s estimates to judge fake accounts. Last year, Facebook introduced a transparency page, which discloses how many fake accounts it has taken down each quarter. Those figures revealed that the scope was far larger than the estimates in securities filings had suggested.Let\u2019s run through the math on this in more detail. Facebook\u2019s new numbers added up to more than 2.8 billion fake accounts taken down in the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, or about 7.7 million a day.Facebook had previously reported that about 3 percent to 4 percent of its active users were fake. According to the new figures, the accounts taken down each quarter were equivalent to 25 percent to 35 percent of its active users (though those accounts were not counted in Facebook\u2019s active-user tallies because they had been removed).More curious was how Facebook\u2019s estimate of active fake accounts barely budged even as the number of accounts it took down each quarter fluctuated widely. For instance, Facebook said it had caught 583 million fake accounts in the first quarter of 2018 and 800 million the next quarter. Yet between those two quarters, it told investors that its active fake accounts had increased by roughly one million. Those numbers suggest either that Facebook happens to be eliminating exactly enough accounts each quarter to keep its active fake-account estimate flat \u2014 or that its estimate is more like a guess.\u201cYou can use your judgment,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research who discovered last year that Facebook was claiming it could reach more people in the United States than the Census Bureau said lived in the country. \u201cI think there are reasons to be skeptical of the numbers they put forward.\u201dFacebook\u2019s figures also imply that over the past year, it has caught and taken down roughly 90 percent of fake accounts that are created on its site \u2014 most, it said, \u201cwithin minutes of registration.\u201d Facebook said it also stopped millions of fake accounts from registering each day. Mr. Schultz said such a success rate was possible because \u201cthe vast majority of accounts we take down are from extremely na\u00efve adversaries,\u201d who typically create automated accounts that are easy to spot. The smaller number of fake accounts that elude detection are generally manually created accounts. Mr. Schultz added that Facebook was cautious in removing manually created accounts because it didn\u2019t want to erase authentic profiles. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to over-enforce,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what we actually focus on is the harmful behavior.\u201dYet obvious fake accounts that are engaging in harmful behavior slip through. Last year, I found dozens of fake accounts masquerading as the company\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, to scam Facebook users out of cash. Some had been up for years.Facebook also said the vast majority of fake accounts it removed were ones that it had spotted, rather than ones that users had reported. Of the 2.8 billion fake accounts it took down in the year that ended Sept. 30, Facebook said, it found 99.3 percent on its own.Those numbers also contradict my experience. Last year, I easily created 11 Facebook accounts that used the same name, occupation and profile photo as my verified account. They remained live for five days, until I reported them to Facebook. Instagram, which Facebook owns, also left up 10 impostor accounts I had created until I reported them; it took down only five, until I alerted a Facebook spokesman. If an account appears to be impersonating another user but isn\u2019t \u201cengaged in harmful behavior,\u201d Facebook often leaves it up, Mr. Schultz said. He said such duplicate accounts could be from people who had lost their password or were confused. Duplicate accounts add to confusion Duplicate accounts are banned under Facebook\u2019s rules. But they persist anyway, in even greater numbers than fake accounts, according to the company\u2019s estimates, compounding its problem of inauthentic activity.Facebook\u2019s estimates of duplicates have also seesawed, including nearly doubling in 2017. On Wednesday, Facebook increased its count by 20 percent, to 255 million. Take a look at the chart below.Aaron Greenspan, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s Harvard University classmate who now tracks Facebook, issued a report last week questioning how many authentic users Facebook has. Mr. Greenspan, who started a site called \u201cthe Face Book\u201d while at Harvard and settled a trademark dispute with Facebook in 2009, said he believed the social network had far more fake accounts than it had disclosed, posing a grave risk to its business.\u201cThe fact there are so many unexplained differences and so many gaps, it paints a picture that, when you combine all these factors together, it would indicate there\u2019s something going on here that they\u2019re trying to hide,\u201d he said.Mr. Schultz said Facebook was doing its best to police inauthentic accounts and be as transparent as possible about how many it believed were still on its site. \u201cWe disclose it very publicly, in my opinion,\u201d he said. When I asked him how advertisers felt about paying to show ads to fake accounts, Mr. Schultz said, \u201cWhat advertisers need to feel comfortable about are the actual results generated by our ad campaigns.\u201d"}, {"title": "Is There Room in 2020 for a Centrist Democrat?

Monochrome and male, they do not embody social change and few hold out the promise of making history. Among them are former mayors, like Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans; current and former governors, including John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Terry McAuliffe of Virginia; Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado; and a smattering of House members. Atop the pack is a former vice president: Joseph R. Biden Jr.If they run, these Democrats would test whether there is a large audience of primary voters open to promises of incremental change and political compromise, or whether the ascendant liberal wing is now fully dominant, defining the party\u2019s agenda around transformational goals like enacting single-payer health care and breaking up big banks.In most cases, these Democrats are framing their moderate instincts in terms of political process \u2014 stressing their willingness to cooperate with Republicans \u2014 or fiscal and economic concerns, including sensitivity to private business and government debt. They largely agree with more liberal Democrats on issues like guns, abortion and gay rights, which once divided the party.Mr. Bloomberg offered an uncommonly tart rendition of this cohort\u2019s worldview in New Hampshire on Tuesday, warning that a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care policy would \u201cbankrupt\u201d the country. He also dismissed a proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, to impose an annual wealth tax on enormous personal fortunes, as \u201cprobably unconstitutional.\u201d Ms. Warren engaged the fight, branding Mr. Bloomberg on Twitter as a billionaire who wants to \u201ckeep a rigged system in place.\u201dVideoHoward Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks who said he was considering a run for president as an independent, was heckled at a book event in New York.CreditCreditKathy Willens/Associated PressIf Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s views grate on many Democrats, allies see it as a distinctive trait in a diffuse primary. Howard Wolfson, an adviser to the former mayor, said the current Democratic field seemed to invite a competitor closer to the center.\u201cWe believe that there is a clear and sufficiently wide lane for a pragmatic candidate, and that the progressive lane is really crowded,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said. \u201cThe pragmatic lane is relatively free.\u201dPolls suggest that somewhere between a third and half of Democratic voters see themselves as moderates, though the label is vague enough to cast doubt on the group\u2019s cohesion.That bloc, these candidates and their advisers acknowledge, could lose influence if a herd of self-styled pragmatists end up stampeding into the Democratic contest, atomizing the center even as progressive competitors carve up the left. It is also highly uncertain that Democrats, who celebrated the election of many women and candidates of color in 2018, would turn quickly in 2020 to nominating a white man with narrower governing ambitions.In the early primary states, much of the action so far has focused on proudly liberal, potentially history-making candidates, including Ms. Warren and Senators Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.But former Gov. John Lynch of New Hampshire, a centrist Democrat, said he saw a clear opening for a candidacy pitched at the middle, one that is attentive to matters like climate change but also sensitive to deficits and debt. Mr. Lynch named Mr. Biden and Mr. Bloomberg as the two most compelling possibilities.\u201cI\u2019d like to see somebody come in and make the case for electing a more moderate candidate,\u201d Mr. Lynch said, \u201cand I believe that if the Democrats want to beat President Trump, their best bet is electing somebody in the middle.\u201dImageHoward Schultz, the former Starbucks chief executive, is mulling an independent run for the presidency.CreditJohannes Eisele/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesMr. Lynch cautioned that the chances for an avowed moderate would fade if too many people compete for the label: \u201cIf there are a couple of moderates, then they are going to take share away from each other.\u201dThe road to the Democratic nomination would likely be fraught for any moderate, especially one who would not break a historic barrier by virtue of identity, as Barack Obama did in 2008. To some Democrats, a more centrist message might too closely echo Hillary Clinton\u2019s unsuccessful 2016 campaign, which left many in the party determined to focus on mobilizing the left over pursuing the middle. And the most vocal Democratic factions have shown little interest so far in settling for something other than a liberal champion, on issues from taxation and business regulation to criminal justice and gender equality.Ms. Warren has emerged as something of an intellectual pacesetter for liberal Democrats on economic issues, including her proposal to tax the wealth of households with assets greater than $50 million at a rate of two or three percent per year. And on Monday Ms. Harris, whose signature proposal has been a more conventional middle-class tax cut, called in a CNN interview for the elimination of private health insurance as part of a shift toward a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d single-payer health care.Several other liberals of differing stripes are likely to join the race soon, including Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Cory Booker of New Jersey; others are considering it seriously, like Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jeff Merkley of Oregon.Polls of Democratic voters offer mixed signals about how liberal they want their nominee to be. There is no question the party has moved leftward: the Gallup Poll found this month that for the first time in decades, a majority of Democrats describe themselves as liberal, while just 34 percent now call themselves moderate. And taxing the rich is broadly popular, with a sizable majority of Americans believing wealthy people and corporations pay too little to the government.\u201cPeople have grown more liberal and more willing to call themselves liberal,\u201d said Lydia Saad, a senior editor at Gallup, cautioning that ideology did not necessarily predict voting behavior: \u201cThe public is very fungible in terms of who they will accept as a leader, based on things that seem to go beyond ideology.\u201dArkadi Gerney, a Democratic strategist who runs the Hub Project, a liberal advocacy group that has focused heavily on taxes, said that intensive issue polling had consistently found powerful support for raising taxes on the wealthy, not just among Democrats but also among working-class white voters in Mr. Trump\u2019s base.VideoFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. defended his decision to laud an embattled Republican lawmaker during a paid speech last year.CreditCreditYuri Gripas/Reuters\u201cThe thing that was consistently the most popular in those experiments was: raise taxes on the rich,\u201d Mr. Gerney said. \u201cIt is tapping into anger that a lot of people have.\u201dYet there are also signs of hesitation among some Democrats about shifting left. A January study by the Pew Research Center found that 53 percent of Democrats want the party to become more moderate, compared with 40 percent who want it to grow more liberal. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that while single-payer health care is hugely popular among Democrats, half of the party\u2019s voters want House Democrats to prioritize improving the Affordable Care Act over passing Medicare for All legislation.Mr. Biden and Mr. Bloomberg, both 76, have defended their relatively centrist approach in recent weeks, calling it the best way to win and govern. Mr. Biden described working with Republicans as a first principle at a Washington event last week; without that spirit, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you get anything done.\u201d And Mr. Bloomberg swatted at the left more bluntly in New Hampshire.Either man could seek to monopolize the party\u2019s moderate constituencies: Mr. Biden through his stature as a two-term vice president, Mr. Bloomberg by spending his multibillion-dollar fortune. Both have already faced criticism for having supported aggressive policing and crime policies; Mr. Biden has expressed some regret for his record, while Mr. Bloomberg has defended his.If Mr. Biden and Mr. Bloomberg do not run, there could be no well-known candidate positioned near the center. That could create space for a lower-profile moderate to emerge, or perhaps vindicate Mr. Schultz\u2019s assessment that there is scant popular demand in the Democratic Party for a 1990s-style economic program of spending restraint and deference toward the private sector.Two wild-card Democrats who could run toward the middle, strategists say, are Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas Senate candidate. Both are widely liked by liberals but have shown a preference for conciliation and compromise. It is unclear how they would present themselves, ideologically, if they run.Matt Bennett, vice president of the centrist Democratic group Third Way, said that for any moderate to catch fire in 2020, it would require more than offering toned-down versions of liberal candidates\u2019 policies and \u201ceat your peas\u201d lectures about government debt.\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to be aspirational, optimistic, future-oriented,\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \u201cLike Bill Clinton, like Barack Obama.\u201d"}, {"title": "Tesla Profit Declines, but Musk Says Cash Position Is Strong", "category": "Business", "id": "104663a0-8046-4dbf-820a-316bd48f0370", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/business/tesla-earnings-elon-musk.html", "publishdate": 20190130, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/business/31TESLA-2/merlin_149370243_f5f5be54-7c8e-456a-82d0-ed89caa1b5ea-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Tesla has now shown it can make money \u2014 it reported its second consecutive quarterly profit on Wednesday, the first time it has done so \u2014 but the automaker still faces many challenges as it seeks to keep its growth going.The Model 3 sedan still costs too much to produce. The company has set an ambitious goal of churning out cars from a new factory in China by the end of the year. And it struggles to provide the kind of customer service that buyers of luxury automobiles expect. Tesla also is planning to spend heavily on a new model even as a big bond payment reduces its cash reserves.Still, Elon Musk, the chief executive, says he believes Tesla\u2019s toughest times are behind it.\u201cThis is going to be an amazing year for Tesla,\u201d he said on a conference call to discuss the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about being profitable in the first quarter, and all quarters going forward.\u201dThe automaker\u2019s earnings in the final three months of 2018 leave some doubt about whether its profits will continue to grow. It reported $139 million in earnings in the fourth quarter, a substantial drop from the third quarter, despite a nearly 6 percent jump in revenue, to $7.2 billion.The company blamed the introduction of lower-priced Model 3 variants that generate less profit than costlier versions, price cuts on the vehicles it exports to China and fewer sales of emissions credits to other carmakers.Tesla said it had $3.7 billion in cash, an increase of about $700 million from Sept. 30. With that rise, Tesla said it would be able to make a $920 million payment to its bondholders in March, solving one of the most critical questions about the company\u2019s finances.Investors had been concerned about how Tesla would pay off the bonds, fearing the company could be left squeezed for cash. Tesla could have made part of the bond payment in stock if its share price had been above $360, a level it exceeded for part of last year.The shares closed Wednesday at $308.77 but dropped nearly 5 percent in aftermarket trading after the company announced that its chief financial officer, Deepak Ahuja, would retire without saying exactly when.Tesla said its revenue rose nearly 6 percent to $7.2 billion.Mr. Musk predicted the company would deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars this year, up from 245,000 in 2018, driven by higher sales of the Model 3. The company also said it anticipated lower North American vehicle sales in the current quarter compared to the fourth quarter. At the same time, it expects to begin sales in Europe and China.ImageRows of new Tesla Model 3 electric vehicles in Richmond, Calif., last year. Mr. Musk complained of \u201cdelivery logistics hell\u201d as the model came off the production line.CreditStephen Lam/ReutersThe company also said it anticipated lower North American vehicle sales in the current quarter compared to the fourth quarter.Some analysts believe increasing sales may prove tough, now that sales of the Model S luxury sedan and Model X S.U.V. are flattening, and the federal tax credit available to Tesla customers has fallen to $3,750 as of Jan. 1. Last year, customers were eligible for credits of $7,500. And soon it will face competition from other luxury car makers.\u201cTesla\u2019s product lineup is starting to get stale, and now thanks to the elimination of the federal tax credit, buying one has never been more expensive,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst at Edmunds, an auto-information provider. \u201cWhile there\u2019s still a cool factor to owning a Tesla, it may not be enough to convince buyers to choose one over brand-new models from Audi, Porsche and Jaguar.\u201dTesla\u2019s most affordable car is a midrange variant of the Model 3 that starts at $44,000 before tax incentives. Adding options can push the price up to $70,000 or more \u2014 well outside the range of most mainstream buyers.Tesla originally promised that the Model 3 would start at $35,000, but Mr. Musk has said the automaker would lose money if it sold the car at that price now. Earlier this month, he said the company would cut 3,000 jobs \u2014 about 7 percent of its full-time work force \u2014 to reduce costs.Tesla is investing heavily to add showrooms, service centers and charging stations, expand into additional markets and develop new models. These include an electric pickup truck, a semi truck and a small sport-utility vehicle, the Model Y, which Tesla has said it will unveil this year.Mr. Musk has repeatedly said Tesla won\u2019t issue more bonds or sell additional stock to finance its ambitious plans, but many analysts are skeptical. The company is already carrying nearly $10 billion in debt. Issuing new bonds would increase its debt load. Selling additional stock could worry investors.At one time, Tesla said it had more than 400,000 reservations for the Model 3, enough to keep sales and production humming through 2019. Some were deposits on the $35,000 version of the Model 3Mr. Musk said Tesla aimed to start production of the Model 3 in China by the end of the year, at a factory that has not yet been built. Producing cars in China will enable Tesla to avoid that country\u2019s import tariffs that hamper its sales now.The company will also have to spend heavily to build more delivery centers in the United States. Last fall, as Model 3 sales rose, many customers experienced delivery delays and confusion at the company\u2019s showrooms. Others complained of waiting weeks or months for repairs because of severe parts shortages. Some have reported quality problems that vary from cracked windows to rear bumpers falling off.On the conference call, Mr. Musk said improving customer service in North America was his top priority this year."}, {"title": "Maybe Only Tim Cook Can Fix Facebook\u2019s Privacy Problem", "category": "Business", "id": "d33e0f1c-89aa-443b-9b19-a3bc4a2b2af3", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/technology/facebook-privacy-apple-tim-cook.html", "publishdate": 20190131, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/business/31ROOSE01/31ROOSE01-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "It\u2019s nowhere in his job description, but Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has recently taken a moonlight gig as Facebook\u2019s privacy watchdog.On Wednesday, Mr. Cook and his lieutenants took aim at Facebook for violating Apple\u2019s rules with a research app that allowed Facebook to snoop on users\u2019 online activity. Facebook promoted the app through an Apple program that gives trusted developers the ability to install apps for testing without going through the App Store\u2019s normal approval process. Apple responded by cutting off Facebook\u2019s access to apps and updates that it was working on internally, causing chaos among the company\u2019s software engineers.The move is the clearest sign yet that the cold war between Facebook and Apple over data use and privacy is heating up.Mr. Cook, who has called privacy a \u201cfundamental human right\u201d and taken Facebook and Google to task for the misuse of user data in the past, could effectively become a technology regulator of last resort \u2014 using the power of Apple\u2019s iOS operating system as a cudgel to force software companies to respect user privacy and play by the rules, or risk losing access to millions of iPhone users.The latest battle came on Wednesday, after TechCrunch reported on a Facebook program, known as Project Atlas, that paid users $20 in exchange for installing an app for Apple devices called Facebook Research. The program, offered to teenagers as well as adults, gave Facebook the ability to track app use, the websites users visited, the Amazon purchases they made and other intimate data.The problem is that Facebook loaded the app onto users\u2019 devices using a kind of fast-track installation that bypasses Apple\u2019s normal App Store download process. This ability, known as side-loading, is available only to companies that are enrolled in Apple\u2019s enterprise developer program, and that agree to side-load apps only for internal testing, not for public use.Apple was not happy, and cut off Facebook\u2019s enterprise developer access for all of its apps, not just the offending research app.\u201cWe designed our Enterprise Developer Program solely for the internal distribution of apps within an organization,\u201d an Apple spokesman said. \u201cFacebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple.\u201dFacebook, which reported strong earnings on Wednesday despite the missteps, is negotiating with Apple to restore its developer access. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment.ImageMr. Cook and his lieutenants took aim at Facebook for violating Apple\u2019s rules with a research app that allowed Facebook to snoop on users\u2019 online activity.CreditJim Young/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images(On Wednesday, TechCrunch reported that Google had a similar research app, called Screenwise Meter. In a statement, Google said it was disabling the app, which it said \u201cshould not have operated under Apple\u2019s developer enterprise program.\u201d)There\u2019s no doubt that Apple took a firm stand here. But if Mr. Cook truly wants to protect Apple users from privacy-violating apps, he could remove all of Facebook\u2019s products \u2014 including Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 from the App Store until the company can prove, in a real and measurable way, that it cares about its users\u2019 privacy.Shutting off Facebook\u2019s access to Apple devices would be a radical step, tantamount to declaring war on a major competitor. But Apple has banned developers for smaller infractions in the past. And in the absence of government regulation, there may be no other option for bringing the company to heel on privacy.Would temporarily cutting off Facebook\u2019s Apple apps be an effective deterrent? Absolutely. In less than a day, Apple\u2019s move to revoke Facebook\u2019s developer certificate has reportedly become a \u201ccritical problem\u201d for the company\u2019s developers. Hundreds of millions of people use Facebook through their iPhones, and without access to Apple\u2019s App Store, Facebook would see an immediate and devastating hit to its bottom line. The ban would quickly become an existential threat, and improving privacy on its apps would become an all-hands-on-deck project for the company\u2019s leadership.Would it be fair? Yes. Facebook\u2019s privacy violations over the years have been appalling, and its executives have blatantly evaded the rules that Google and Apple, the makers of the two largest mobile operating systems, have put in place to protect their users from being exploited by data-hungry app developers. In emails released late last year, Facebook executives were shown plotting to snoop on Android users\u2019 call and text logs without triggering a permission pop-up. And Facebook\u2019s Onavo VPN app was pulled from Apple\u2019s App Store last year for excessive data collection.Would cracking down on Facebook backfire on Apple? Possibly. Facebook\u2019s apps are some of the most popular offerings on Apple devices, and without access to their Instagram and Facebook feeds, some iPhone users might get frustrated and switch to Android. But this abandonment would happen slowly, not all at once. (IPhone users could still access Facebook\u2019s products through their mobile web browsers.) And more likely, given how heavily Facebook relies on Apple\u2019s platform, Facebook would almost certainly blink first, and make the necessary changes to get back into Apple\u2019s good graces.Is such a big crackdown necessary? It probably is, if Apple is truly serious about protecting privacy. Time and time again, Facebook has shown that it cannot be trusted to protect users\u2019 privacy unless it is forced to do so. And while regulators have fined Facebook for privacy violations, those punishments rarely amount to anything truly meaningful \u2014 at most, the company pays a few million dollars, promises to do better next time, and goes right back to work.Would punishing Facebook be an abuse of Apple\u2019s power? Arguably, yes. It\u2019s problematic that by virtue of their strangleholds on the Apple and Android operating systems, Apple and Google have control over huge swaths of the tech industry. And Apple\u2019s own record on privacy is hardly spotless \u2014 just this week, the company was forced to shut down the FaceTime feature because of a bug that let users snoop on one another\u2019s phones.But aggressive behavior among tech companies, for much less noble motives, is business as usual \u2014 Facebook, for example, routinely cuts off data access to rival apps like Twitter, Vine, and Prisma. And until government regulators impose rules on the tech giants, the most effective regulation on tech industry excesses may need to happen between companies.It\u2019s bizarre and somewhat troubling that Apple could unilaterally punish a competitor for its privacy sins. (Imagine if McDonald\u2019s could shut down Burger King franchises for health code violations, with little explanation and no recourse for appeal.) But it\u2019s hard to argue with Apple\u2019s decision here.

Apple reported on Tuesday that its revenue was down in part because consumers are buying new phones less frequently, and the chipmakers NVIDIA and Intel both indicated weakening demand for the components they build for data centers.But on Wednesday, Microsoft showed solid performance across its commercial and consumer businesses, reporting revenue of almost $32.5 billion in the last quarter, and a profit of almost $8.6 billion, both increases of more than 10 percent over the same period a year ago.Microsoft had handily beat analyst expectations recently. In the last quarter, the results fell mostly in line with what investors expected, and shares fell about 2.5 percent in aftermarket trading, wiping out most of the gains made earlier in the day.The company continued its shift to cloud computing, which allows businesses to store and analyze their data in remote centers. Its offering is now widely seen as the strong No. 2 in the market that had once been dominated only by Amazon.Satya Nadella, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a call with investors that Microsoft was not seeing a slowing in demand. \u201cIt\u2019s very healthy and will continue to be healthy.\u201dThe company\u2019s consumer products also did well during the holiday season, with a 39 percent increase in sales of Surface tablets and laptops compared with the same quarter in 2017. Sales of its high-margin Windows operating system fell, which the company tied to a continuing shortage in computer chips.The last quarter illustrated Microsoft\u2019s increasing strength. At times, it surpassed Apple and Amazon to become the most valuable company in the world, which was both a sign of its resurgence and the stumbles faced by its peers. The company announced a series of major, multiyear partnerships with large customers that validate a bet by Mr. Nadella to shift the company\u2019s focus to cloud computing and away from personal computers.A few months ago, Microsoft indicated that its rapid global expansion of data centers would moderate this year, but it signaled this was more about making the best use of all its capacity rather than a sign that customers were less interested in cloud-based services.\u201cWe think this is cyclicality \u2014 you build then you grow, you build then you grow,\u201d said Jennifer Lowe, an analyst who covers the company for UBS.Sales for Azure, Microsoft\u2019s core cloud computing offering, were up 76 percent over the same period last year, the same pace as last quarter. This is a slower growth rate than 2017 and the first half of 2018, but analysts say that mostly reflects how big the business has gotten.\u201cAzure outperformed, so fears of a deceleration in that business are misplaced,\u201d said Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel.And Microsoft\u2019s overall commercial cloud computing revenue, which includes both Azure and subscriptions to cloud-based Office 365, grew 48 percent, to $9 billion.\u201cThey haven\u2019t just changed the product set \u2014 they have literally changed the culture, and they are really acting like a cloud platform,\u201d Mr. Reback said. He added that Microsoft uses the constant flow of data passing though its cloud computing services to develop and improve its products and sales more quickly.Microsoft has found success in offering a so-called hybrid cloud offering, in which customers keep some data on their own servers and others in the cloud and manage it all with a single set of tools. Analysts say the company has an advantage over Amazon in that area, because so many large business already use Microsoft tools on their servers.Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s chief financial officer, pointed to 24 percent growth in server products and cloud services revenue as an indicator of strength in that business. She said that figure includes pure Azure sales as well as premium traditional server sales that can be managed together. \u201cThat gives customers flexibility to decide when to move,\u201d she said.Some customers adopt Azure just for basic cloud computing, but Microsoft is looking for ways to bring technology deeper into how businesses operate, what Mr. Nadella has called embracing \u201ctech intensity.\u201d\u201cThe opportunity for our shareholders when they think about Microsoft has never been better,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in a call with analysts. He said Microsoft\u2019s interests align with those of its customers, because the company\u2019s cloud products often bring in revenue from subscriptions and use rather than large upfront costs. \u201cWe want to make sure we are in fact making our customers fully capable digital customers in their own right,\u201d he said.Microsoft and Kroger are working to develop cloud-connected physical retail stores, with new products like digital price tags and sensors to track shoppers and show them customized ads. Another partnership, with Walgreens Boots Alliance in the pharmacy sphere, aims to use artificial intelligence to improve health care outcomes.\u201cIt\u2019s not just how to get you to buy Windows,\u201d Ms. Lowe said. \u201cTechnology is going to get deeper into the guts of how companies operate.\u201d"}, {"title": "U.S. Job Gains Show Employers Shrugged Off Government Shutdown", "category": "Business", "id": "9aa6f993-e6a3-48d6-894e-c2e83e927b81", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/economy/jobs-report.html", "publishdate": 20190131, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/business/jobs-jan-19-promo/jobs-jan-19-promo-articleLarge.png", "content": "Add the recent government shutdown to the list of things that didn\u2019t slow the American job market.Over the past eight years, the American economy has endured trade tensions, debt-limit standoffs, foreign-policy crises and all manner of natural disasters. Through it all, companies kept on hiring.The resilience continued in January as employers shrugged off both the monthlong shutdown and fears of an economic slowdown to add 304,000 jobs, far more than forecasters had anticipated. The report from the Labor Department marked the 100th consecutive month of job gains, more than double the previous record.\u201cThis jobs report is showing no evidence of an economy slowing, certainly not falling into recession,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, chief United States economist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cIt\u2019s still a tight labor market. Employers are still actively looking for jobs, and with wages ticking up, it looks like workers are getting some more bargaining power.\u201dFriday\u2019s report does not mean the economy escaped the shutdown unscathed. The Congressional Budget Office this week estimated that the funding lapse shaved $11 billion off total output, $3 billion of which will never be recovered. Those totals don\u2019t include indirect costs from permits not issued, loans not processed and flights not taken because of delays at airports.The effects on spending, investment and output should show up in other government reports, some of which were themselves delayed by the shutdown.Those disruptions didn\u2019t deter employers, however. The unemployment rate rose slightly, to 4 percent, at least partly because of the idling of hundreds of thousands of federal workers. But hiring in the private sector was strong and broad-based, with manufacturers, retailers and construction companies all adding jobs. Wage growth, which has picked up in recent months after years of sluggish gains, remained solid, and the strong labor market continued to pull in workers from the sidelines.The Labor Department did revise downward its estimate of December hiring by 90,000 jobs, an unusually large adjustment. But the strong growth in January, combined with upward revisions to earlier months, meant that the pace of hiring, averaged over six months, actually rose.That combination of strong hiring and modest wage gains has put the economy on a strong, sustainable footing. More jobs means more income for consumers, which leads to more spending, and in turn more hiring.\u201cThe virtuous cycle continues,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist for Barclays. \u201cWhat\u2019s kept this recovery going, what\u2019s kept the U.S. economy so resilient to all the things that have clouded the outlook, is a virtuous cycle of a continuously growing U.S. labor market.\u201dNone of the threats to the economy over the past several years have disrupted that central pattern. The shutdown, for example, caused ripple effects throughout the private sector, but companies and businesses also found ways to cope. Ben Herzon, an economist for Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm, said that as a result, the shutdown\u2019s economic impact might be more muted than simple economic models might suggest. \u201cThe economy is resilient,\u201d Mr. Herzon said. \u201cPeople and businesses find a way to work around these disruptions. People want to buy stuff, and businesses want to find a way to make that happen.\u201dJames Diana and his wife started JD\u2019s Canine Cruiser, a dog-walking and pet-sitting business in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, in 2012. The area\u2019s strong economy has allowed them to expand the business and bring on more contract employees, many of whom are at-home parents and others who might not find work in a less robust economy.Many of Mr. Diana\u2019s customers are federal employees or contractors, and the shutdown hit his business hard. He said cancellations in January were roughly double their normal level, costing him thousands of dollars in lost business. Government workers, he noted, will get back pay, but that won\u2019t help him.\u201cThat actually is lost income for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get their money back. I\u2019m not going to get my money back.\u201dMr. Diana said he pared his own spending, but he also tried to fill in the gap in his business. He doubled down on efforts to find new customers, including on Thumbtack, an online marketplace for hiring people to complete tasks. \u201cIt forced me to go out there and get more clients,\u201d he said \u2014 to \u201creally get out there and start cranking.\u201dA Hidden Shutdown?The relative invisibility of the shutdown in Friday\u2019s data wasn\u2019t a total surprise. Because federal workers will receive back pay, the figures counted all of them as having been on payrolls in January, even if they weren\u2019t actually on the job.Government contractors generally won\u2019t receive back pay, so if they didn\u2019t work, they weren\u2019t counted. Ditto for other private-sector workers who were laid off (or weren\u2019t hired) because of the shutdown. But most economists expected those effects to be small in an economy that employs more than 150 million people. Sure enough, private employers added nearly 300,000 jobs last month.MORE ON THE SHUTDOWN AND THE ECONOMYGovernment Shutdown Shakes Stability of Jobs That Are Often the Best AroundJan. 16, 2019Shutdown\u2019s Economic Damage Starts to Pile Up, Threatening an End to GrowthJan. 15, 2019Federal Shutdown\u2019s Uneven Toll: Some Americans Are Devastated, Others ObliviousJan. 11, 2019The shutdown does help explain why the unemployment rate ticked up in January. Unlike the monthly hiring figures, which come from a survey of employers and are based on their payrolls, the unemployment rate is based on a survey of households. In that survey, 175,000 more people than in December reported themselves as being unemployed because of a \u201ctemporary layoff\u201d \u2014 a total that included government workers.\u201cWhere\u2019s your shutdown impact? There it is,\u201d said Brett Ryan, an economist for Deutsche Bank in New York. \u201cIt just showed up in the unemployment rate.\u201dCautious, but Still HiringEconomists have become increasingly concerned in recent months about a range of possible threats to the United States economy. Growth has slowed in Europe and China; trade tensions are threatening the American manufacturing sector; stock market jitters could make consumers less likely to spend; and the shutdown, of course, could erode confidence among consumers and businesses.None of that, however, has yet affected the job market.\u201cThere\u2019s a caution or concern in people\u2019s voices, but it hasn\u2019t turned into action,\u201d said Teresa Carroll, executive vice president for Kelly Services, a staffing firm. \u201cAnybody in a hiring situation in a company is probably waiting for that next shoe to drop, but it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re stopping.\u201dIt isn\u2019t just Friday\u2019s data that looked strong. Claims for unemployment insurance recently hit a nearly 50-year low. Paychecks are growing \u2014 data released Thursday showed that wages and salaries rose 3.1 percent in the final three months of 2018 compared with a year earlier, the fastest growth since the recession ended a decade ago. And employers report in private surveys that they plan to keep on adding workers, at least if they can find them.\u201cThe underlying foundation hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup North America, a staffing firm. She said what she was hearing from clients was \u201cnice, robust optimism continuing around hiring.\u201dAs the unemployment rate has fallen, companies have had to work harder to find workers. Ms. Frankiewicz said companies were increasingly offering training, rethinking job requirements and letting employees work remotely. They are also raising pay \u2014 a factor that may be attracting people who had previously stopped looking for work. The labor force grew by nearly half a million people in January, suggesting that more Americans are willing and able to work than the low unemployment rate might indicate.\u201cIf wages are rising, that gives a greater incentive for folks to come back into the labor force and look for jobs,\u201d Ms. Meyer of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.More Complications for PolicymakersThe Federal Reserve had signaled this week that it was pressing \u201cpause\u201d on plans to continue raising interest rates this year. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed\u2019s chairman, said that \u201cthe case for raising rates has weakened somewhat\u201d because of low inflation and slowing global growth.Friday\u2019s report seemed to offer a sharp counterpoint to those comments. The economy, at least in the United States, still seems strong, and wage growth has been picking up.Still, economists said the report was unlikely to lead the Fed to reverse course yet again. \u201cThis is just one piece of news,\u201d Mr. Ryan of Deutsche Bank said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to see several more of these before they\u2019re comfortable hiking again.\u201dFor President Trump, whose approval ratings have been battered by the shutdown, the Russia investigation and other factors, Friday\u2019s data was welcome news. Both Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the White House issued news releases highlighting the jobs figures, and the president hailed the report on Twitter."}, {"title": "Stacey Abrams and the Future of the Democratic Party", "category": "Politics", "id": "f3a636b3-fc56-4494-8736-a92f3bdbd24f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/us/politics/on-politics-stacey-abrams-sotu-response.html", "publishdate": 20190131, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/us/politics/31onpolitics-pm/31onpolitics-pm-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.[Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]Say goodbye to Steve. And say hello to Stacey.Two years ago, Democrats picked Steve Beshear to deliver the party\u2019s response to President Trump\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress. Mr. Beshear, a 72-year-old moderate former governor of Kentucky, sat in a diner in his deep-red state, surrounded by a bipartisan group of onlookers, and tried to plant seeds of regret among Trump supporters.How things have changed. On Tuesday, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, announced that the duty of giving this year\u2019s State of the Union response would fall to Stacey Abrams, the 45-year-old, progressive, African-American candidate for governor of Georgia, whose tight race (and narrow loss) electrified the party.Mr. Beshear represented exactly the demographic Democrats struggled with in the 2016 election \u2014 older, white, Southern men. The voters Ms. Abrams represents \u2014 young, diverse and female \u2014 won the party control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections.The shift from Steve to Stacey is a powerful statement for a party that has spent much of the past two years debating what, exactly, it wanted to be in the Trump era. Should the party focus on recapturing the \u201cClinton Democrats,\u201d the moderates who won them the White House during the 1990s? Or should it lean into the ascendant liberal wing, and the far more diverse, far more female coalition inspired to action by their strident opposition to Mr. Trump?Ms. Abrams\u2019s selection tells us a lot about where Democratic leaders see their future. She will be both the first nonsitting public official and the first black woman to deliver the rebuttal.The former minority leader of the Georgia House, Ms. Abrams ran on a staunchly liberal platform in her red state. She has refused to concede defeat in the race, blaming voting irregularities for her loss \u2014 a stance that has only added to her reputation among Democrats.\u201cAs a leader, I should be stoic in my outrage and silent in my rebuke,\u201d she said in her nonconcession speech. \u201cBut stoicism is a luxury and silence is a weapon for those who would quiet the voices of the people, and I will not concede because the erosion of our democracy is not right.\u201dSince losing her race, she has begun a voting rights group to challenge Republican policies, joined a liberal think tank and embarked upon a statewide \u201cthank you tour.\u201d She will even make an appearance during the Super Bowl, popping up in a 30-second ad for her organization, Fair Fight Action.Her approval rating is 15 points higher than the man who beat her, Gov. Brian Kemp, and the Democratic primary field is essentially frozen as she decides whether to challenge Senator David Perdue in 2020 \u2014 a contest national Democrats would like her to enter.\u201cWe were sitting around thinking about this three weeks ago, and her name came up,\u201d Mr. Schumer told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \u201cImmediately, everyone in the room said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201dDelivering the response to the State of the Union speech may be the most thankless job in politics \u2014 the addresses are largely remembered for what goes wrong. (See: Rubio, Marco, and his water bottle.)But for Democrats, the potential for missteps might not matter. The choice of a speaker can say more about a party than the content of the address.****It\u2019s possible this whole newsletter was really an excuse to link to this documentary-style video that Democrats produced to respond to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1985 address.

With that in mind, we wanted to update you on some of the stories we covered this month. \u2022 We brought you the story of J\u00falia Quintanilla, a contract employee cleaning federal government buildings, who worried about how she would pay her bills \u2014 or even afford groceries \u2014 during the government shutdown. The government has reopened, but Ms. Quintanilla\u2019s fight isn\u2019t over. Democratic lawmakers in the Senate are pushing a bill that would ensure low-wage workers get back pay. So far, the legislation has failed to attract any Republican co-sponsors.\u2022 Since we wrote about the former Starbucks C.E.O. Howard Schultz\u2019s difficult path to the presidency, his troubles have gone from tall to venti. Over the past three days, it has come out that Mr. Schultz has voted in just 11 of the past 38 elections. He doesn\u2019t know the price of a box of Cheerios, the country\u2019s No. 1-selling breakfast cereal. And he was heckled at a book event in New York City, with another protest planned tonight in his hometown, Seattle.\u2022 Before President Trump agreed to end the government shutdown last Friday, we wrote about how damaging the situation had become for his political standing. On Tuesday, a new Washington Post-ABC News poll found that a whopping 56 percent of Americans said they would definitely not vote for him in 2020. (Don\u2019t count him out yet, though. We are still two years away from any ballots being cast.)\u2022 For our first newsletter of 2019, we wrote about the \u201clikability\u201d question that plagues female politicians \u2014 most recently Senator Elizabeth Warren.

We\u2019re calling it The Soapbox. In today\u2019s edition, readers sound off on Howard Schultz\u2019s possible presidential run. Steve McClam of South Carolina writes:I\u2019m an \u201cactual voter\u201d described in today\u2019s Schultz article. I\u2019m independent (never belonged to either party); socially moderate/liberal and fiscally conservative, residing in a super-red state, South Carolina.I voted for Trump because I had Clinton fatigue. Now I have Trump fatigue in a big way (not to mention the embarrassment/regret factor). I feel that I have been abandoned by both parties and have nowhere to turn \u2014 until now, when Mr. Schultz showed up. There are more of us out here than you may think.Laurel Tuttle of Washington State writes:Maybe he is popular in his home state of New York, but he\u2019d have to buy his own coffee in Seattle. I cannot understand how anyone but Donald Trump could have an ego so big that he would do this, knowing how harmful it could be. I hope no one buys his book and no one goes to his rallies. He deserves no more.Seth Berkowitz of Los Angeles writes:If he wants to be president, he should run for the Democratic nomination. He\u2019s a got a year till the first caucus and a huge pile of money to fund his run. If he can\u2019t make a dent in a 20-person field with that and by being the only moderate in the race who isn\u2019t running away from his ideology, then how can he hope to be anything in the election but a spoiler?And finally, Rebecca Manning of San Francisco, a volunteer advocate for the Center for Voting and Democracy, writes:Howard Schultz is definitely not without a constituency. Third-party candidates are not to blame for the spoiler effect \u2014 it is gerrymandered single-member voting districts, state boards of elections\u2019 limitations on ballot access and winner-take-all counting methods keeping us from breaking free from our stalemated government.There are nonpartisan solutions voters need to demand from our reps. We need more choices and we need the math to stop working against us. The goal is, we reach a tipping point with those in policymaking positions respecting all viewpoints again, regardless of party or non-party affiliation. We should be encouraging more candidates to enter the race. With multi-member voting districts and ranked-choice voting, the way is open for local representation in D.C. to actually look like the diverse populations we are.If you want to share your thoughts, send us an email: onpolitics@nytimes.com.____________________What to read tonight\u2022 Think the government shutdown created uncertainty for business?

Investment in 2018 dropped 46.5 percent from the year before, according to data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a British trade association. With the Brexit debate in London and Brussels mired in disagreement and recriminations, concerns and warnings from businesses have grown louder. Uncertainty is usually bad for trade, and companies have repeatedly urged political leaders to provide clarity about the withdrawal and its likely effects on commerce.But those pleas have generally gone unanswered, and many multinational companies have said they are ready to move operations outside Britain. In its report on Thursday, the Society of Motor Manufacturers urged British lawmakers to do whatever was necessary to prevent the country from leaving the bloc without an agreement with the European Union, a so-called no-deal Brexit. In addition to the data on the drop in investment, the organization published figures that showed production had fallen to its lowest level in five years. \u201cWith fewer than 60 days before we leave the E.U., and the risk of crashing out without a deal looking increasingly real, U.K. automotive is on red alert,\u201d Mike Hawes, the organization\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cBrexit uncertainty has already done enormous damage to output, investment and jobs.\u201d \u201cBrexit is the clear and present danger and, with thousands of jobs on the line, we urge all parties to do whatever it takes to save us from \u2018no deal,\u2019\u201d he added. Negative effects on the British auto industry, which directly employs about 186,000 people, appear to have already started.Regulatory changes, uncertainty, and declining confidence among businesses and consumers hampered production for sales within Britain, the organization said. Manufacturing of vehicles for export, which represent more than 80 percent of output, dropped 7.3 percent in 2018, it added.

Automakers like Jaguar Land Rover and BMW have already said that they would briefly pause production after Britain\u2019s scheduled leaving date at the end of March, to assess and cope with any disruptions that come with life outside the European Union. The chief executive of the luxury carmaker Bentley, Adrian Hallmark, has called Brexit a \u201ckiller\u201d for his turnaround plans.And London Electric Vehicle Company, which makes black cabs and is owned by Geely of China, said on Thursday that it would cut 70 position among its agency staff in response to the uncertainty.Manufacturers in Britain have taken advantage of freedom of movement among European Union members to create just-in-time manufacturing processes that allow components to be delivered minutes before they are needed.

But he made no mention of his prior reluctance in a letter to employees on Thursday.\u201cWhen the board approached me about taking the C.E.O. role, I jumped at the opportunity to remove \u2018interim\u2019 from my title,\u201d he said.The lengthy search for a successor to Mr. Krzanich prompted speculation that Intel would pick an outsider for the first time in its 50-year history. Andy Bryant, Intel\u2019s chairman, said Thursday that the board had conducted a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d evaluation of internal and external candidates before settling on Mr. Swan. Mr. Bryant credited Mr. Swan\u2019s performance in the interim role for making the difference.\u201cWe considered many outstanding executives, and we concluded the best choice is Bob,\u201d Mr. Bryant said in prepared remarks.Although Mr. Swan is taking the helm when Intel is financially strong, it faces many questions about its future. One main cause for concern was the company\u2019s stumble in establishing a new process for producing tinier transistors on chips, a pattern of miniaturization that regularly lowers the cost of computing and storing data.Intel wound up with a shortage of some kinds of chips, particularly those used in personal computers, because production capacity meant for the new process had to be shifted back to the company\u2019s existing manufacturing technology.Intel reported last week that its revenue had increased 13 percent, to $70.8 billion, in 2018. But the company projected only slight growth for this year, amid heightened competition and uncertainty about sales in China.In his current role, Mr. Swan has stressed a strategy that would take Intel \u2014 long the dominant supplier of processors for personal computers and server systems \u2014 into larger markets where it has lagged. In his letter to employees, he said Intel needed to be more unified and to reduce its operating miscues.\u201cOur execution must improve,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd it will. Our customers are counting on us.\u201dMr. Swan, a relative newcomer to semiconductors, has plenty of experience in the technology sector. He spent nine years as eBay\u2019s chief financial officer and served as chief financial officer and chief executive of the ill-fated delivery start-up Webvan Group. Immediately before joining Intel, he served as an operating partner at the equity firm General Atlantic.Analysts said the choice of Mr. Swan suggested Intel\u2019s directors believed the company was headed in the right direction.Wall Street was probably expecting Intel\u2019s board to pick a more \u201ctransformational or visionary choice with a proven track record,\u201d Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, wrote in a research note. \u201cOur view is that Bob is a solid choice on the notion that, as a non-semiconductor guy, he can look at the big decisions ahead dispassionately.\u201dIntel\u2019s stock was down around 1 percent on Thursday.Intel also said Thursday that Todd Underwood, vice president of finance and director of corporate planning and reporting, would be interim chief financial officer as the company sought a permanent successor to Mr. Swan."}, {"title": "It\u2019s Not the Stuff of a Playful BuzzFeed Quiz", "category": "Business", "id": "f79ac8d3-b7c6-4657-a57d-5f6b8cc356e9", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/business/media/buzzfeed-layoffs.html", "publishdate": 20190131, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/business/01BUZZFEED/merlin_148026480_bcb5a1db-cc31-46ae-814b-fae452b5708f-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "\u201cDo You Still Have a Job at BuzzFeed?\u201dFor about 220 BuzzFeed employees, the answer to the question posed by that quiz, which was posted on the BuzzFeed site on Monday, is no.Managers started laying off the site\u2019s staff members last Friday, when 43 journalists at the company\u2019s news division were cut. By Wednesday, all of the employees who would be put out of work, totaling more than 15 percent of its staff, had learned their fates, with the exception of certain workers in Australia and Britain, a spokesman for the company said.The \u201cDo You Still Have a Job\u201d quiz was contributed by Jason Sweeten, who worked in the company\u2019s branded content division until a separate round of layoffs in June. \u201cI felt helpless knowing that a bunch of my friends were going to lose their jobs, so I hoped that this could bring some levity to everything,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cAlso, I assumed the quiz would be deleted immediately.\u201dIt\u2019s still on the site\u2019s Community section, which is filled with posts from contributors who have signed up for BuzzFeed Community Member accounts to publish unpaid material on the site.Since BuzzFeed\u2019s chief executive, Jonah Peretti, and its managers started delivering the bad news, the company has faced criticism for dragging out the firing process, and employees who were let go have publicly criticized their severance packages. In addition, the suddenly jobless journalists have suffered the attacks of online trolls from corners of the internet darker and colder than BuzzFeed\u2019s typically sunny climate.Complaints about severance pay started bubbling up in an internal Slack messaging channel last Friday called AJA, for \u201cAsk Jonah Anything.\u201d BuzzFeed workers \u2014 those still employed and the newly laid off \u2014 questioned why the company was not going to include pay for unused vacation and comp days as part of the exit packages (except for employees based in California, where such payment is required by law).A group of current and former employees who called themselves the BuzzFeed News Council published a letter on Medium concerning the issue of paid time off, known as P.T.O. It was signed by 600 current and former employees and addressed to Mr. Peretti; the company\u2019s chief people officer, Lenke Taylor; and the BuzzFeed News editor in chief, Ben Smith.\u201cFor many people, paying out P.T.O. will be the difference between whether or not bills and student loans will be paid on time and how their families are supported,\u201d the letter read. \u201cIt is unconscionable that BuzzFeed could justify doing so for some employees and not others in order to serve the company\u2019s bottom line.\u201dThe hosts of BuzzFeed\u2019s morning show \u201cAM to DM,\u201d which is produced in association with Twitter, addressed the issue on Monday. \u201cI think it is embarrassing and absurd to work for a company that puts such an emphasis on this idea of all of us in it together, all of us as a family, and then refusing to pay out P.T.O. \u2014 paid time off \u2014 except where it\u2019s law,\u201d Isaac Fitzgerald, a co-host, said.The pressure worked. Mr. Peretti met with the council on Monday and sent an email to employees hours later, informing them that the company would include payments for vacation and comp days as part of the severance packages.The same day, The New Yorker published a letter to the editor by Mr. Peretti. It was his response to the magazine\u2019s recent article on the state of the journalism business by the historian Jill Lepore. In the piece \u2014 whose tenor was summed up by an illustration of the Grim Reaper holding a newspaper \u2014 Ms. Lepore wrote that \u201cspeculation is that BuzzFeed is trying to dump\u201d BuzzFeed News. In his letter, Mr. Peretti wrote: \u201cThis speculation is incorrect. Whatever challenges we face in this difficult environment for digital media, BuzzFeed News remains a key part of the future of BuzzFeed.\u201dAdding to the turbulence were the public complaints of BuzzFeed\u2019s quizmaster, Matthew Perpetua, another victim of the layoffs. On Monday, Mr. Perpetua published a blog post informing readers that a number of the site\u2019s most popular quizzes were created by unpaid contributors. One so-called community user, whom he identified only as a college student in Michigan, was \u201cthe second-highest traffic driver worldwide\u201d among BuzzFeed\u2019s quizmakers, Mr. Perpetua wrote.This came as news to the quizmaker, Rachel McMahon, a 19-year-old student at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Mich. After writing on Twitter that she felt \u201chorrible\u201d that BuzzFeed may have been emboldened to lay off staff partly because of the popularity of her unpaid work, she had a moment in the media spotlight when she was interviewed at length for New York magazine\u2019s Intelligencer site.A BuzzFeed spokesman complimented Ms. McMahon\u2019s work but disputed that she was the second most popular quizmaker in 2018, adding, \u201cWe\u2019d be all too lucky to hire her when she graduates from college.\u201dOver the last week, many of the laid-off BuzzFeeders found themselves the recipients of ugly messages and tweets sent by trolls and alt-right Twitter accounts. The messages included some variation of \u201clearn to code,\u201d images of nooses and insults. One message sent by email included death threats, NBC News reported.\u201cI believe there is a special, dedicated section of Hell just for people with anime twitter avatars who tell laid-off journalists to \u2018learn to code,\u2019\u201d Patrick George, the editor in chief of the automotive site Jalopnik, said on Twitter."}, {"title": "Y.A.

Delacorte still plans to publish the three books she is under contract for, including \u201cBlood Heir\u201d if Ms. Zhao decides she wants to release it at a later time, according to a company spokeswoman.\u201cWe respect Amelie\u2019s decision, and look forward to continuing our publishing relationship with her,\u201d Random House Children\u2019s Books, Delacorte\u2019s parent company, said in a statement. Ms. Zhao was unavailable for an interview, according to her publisher.The controversy surrounding \u201cBlood Heir,\u201d and Ms. Zhao\u2019s swift and dramatic decision to withdraw the work just months before publication, has further fueled a skirmish in the world of young adult literature over racial representation, diversity and cultural appropriation.The debate over Ms. Zhao\u2019s novel echoes previous scandals that have erupted in recent years over representation in children\u2019s and young adult books, as publishers have had to delay, cancel and even withdraw and pulp books that became lightning rods for online criticism.In 2016, a picture book titled \u201cA Birthday Cake for George Washington\u201d was withdrawn from stores after critics complained that it glossed over the horrors of slavery. A similar scandal engulfed the 2015 picture book \u201cA Fine Dessert,\u201d which depicted an enslaved mother and daughter hiding in a cupboard and cheerfully licking a bowl of batter clean; the author, Emily Jenkins, apologized and donated her earnings to We Need Diverse Books, a nonprofit that promotes diversity in children\u2019s publishing. In 2017, Laura Moriarty\u2019s dystopian novel, \u201cAmerican Heart,\u201d was savaged, months before its release, by readers who said Ms. Moriarty had peddled a \u201cwhite savior narrative\u201d in her depiction of a future America where Muslims are placed in internment camps. Harlequin Teen delayed publication of Keira Drake\u2019s fantasy novel, \u201cThe Continent,\u201d after readers blasted it as \u201cracist trash,\u201d \u201cretrograde\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d Ms. Drake and her publisher, Harlequin Teen, apologized, and Ms. Drake rewrote the book, removing and revising some passages and character descriptions that readers had flagged as racially offensive.Children\u2019s book publishers have grown increasingly cautious when acquiring books that deal with charged subjects such as race, gender, sexuality and disability. Many publishers and authors now hire \u201csensitivity readers\u201d who vet books and identify harmful stereotypes.\u201cWhen any author is writing outside their own experience, we want to make sure they\u2019ve done their homework,\u201d David Levithan, vice president and publisher of Scholastic Press, which regularly seeks advice from sensitivity readers, told The Times in 2017.[Read about the growing trend of sensitivity readers.]Edith Campbell, a reference librarian at Indiana State University who blogs about young adult literature, said readers\u2019 ability to instantly weigh in on social media has forced publishers to confront the lack of diversity in the industry, and made it impossible for publishers and authors to ignore complaints when a book promulgates racial or other stereotypes.\u201cThis is one of the few ways that publishing has evolved into the 21st century, by having to listen to people\u2019s immediate reaction to what they\u2019re publishing,\u201d she said.Shelley Diaz, a former reviews manager and young adult editor at School Library Journal, said \u201cBlood Heir\u201d and other young adult fantasy novels that deal with slavery often deserve extra scrutiny from readers because the stories are crafted for an impressionable young audience, and praised Ms. Zhao for responding to critics.\u201cSome people in the community have found things that were worthy of critique and weren\u2019t handled in a culturally competent way,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of authors have been confronted with critiques like these and decided to stand their ground and not change anything, but this was a woman of color who was brave enough to say, \u2018I hear you, I hear this critique, and I want to bring a better book out to my readers.\u2019\u201dBut some argue that in our hyperreactive online ecosystem, where a tweet or a negative blog post can quickly spark mass calls for a book\u2019s cancellation or a boycott against a publisher, the outrage cycle is often overblown, and can have devastating consequences for young adult authors who are just starting their careers.Ms. Zhao, who was born in Paris and raised in a multicultural community in Beijing, and emigrated from China when she was 18, had dreamed of becoming a writer since she was in elementary school, according to her website. Her mother warned her it was impractical, so she pursued a career in finance while writing on the side.On her website, she described how \u201cBlood Heir,\u201d which takes place in a fictional Cyrilian empire where a group of powerful people called Affinites are feared and enslaved, drew on real-world issues, including \u201cthe demonization of the Other and this experience of not belonging.\u201d\u201cAs a foreigner in Trump\u2019s America, I\u2019ve been called names and faced unpleasant remarks \u2014 and as a non-citizen, I\u2019ve felt like I have no voice \u2014 which is why I\u2019ve channeled my anger, my frustration, and my need for action into the most powerful weapon I have: my words,\u201d she wrote on her website.When Ms. Zhao\u2019s agent, Pete Knapp, submitted the manuscript to publishers, editors swooned. Offers poured in from the five biggest publishing houses, and Ms. Zhao sold the book as part of a three-book package to Delacorte Press for more than $500,000, according to the industry website Publishers Marketplace. Delacorte described it in marketing copy as \u201cthe hottest fantasy debut of the summer,\u201d calling it an \u201cepic new series about a princess hiding a dark secret and the conman she must trust to clear her name for her father\u2019s murder.\u201dAfter Delacorte sent out advance reader copies, many of the early reviews were positive \u2014 the book has a four and a half star rating on Goodreads. But a backlash began brewing this January, when some readers posted blistering critiques on social media. Some readers criticized what they viewed as racial stereotypes and careless borrowing from other cultural traditions: the novel features a diverse cast \u2014 including \u201ca tawny-skinned minority of a Russian-esque princess; a disowned and dishonored Asian-esque assassin; an islander/Caribbean-esque child warrior; a Middle-Eastern-esque soldier,\u201d according to Ms. Zhao\u2019s description of the novel on her website.Others objected to the way in which Ms. Zhao used slavery as a plot device.\u201cHow is nobody mentioning the anti-blackness and blatant bigotry in this book?\u201d one reader wrote on Goodreads. \u201cThis book is about slavery, a false oppression narrative that equates having legitimately dangerous magical powers that kill people with being an oppressed minority, like a person of color. This whole story is absolutely repulsive.\u201dWith what seemed like lightning speed in the publishing world, where publicity and marketing plans are crafted months in advance, Ms. Zhao apologized and said she would withdraw the book, which was due out in early June.In a note to readers, she said she intended to write the novel from her \u201cimmediate cultural perspective\u201d and to address the \u201cepidemic of indentured and human trafficking prevalent in many industries across Asia, including in my own home country. The narrative and history of slavery in the United States is not something I can, would or intended to write, but I recognize that I am not writing in merely my own cultural context. I am so sorry for the pain this has caused.\u201dRather than calming the social media firestorm surrounding her book, Ms. Zhao\u2019s decision set off another fractious debate about whether she was right to listen to her critics, or whether she had been bullied into scrapping her hard work by an online mob of competitive, backstabbing writers.\u201cYA Twitter remains a cancerous stain on social media and in life. Woke white women mostly along with \u2018concerned\u2019 minority women cyber bully a debuting Chinese author Am\u00e9lie Wen Zhao to NOT publish her book,\u201d one observer wrote on Twitter.Others praised her for pulling the book.\u201cI\u2019m so glad to hear that you\u2019re taking the concerns that were raised seriously and trying to do better instead of getting defensive,\u201d a book blogger wrote on Twitter."}, {"title": "Italy Slides Into Recession as Europe Stalls, Stoking Global Fears", "category": "Business", "id": "587de15f-9adb-4bed-b051-7529cf8741d6", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/business/italy-recession-europe-slowdown.html", "publishdate": 20190131, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/business/01ITALYECON-1/merlin_146611383_ab637bcc-1efb-4eb7-ae19-0726383576c5-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Italy has officially slipped into recession, and Europe as a whole is essentially at an economic standstill, raising anxieties that the world is on the verge of a significant slowdown.The timing could not be worse. The lousy performance of the Italian economy, reported on Thursday, is likely to aggravate relations between the European Commission and Italy\u2019s populist government, which has pursued spending policies widely regarded as irresponsible. Leaders on the Continent are already dealing with Britain\u2019s messy exit from the European Union.At the same time, China\u2019s economy is slowing, in part because of President Trump\u2019s trade war. The data published Thursday by official statistics agencies provided a glimpse of just how intertwined China and Europe have become, and how vulnerable that leaves the eurozone. This weakness, in turn, adds to risks facing the United States, which is Europe\u2019s top trading partner.In Italy, the government\u2019s debt load is one of the highest in the world. A prolonged economic slump would significantly add to the risk of default, with global repercussions.The European Central Bank has in the past come to the rescue of Europe, and Italy in particular, but it has less scope to do so now. The bank is scaling back its purchases of government bonds, a stimulus measure that helped ensure there were buyers for Italian government debt.\u201cWe have weaker economic momentum and at the same time the E.C.B. is getting out of the market,\u201d said Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl, an economist at German insurer Allianz. \u201cThat means there is less room for policy mistakes.\u201dGiuseppe Conte, the Italian prime minister, hardly reassured his European partners when he said Thursday that the economic setback had nothing to do with his government.ImageA menswear plant in Mantova, Italy. For the second straight quarter, economic growth was negative in Italy, the mark of a recession. It is Italy\u2019s third since 2008.CreditGianni Cipriano for The New York Times\u201cI am not worried in the least,\u201d Mr. Conte told reporters, calling the recession \u201ctemporary\u201d and blaming a tariff war between the United States and China that had hurt Italy\u2019s No. 1 trading partner, Germany, and \u201cwill find us all losers.\u201dThe Italian economy shrank 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the third quarter, Istat, the Italian statistics agency, said. It was the second quarter in a row of declining output and that, by one common definition, means a recession. It is Italy\u2019s third since 2008.Growth in the eurozone itself was just 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, the European Union statistics agency said. That rate matched the previous quarter\u2019s, and anemic as it is, it might have been worse but for Spain and France. Spain\u2019s economy grew at an unexpectedly strong clip, rising 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the third. And in France, where the government has been struggling with mass public protests over economic duress, growth hit 0.3 percent.Economists agree with Mr. Conte on one point \u2014 that China\u2019s woes are weighing on Europe.During the last decade, Europe profited from China\u2019s push to modernize its infrastructure. China equals the United States as a customer for heavy-duty German machinery, like cranes, textile machines or equipment for steel mills, and companies like Volkswagen have made the country a priority.\u201cIt\u2019s our biggest market,\u201d said Ralph Wiechers, chief economist at the Mechanical Engineering Industry Association, which represents German machine manufacturers. \u201cWe still have growth, but we are noticing a lack of momentum.\u201dCritics of the Italian government blame its economic policies at home for its performance. Economists say the populist alliance has sowed uncertainty, prompting many Italians to spend less. A decline in consumer spending was a major culprit in the economy\u2019s setback.Carlo Cottarelli, a former director of the International Monetary Fund who led a spending review of the previous Italian government, reviewed the statistics on Thursday and said the alliance, in power since June, was responsible for Italy\u2019s slide. \u201cThis recession here, it can\u2019t be the fault of the previous government,\u201d he told a radio station in Padua.After a protracted fight last year with Brussels, Italy\u2019s government increased spending for broader welfare programs and generous pensions. The government, pulling together its first budget, assured Europe that its growth would be much higher than estimated by experts \u2014 although it blocked major infrastructure projects that could stimulate growth.ImageAn installation by the Italian street artist Maupa. The lousy performance of the Italian economy is likely to aggravate relations between the European Commission and Italy\u2019s populist government.CreditFilippo Monteforte/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesItalian business leaders have become bolder in their criticism, as seen Wednesday when Mr. Conte hinted to a powerful business association in the northern Lombardy region that the new economic figures might disappoint.Carlo Bonomi, the group\u2019s president, implored the prime minister to stop governing from the \u201ceasy street\u201d of electoral politics, and to introduce responsible economic policies. \u201cStop this drift towards violence and hate, also rhetorical, that is starting to rend the fabric of Italian society,\u201d Mr. Bonomi said, in remarks broadcast on television news and in press reports.After the statistics of a new recession became official, the criticism spread.\u201cWe need to immediately open the construction sites,\u201d Vincenzo Boccia, president of the Confindustria business association, told reporters on Thursday. He added: \u201cWe need to react as soon as possible, so that we can compensate the external effect from the global economy.\u201dSome analysts said that economic pain could be the only way to break the spell cast by Italian populists. But others warned that a struggling economy helped set the conditions that fueled the extreme parties\u2019 rise.On Thursday, the Italian government wasted no time in blaming someone else, in this case, its predecessors.\u201cToday\u2019s data from Istat show a fundamental thing, that those who were in government before us lied to us,\u201d said Luigi Di Maio, the political leader of the Five Star Movement and Italy\u2019s economic development minister, speaking at a party event. \u201cThey never got us out of the crisis.\u201dHe predicted that government initiatives, including an expensive unemployment program, would soon increase employment.Mr. Conte was similarly sanguine. \u201cWe need to focus on relaunching our economy and that will surely happen in 2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be realized mostly in the second semester of 2019, and there is a lot of enthusiasm about that.\u201d"}, {"title": "After Burst of Holiday Spending, a Plan for a \u2018Frugal February\u2019", "category": "Business", "id": "84b3d084-e590-4d89-8458-585c0d97ce8a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/your-money/holiday-spending-frugal-february.html", "publishdate": 20190201, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/02/business/02Adviser/merlin_150056955_58dff5ac-8a31-417f-8abb-7640fe97f7f6-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "It\u2019s bitterly cold, and holiday bills have drained your bank account. Time for \u201cFrugal February,\u201d when splurging on restaurant meals is out and saving money by dining on home-cooked fare is in.A prime reason to observe Frugal February, personal finance experts say, is that consumers tend to overspend during the December holidays and need time for their finances to catch up.Casey Finn, a blogger in Chicago, said she and her husband, Michael, had adopted the tradition of belt-tightening in February several years ago, when they were engaged and worried about paying for a honeymoon trip. It worked so well \u2014 they saved a four-figure sum \u2014 that they kept it up and now share their penny-pinching activities online.February works well for a financial reboot for many reasons, said Ms. Finn, one of the writers of the DIY Playbook. Because February has just 28 days, any feeling of deprivation is relatively short-lived. And it is, of course, quite cold in many parts of the country (it was a bone-chilling minus 24 degrees in Chicago on Wednesday), so people often prefer to stay home anyway.Cutting back on nonessential spending in February can help people pay down credit card balances or replenish savings. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of not buying things we don\u2019t need,\u201d said Lynn Ballou, a certified financial planner and \u201cambassador\u201d for the Certified Financial Planners Board of Standards.Credit card debt has been mushrooming, and that trend continued in November, when revolving debt \u2014 mostly credit card debt \u2014 increased by 5.5 percent to $1.042 trillion, according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve. (Statistics for December are scheduled to be reported in February.)Many credit card users carry a balance on their cards from month to month, according to the American Bankers Association. That means they\u2019re probably paying double-digit interest rates: The average credit card rate is more than 14 percent, according to the website CompareCards, and the average rate for new card offers is nearly 17 percent.The heavy use of credit during good economic times suggests that consumers aren\u2019t putting away extra cash to build up emergency funds for when things slow down, said Matt Schulz, chief industry analyst at CompareCards.\u201cAmericans need to focus on paying down their credit cards\u201d and other debt in 2019, he said.The notion of cutting back on spending during the second month of the year has been around for a while. Now, the ability to share February savings strategies with others via social media can help engage people in the effort, said Kimberly Palmer, a personal finance expert with the website NerdWallet.\u201cIt\u2019s fun, rather than a struggle,\u201d she said.Ms. Finn said that while cutting back on nonessentials might sound dull, \u201cit\u2019s all about getting creative.\u201d Last year, the Winter Olympics were on television in February, so the couple watched at home and played games like \u201ccountertop curling,\u201d using ice cubes.Ms. Finn and her husband enjoy meeting friends for drinks, but the cost of such outings can quickly add up. So in February, she said, instead of meeting a friend for a glass of wine after work, she may propose heading to a gym. They can catch up while burning calories instead of cash.The month can also be a time to rediscover entertainment options in your home, Ms. Finn said, whether they are movies, books or board games. \u201cWe use the time to appreciate what we already have,\u201d she said.Here are some questions and answers about a post-holiday financial reboot:Does transferring a credit card balance to a zero-rate card make sense?If you have good credit, you can consider transferring your balance to a new card with an introductory zero percent interest offer and pay the bill off over time \u2014 sometimes, a year or longer. Look for a card with no or low transfer fees, and be sure you can pay off the balance in the allotted time. Otherwise, you\u2019ll end up paying stiff rates again, when the zero percent period ends.Another option, if you have a record of on-time payments with your existing card, is to contact its issuer and see if you can negotiate a lower interest rate, said Bruce McClary, a spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.Nick Holeman, a certified financial planner with the online financial adviser Betterment, suggests considering the larger picture when paying off card debt. After paying at least the minimum amount due on your cards, he said, you should next contribute enough to your 401(k), if you have one, to get your employer\u2019s matching contribution, if offered. Then, he said, focus on paying off any high-interest debt \u2014 generally, anything over 6 percent, including remaining credit card debt.What\u2019s the best approach to paying down credit card debt?One popular strategy is to pay off the card with the smallest balance first, to achieve results quickly and build momentum. Another approach, which Ms. Palmer of NerdWallet suggests, is paying off the cards with the highest interest rates first, since that saves the most money.What if I\u2019m planning to use my tax refund to pay down bills?Tax refunds often provide a lump sum that consumers can use to pay down debt. This year, there\u2019s concern that refunds may be delayed as a result of the government shutdown, which ended just before tax-filing season. Mandi Matlock, a lawyer and tax expert affiliated with the National Consumer Law Center, cautions consumers against taking on new obligations or making big purchases until they have their refund in hand.Some for-profit tax preparers are promoting special loans to tide filers over, but be sure you understand the terms being offered, she warned. In some cases, the loans carry hefty interest rates, which will eat into your refund."}, {"title": "Amazon\u2019s Sales Growth Slows, Even as Cloud Business Stays Hot", "category": "Business", "id": "7c5f87b5-cdfc-449e-b035-7445adccb17c", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/technology/amazon-earnings-sales-cloud.html", "publishdate": 20190201, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/business/01amazon/merlin_145496019_761e6956-3704-48f9-acab-fdc47e679d56-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SEATTLE \u2014 Amazon held off stiffer competition for online shoppers during the holiday season, once again increasing its sales. But the company said on Thursday that growth slowed from its usual breakneck pace \u2014 and it came at a cost, with the company spending far more on shipping to win customers.While strong, the latest quarterly results suggested that Amazon\u2019s retail business not only faces more competition, it is also maturing. The company reported that its revenue from retail sales and services grew 17 percent to almost $65 billion globally, while its shipping costs rose 23 percent, to $9 billion, compared with the same quarter a year ago.The company is compensating for slowing growth in e-commerce by expanding its fast-moving, highly profitable cloud and advertising businesses. Over all, the company produced a profit of $3 billion in the quarter, up more than 60 percent from the same period a year earlier.Competition for shoppers over the holidays was intense and expensive, as other big retailers stepped up their promotions. Target offered free two-day shipping, no matter how small an order, and Walmart and others tried to maximize use of their physical stores, an advantage they have over Amazon. On Christmas Eve, Best Buy customers could order products online from store inventory as late as 5 p.m. and pick them up just an hour later.Amazon pushed back with expanded free shipping to all customers until about a week before Christmas, and made more products eligible for free one-day shipping for Prime members.But revenue from online shopping slowed, in part because now most of Amazon\u2019s retail sales come from third-party merchants selling on its marketplace rather than from Amazon\u2019s own inventory. Amazon gets only a slice of this revenue.In addition, the growth of Prime membership, which costs $119 a year, is approaching a plateau. About 56 percent of American households will be Prime members this year, up only slightly from 53 percent in 2018, Morgan Stanley estimated. Prime members spend far more on the site, making them crucial to increasing sales.Another risk awaits the company: India. The country, which Amazon has made its most important emerging market, imposed new regulations that prohibit foreign e-commerce companies from owning a stake in sellers that offer items on their sites. That has limited the selection available on Amazon by almost a third virtually overnight. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s finance chief, cited \u201cuncertainty\u201d in India as a reason Amazon predicted lower revenue for the next quarter than analysts had expected.Even as sales growth has slowed, though, Amazon has increased profit margins.The third-party merchant business, for example, is generally more profitable than when Amazon sells products it buys directly because the costs are lower.It has also tried to squeeze costs from its operations. Mr. Olsavsky pointed to how the number of employees grew 38 percent in 2017, excluding acquisitions, but just 14 percent in 2018. There were similar trends in the construction of data centers and warehouses. \u201cWe had a banking, if you will, of some large expansions in the prior two years,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said on a call with analysts.\u201cThe theme has been Amazon shifting from a product seller to a fee collector,\u201d said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Instinet. The shift from growth to profit is common as companies mature, he said: \u201cWe are going through growing pains.\u201dShares in the company fell nearly 5 percent in after-hours trading, after the quarterly results were released.Amazon\u2019s two great profit engines are not in the core business of selling and fulfilling items, however \u2014 they are in cloud computing and advertising.Amazon Web Services, the leading provider of cloud computing, grew 45 percent, with $7.4 billion in sales and almost $2.2 billion in operating income.After several years of dominating the market, which it essentially helped create, Amazon now faces robust competition, including from Microsoft. At its annual cloud conference in November, Amazon announced a number of new products, including AWS Outposts, which lets companies use a single set of tools to manage data across cloud and local servers, an area known as \u201chybrid cloud\u201d where Microsoft has had success.Mr. Olsavsky said the company had been hiring aggressively to bring in more engineers and sales staff for the cloud offerings, saying \u201cAWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continued to deliver for customers.\u201dInvestors have increasingly looked to Amazon\u2019s ad business, which displays ads on its own site as well as across the web based on consumer shopping habits, as a major driver of profit. The \u201cOther\u201d business unit, which analysts say is almost entirely advertising, had almost $3.4 billion in revenue during the quarter, and more than $10 billion over the last year.\u201cThey have long been a sleeping giant and had capacity to build a big advertising business,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group."}, {"title": "Trump\u2019s Campaign Spent Heavily as He Hit the Midterm Trail", "category": "Politics", "id": "38059544-9a47-498c-a522-c411d4f30a9a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign-spending.html", "publishdate": 20190201, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/us/politics/01fec/merlin_146394726_22d1ae05-e574-46ed-bbaa-90ed27d07a2e-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "As Democratic candidates begin to file their paperwork to run for president in 2020, they already know they will be facing a well-financed opponent. President Trump\u2019s campaign reported $19.2 million in cash on hand Thursday in a filing with the Federal Election Commission.The campaign\u2019s three committees reported raising $21 million in the final three months of 2018. That number is on pace with previous quarters last year. And as in previous reports, the campaign relied heavily on donors giving less than $200, raising three out of every four dollars from small donors.The president\u2019s brisk small-money fund-raising contrasts with the performance of many Republican congressional candidates during the midterm elections, who relied more heavily on donors giving larger amounts as they struggled to keep pace with their Democratic opponents\u2019 fund-raising.Some Republicans grumbled that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign vacuumed up donations that could have been used more effectively in the midterms by House candidates trying to retain their seats. The Democrats gained 40 House seats.Mr. Trump did campaign aggressively for Republican congressional candidates, and his campaign finance reports reflect that, showing increased spending in the final quarter of 2018. The Trump campaign spent $23 million in the last three months of the year, including $8 million on television and online media, and more than $1.5 million on expenses associated with his rallies.It also spent nearly $180,000 on rent at Trump Tower and expenses at other Trump properties. And it continued to spend big on merchandise, shelling out $2.4 million on T-shirts, banners, buttons, stickers and, of course, hats.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign spent $838,000 on legal fees in the fourth quarter, including payments to two firms that have represented the president and his associates in matters related to investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. The firm of Marc E. Kasowitz, a longtime lawyer for Mr. Trump in New York, was paid $323,000, while Jones Day, which also handles the campaign\u2019s election law compliance, was paid $188,000.More than $100,000 was paid to LaRocca Hornik Rosen Greenberg & Blaha L.L.P., which is representing the president in a lawsuit brought by protesters who claim they were roughed up by Mr. Trump\u2019s security personnel outside of Trump Tower in September 2015.Separate from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, a fund created to help pay legal bills for his campaign, transition and administration employees and consultants, Patriot Legal Expense Fund Trust L.L.C., raised $500,000 in the fourth quarter of last year, according to an Internal Revenue Service filing. It showed that all of the money came from the Las Vegas casino owner Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam Adelson.None of the prominent Democrats running or expected to run in 2020 filed presidential fund-raising numbers Thursday, but some who are currently holding another office reported substantial sums of cash that they will be able to transfer to a presidential run. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who has declared her intent to seek the presidency, closed the year with more than $11 million in her Senate campaign account, and New York\u2019s junior senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, finished the year with $10 million.Senator Kamala Harris of California, who unlike Ms. Warren and Ms. Gillibrand was not up for re-election in 2018, trailed with just over $1 million in cash."}, {"title": "As Pelvic Mesh Settlements Near $8 Billion, Women Question Lawyers\u2019 Fees", "category": "Business", "id": "553f6619-873f-48a6-8b16-6353439d32e4", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/pelvic-mesh-settlements-lawyers.html", "publishdate": 20190201, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/02/business/02JPMESH-print/24MESH-01-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "When Sherise Grant filed a claim against the manufacturer of her pelvic mesh implant, she hoped to use the money from a settlement to pay for its removal.Ms. Grant, 51, was among the millions of women around the globe whose urinary problems were treated with pelvic mesh. But not only has the surgically implanted device done little to help her, it frequently causes Ms. Grant discomfort, including pain during sex with her husband.But the settlement wasn\u2019t enough. After lawyers\u2019 fees and other expenses, the $12,000 payout was whittled away to only $3,500.Ms. Grant said she had called her lawyer\u2019s office to discuss those fees, and gotten nowhere. \u201cThey won\u2019t let me talk to the attorney,\u201d said Ms. Grant, of Hemet, Calif. \u201cI just want everything to be fair. I think they took way more than they should have.\u201dLitigation over pelvic mesh, also called transvaginal mesh, ranks as one of the biggest mass tort cases in United States history, in terms of claims filed, number of corporate defendants and settlement dollars. Seven medical device manufacturers, including Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson, are paying nearly $8 billion to resolve the claims of more than 100,000 women.A decade ago, doctors were quick to implant synthetic mesh to deal with health issues caused by a woman\u2019s bladder pressing against her vagina. But then women began complaining of complications like bleeding and searing pain. Lawyers aggressively advertised for women who had received mesh implants, and they signed up women by the thousands to file claims against the device manufacturers.The result is a supersized federal court litigation that hasn\u2019t paid off as expected \u2014 the average settlement is less than $60,000, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times and interviews with more than a dozen women. That is less than settlements reached in other mass torts, even though the jury verdicts some women have won in pelvic mesh cases suggest the figure should be higher.And those settlements are worth a lot less after the lawyers take their shares and other fees \u2014 cuts that became unusually hefty even for the world of mass tort litigation.Retainer agreements and confidential documents permit some lawyers to take 40 percent of each settlement, and in some cases 45 percent. And generous expense provisions allow some firms to add costs not only for meals and hotel stays but travel by private plane. Some lawyers have found yet another way to pad their bottom lines: Hire companies they have a financial interest in to review a client\u2019s medical records, a crucial part of assessing the potential value of a claim.Now some women are considering suing their lawyers over how their cases were handled. Lawyers have begun scouting for women willing to sue, and a Dallas firm has set up a website seeking women who feel their lawyers didn\u2019t drive a hard enough bargain.\u201cEight billion dollars sounds like a lot in theory, but once you start divvying it up, it\u2019s less so,\u201d said Elizabeth Burch, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law who specializes in studying mass tort litigation and is surveying women for their views on the litigation to be used in a study.Lawyers in the mesh litigation defended their work. They said women with more severe injuries, which required the mesh to be removed in sometimes risky procedures, received the most money.\u201cWe did everything possible to get as many cases to trial as possible,\u201d said Clayton Clark, a partner with Clark Love & Hutson, which settled thousands of complaints and was involved in a half-dozen jury trials. \u201cYou see these giant verdicts in a number of places, and that sort of skews the thought process.\u201dMr. Clark, whose firm used a retainer agreement that gives it the right to \u201clease private aircrafts\u201d and employ a medical records review firm it had an ownership stake in, said the expenses charged to clients were fair. He said the fees were fully disclosed and generally reviewed by a special master working for the court.The medical records review firm was not profitable and has since closed, Mr. Clark added. \u201cThere was no potential for double-dipping,\u201d he said.Pelvic mesh litigation began in earnest in 2011, the year the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about complications with some products. Studies have shown at least 15 percent of women who had mesh implants encountered problems, and more are expected to develop them in coming years. The F.D.A. is continuing to evaluate the situation and is scheduled to hold a hearing on Feb. 12 on the \u201crisks and benefits\u201d of pelvic mesh. Though the device has not been banned, some manufacturers have removed versions of it from the market.Settlement details are often kept confidential by gag orders, but some women have spoken out about the offers they received.Michelle Hedgcoth, 43, who received her settlement in 2014, said she was fortunate that her $140,000 payout was at the higher end of the scale. But she said the implant and the surgery to remove it left her with permanent injuries and a compromised immune system because parts of the mesh are \u201cembedded\u201d in her body.Ms. Hedgcoth, who lives in Manteca, Calif., with her husband and two teenage children, said that after fees and expenses, she had received about $50,000.\u201cThe money we are being offered is not enough for the rest of our lives,\u201d said Ms. Hedgcoth, who had to leave her job at a bill collecting company because of her injuries. She is now on disability.Mass tort litigations can be difficult to compare. The complications experienced by patients can vary, and so can their outcomes at trial. But the mesh settlements are notable because of their size relative to the awards granted by juries, lawyers and experts said.To date, 32 women have gone to trial in state or federal court, and 24 have obtained verdicts against mesh manufacturers totaling $345 million, for an average award of $14 million, according to court filings.Ms. Burch said a 40 percent fee \u2014 at the high end of personal injury fees \u2014 might be justified for those cases, which went to trial and yielded multimillion-dollar verdicts. But for simply settling cases, that rate is on the high side, she said.The settlement a decade ago over complications associated with the pain medication Vioxx is a good measuring stick, Ms. Burch said. Merck, the drug\u2019s manufacturer, created a nearly $5 billion fund, which gave an average award of $147,000 to more than 30,000 litigants. The judge in that case capped the legal fees at 32 percent.And higher fees are coming out of smaller settlements: Compared with other medical device settlements, the $60,000 average for mesh cases is on the low end. In 2015, Biomet paid an average of about $79,000 to settle just under 2,000 claims from people who had faulty hip implants, according to court filings. Six years ago, Johnson & Johnson settled claims arising from its flawed hip implant product for $2.5 billion \u2014 or roughly $250,000 a person.In one pelvic mesh agreement between Boston Scientific and 3,400 women, the average payout before fees was $53,000, documents show. Just 800 had offers of $100,000 or more, while roughly half received offers of $13,000 or less. And in a $244.7 million settlement negotiated last year between Johnson & Johnson and 4,000 women, the average offer was $59,000, according to court documents.Henry Garrard, a lawyer with Blasingame, Burch, Garrard & Ashley, an Athens, Ga., law firm that handled both trials and settlements and another firm that sometimes uses a private plane, said focusing on average settlements was \u201cmisleading\u201d and ignored all the work the lawyers had done. Women who did not have the mesh removed got smaller offers because their injuries were less severe, he said.Settlements in mesh cases have tended to be negotiated for a few thousand women at a time, as opposed to one big global deal. Most of the bulk settlements have played out in federal court under the supervision of a judge in West Virginia.One lawyer who both took cases to trial and handled settlements said he believed many lawyers who settled cases in federal court took on too many clients to properly investigate their claims and push for adequate settlements.\u201cNever in the field of mass tort litigation has there been such a yawning gap between success in the courtroom and failure at the settlement table,\u201d said Shanin Specter, whose Philadelphia firm, Kline & Specter, has won more than $140 million in jury verdicts in mesh cases.On Thursday, Mr. Specter\u2019s firm scored one of its biggest courtroom victories yet \u2014 a $41 million verdict against Johnson & Johnson.Mr. Specter said he had settled about 1,500 cases at an average of $75,000, and estimated the average settlement reached in the federal court cases was closer to $40,000.Given what he called the \u201cpuny\u201d size of those settlements, Mr. Specter argued in court filings that lawyers should take less in so-called common benefit fees \u2014 up to 5 percent of the $8 billion that will be shared among the firms that did the most work on the federal litigation. But Judge Joseph Goodwin of Federal District Court in Charleston, W.Va., rejected that argument on Wednesday and approved the 5 percent fee request.That pool of money \u2014 roughly $366 million \u2014 was taken out of the settlements before final checks are cut to clients, and will be split among nearly 100 firms in addition to the fees the clients paid directly.Some law firms getting a big piece of the common benefit fund have said they will reduce the average fee they are charging individual clients to 36 percent. But that rate is still higher than the cap in the Vioxx case.Ms. Burch, the professor surveying women involved in the cases, said some had told her that they felt pressured to accept a settlement and were not aware they could pursue their own lawsuits instead.Barbara Shepard, 53, is considering doing just that.She rejected a $100,000 offer because, she said, she would have been left with almost nothing after deducting lawyers\u2019 fees and repaying the high-interest loan she took out to cover a mesh removal operation.Ms. Shepard, who lives in Bradenton, Fla., and drives a school bus, said that her loan carried an interest rate of about 50 percent, and that she would owe $69,000 to the finance firm. She is considering suing the device manufacturer and replacing her lawyers.\u201cThe mesh didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d said Ms. Shepard, who had mesh implanted to treat frequent urination. \u201cGetting the mesh out has made it worse.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: Trump May Leave Tariffs on China in Place", "category": "Business", "id": "1960418a-2a76-4e1b-bcc7-4ca704d22693", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/dealbook/trump-us-china-trade-deal.html", "publishdate": 20190201, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/02/business/02db-trump/merlin_150032736_280da6e3-9b4d-4736-bbb1-3aa10e356756-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Friday morning.

Mr. Trump said that summit meeting would happen \u201cin the near future\u201d and that it would address \u201csome of the long standing and more difficult points.\u201d According to Myron Brilliant, the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \u201cwe are in the fifth inning of a nine-inning game.\u201d He also used another sports analogy to describe the negotiations:I would now say we are at halftime of the Super Bowl of trade relations.____________________________Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________A reminder to Facebook and Google: Don\u2019t mess with AppleFacebook\u2019s 35,000 employees got a reminder this week of Apple\u2019s power over their day-to-day routines. So did workers at Google.After Facebook and Google ran afoul of Apple\u2019s rules for distributing apps, Apple hit back by blocking the two Silicon Valley giants from using the internal apps and updates that run on iPhone software.Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, told the NYT that the offending app had not been a secret and had operated with users\u2019 consent. Apple eventually restored access for both Facebook and Google, but its point had been made: Cross us at your peril.The tension with Apple was not Facebook\u2019s only concern.\u2022 The social network, in a collaboration with Twitter, said that other countries appeared to be following the Russian playbook for using social media to disseminate propaganda and disinformation. One campaign, from Iran, touched on the conflict in Syria and conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Facebook said it had removed 783 pages, groups and accounts with ties to Iran, while Twitter said it had taken down more than 2,000 accounts.\u2022 Facebook, already being investigated by the authorities in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, is also said to be the target of several more inquiries, including in Connecticut, Illinois and Pennsylvania, over its mishandling of user data.A Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank merger seems increasingly likelyDeutsche has been in a lot of trouble for a very long time. Now, it\u2019s looking increasingly probable that the German government will step in to combine it with its smaller, but also struggling competitor, Commerzbank.Deutsche reported its first full-year net profit since 2014 today but still failed to meet analysts\u2019 expectations. Its fourth quarter showed continued weakness.The bank has lurched through various failed restructuring efforts, has been hit with fine after fine and was recently raided by prosecutors pursuing a money-laundering investigation. Its stock price has more than halved in the past year. If it is unable to recover on its own, it is thought a merger with Commerzbank may occur by midyear.But that may not be wise, writes Elisa Martinuzzi of Bloomberg:The deal looks like the option of last resort. Combining two of Europe\u2019s most inefficient banks to create an even bigger supertanker would require tens of thousands of job cuts and a risky (read costly) integration to stand a chance of working.Expect ambiguity in the jobs dataThe Labor Department will release its monthly estimate of hiring and unemployment at 8:30 a.m. But there\u2019s even more uncertainty than usual, writes the NYT\u2019s Ben Casselman. Here\u2019s what to look for:Crucial time: The United States\u2019 decade-long expansion could be nearing its end, and the partial government shutdown has added to those fears. Not all the effects will show up in the jobs data, but they will make the report unusually hard to interpret.Potential impact: There is one place the shutdown will probably show up: the jobless rate. Unemployment could go up by one- or two-tenths of a percentage point.Solid foundation: The job market is strong, however. Claims for unemployment insurance recently hit a nearly 50-year low, and paychecks are growing.ImageSwitch consoles at a trade fair for video games in Paris in October.CreditBenoit Tessier/ReutersEarnings reports show looming challengesInvestors looked to earnings reports yesterday from two bellwethers of the U.S. economy: Amazon and General Electric. Both seem to be struggling with growing pains.Stiff competition: The latest quarterly results suggested that Amazon\u2019s retail business not only faced more competition, it was also maturing, as growth slowed from its usual breakneck pace. But the company compensated by expanding its highly profitable cloud and advertising businesses. Its revenue guidance fell short of expectations, sending shares down sharply in after-hours trading.Seeking a turnaround: G.E.\u2019s fourth-quarter results pointed to the depth of the company\u2019s challenges, despite a strong performance by the company\u2019s jet engine business. G.E. made no forecast for what its profit and revenue would look like this year, and its chief executive, Lawrence Culp, said that 2019 was \u201cstill very much a work in progress.\u201d The company also said that it had reached a $1.5 billion settlement in an investigation of its role in the 2008 financial crisis, reassuring investors.More earnings news: Nintendo shares dropped more than 9.3 percent after it cut its full-year target for sales of its Switch video game console.Revolving DoorIntel named its interim chief executive, Robert Swan, as its permanent leader, ending a seven-month search.

They had once hoped that their assembly line jobs would give them big enough paychecks to propel them into a better life. That was before consumers in China turned up their noses at Apple\u2019s new iPhone XR and its nearly $1,000 price. Work slowed. Overtime evaporated. And now workers are giving up.\u201cUsually we had 80 to 90 extra hours\u201d per month, said Zhang Zhi, 25, who had worked two years at the factory but was now standing in the quitting line. Starting in late October, her supervisors started sending her home early and giving her two-day weekends, eating into her overtime. In December, her pay totaled about $370, roughly half what she had made in the busiest months. Ms. Zhang found part-time work elsewhere that pays about $600 a month. Still, she said, \u201cit\u2019s better than staying here.\u201dChina\u2019s factories once made products for the rest of the world. These days, increasingly, Chinese factories make products for China as well. Its vast and still-emerging consumer class has opened up a hugely profitable market for global companies like Apple, Nike, General Motors and Volkswagen. Those companies in turn use Chinese factories to meet those needs.Today, China\u2019s consumers have grown more reluctant to spend, and many of the workers who depend on them have been hit. Lower demand for consumer goods has led to job losses and shrinking paychecks. That is worsening China\u2019s economic slowdown, which has posed a major challenge for Beijing and could put it at a disadvantage in the trade war with President Trump.China doesn\u2019t disclose reliable employment data, but signs of slowing factory work abound. Car and chemical factories are moving at a slower pace. China\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday begins next week, but some companies were sending home workers as early as December.ImageGuards outside the Changshuo factory, which is owned by Pegatron, a Taiwanese company.CreditYuyang Liu for The New York TimesHuojiancun isn\u2019t the only place where weak iPhone sales are leaving an impact. In the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, employment at a vast factory that makes iPhones has fallen to about 70,000 from the already low pre-Lunar New Year level of more than 100,000 a year ago, according to China Labor Watch, which tracks working conditions and speaks to workers in China. In a statement, the Zhengzhou factory\u2019s owner, the Taiwanese electronics supplier Foxconn, declined to comment directly on the group\u2019s figures but said it was constantly reviewing its operations and planned to add more than 50,000 positions across China in the first three months of the year. An Apple spokeswoman, Wei Gu, pointed to the company\u2019s previous statements and declined to comment further. Huojiancun is a rough industrial community on the edge of glittering Shanghai. Snack shops, calling card stalls and other small businesses catering to factory workers pervade the narrow streets and alleys surrounding the Changshuo plant.Workers there may make the iPhone, but they can\u2019t afford it. Even when their pay was at its peak, those assembly line workers would have needed more than a month\u2019s wages to buy a base-level iPhone XR. Still, jobs there for years were in high demand because they tended to pay more and offer better working conditions than elsewhere. Today, the situation is more complicated. Chinese workers are increasingly difficult to lure because they don\u2019t want to work so many hours on an assembly line. Chinese companies are increasingly exploring automation as labor costs rise. Supervisors kept workers from taking too many breaks and would dock their pay for infractions like littering, said Hou Fu\u2019an, a Changshuo worker who had quit and was heading back home in the interior province of Henan. As workers began to leave over missing hours, he said, many remaining workers started getting overtime again, fattening their paychecks but adding to the workload.\u201cInside the factory, workers are tightly controlled,\u201d Mr. Hou said. \u201cIf one person does not do well, everyone in the group will be yelled at by the group leader. But they did not yell much when there were not many workers left.\u201dThe Changshuo plant is owned by Pegatron, a Taiwanese contract assembler. Its shares have lost nearly a quarter of their value since the summer as the trade war with the United States mounted and as skepticism grew about the appeal of Apple\u2019s latest iPhone models, which were released in September.ImageChangshuo workers lining up for their severance pay.CreditYuyang Liu for The New York TimesA Pegatron spokeswoman, Ming-Chun Tsai, declined to comment on the Apple business.Every year, before Apple\u2019s usual September launches of its latest iPhones, the Changshuo factory adds temporary workers to accommodate the rush. It offers bonuses that can vary from $400 to $1,300 depending on demand, workers said. Qualified workers must be between 18 and 45 years old, be able to recognize the English alphabet and sport no visible tattoos, they said. Many workers then typically leave before the Lunar New Year holiday, when they generally qualify for their bonus. But workers and local businesses alike said more workers than usual were leaving this year. Huang Qionghuang owns a stall that sells bras that won\u2019t set off metal detectors, an essential undergarment in a factory that scans workers coming and going to make sure they aren\u2019t stealing or smuggling in cameras to take photos of the latest iPhone. In the past, October was her busy season. But sales slumped in recent months, and she dares not buy more bras to stock. The ones that did sell were the cheap ones, costing roughly $2.50.\u201cLast January, I earned more than my rent,\u201d Ms. Huang said. \u201cNow I can\u2019t even make enough to pay the rent,\u201d which she added was about $500 a month. \u201cThis is the worst year since I came here three years ago,\u201d she said.Pegatron holds an outsize presence in Huojiancun. Online, it says the plant employs 70,000. Neon signs hanging among the warren of stalls next door call them the \u201cPegatron night market.\u201d During busy seasons, according to local merchants, the streets and alleys are so crowded it can be difficult to move around.More recently, merchants said, the Pegatron night market has grown quieter. \u201cThere are fewer workers in the factory,\u201d said Xu Aihua, who opened a local restaurant with his mother eight years ago. Looking up from the chicken soup he was making, Mr. Xu pointed to the nearly empty street out front. \u201cSee? There\u2019s nobody.\u201dThat could mean tough times for him and his mother. Their rent costs about $1,500 per month. A year ago, his daily revenue totaled about $150. In recent months, he has earned about half that.

A year ago, his work hours were relatively steady. But this December, his overtime dwindled. \u201cI had three or four days without work in a week,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much was I going to earn?\u201dMr. Wang said he had found a new job, one that gave him more hours to pad his paycheck.\u201cI made the right decision,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not regret it.\u201d"}, {"title": "On Politics: Trump Says Border Talks Are a \u2018Waste of Time\u2019", "category": "Politics", "id": "a45f83ee-921e-4487-b09d-dad2f1ea779c", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/us/politics/on-politics-trump-interview-border-wall.html", "publishdate": 20190201, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Friday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today._____________________\u2022 In a lengthy Oval Office interview, President Trump told The New York Times that negotiating with Congress over his long-sought border wall was a \u201cwaste of time\u201d and that he would probably take action on it himself. He also spoke about the Russia investigation and the 2020 election. Here are five takeaways from the interview.\u2022 The Senate, in a stinging bipartisan rebuke to Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy, advanced legislation to express strong opposition to his decision to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan.\u2022 After two months of being cooped up in the White House, Mr. Trump will spend the weekend at his oasis, the place where he is most comfortable: Mar-a-Lago.\u2022 Mr. Trump said trade negotiations with China were going well but that no final agreement would be reached until he met with President Xi Jinping. He also warned that he was prepared to move ahead with higher tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing did not accede to America\u2019s demands.\u2022 Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign reported raising $21 million in the final three months of 2018. Three out of every four dollars came from small donors, a contrast to many Republican midterm congressional campaigns, which relied more on wealthy contributors.\u2022 The top American diplomat on North Korea, Stephen Biegun, signaled that the United States might soften its demand that North Korea list all its nuclear assets as a first step toward denuclearization.\u2022 Mr. Trump signed an executive order that will push for federal dollars spent on infrastructure projects to go to American companies. The measure is meant to bolster blue-collar Trump supporters whose economic prospects have been shaken by the president\u2019s trade policies.\u2022 Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a plan that would subject more wealthy Americans to the estate tax, joining a wave of left-wing politicians calling for new ways to tax the rich.\u2022 The Trump administration told Congress that it intends to make it much easier for gun manufacturers to sell firearms abroad. The administration also proposed to lower prescription drug costs by requiring insurers and middlemen to share the discounts they get with consumers.\u2022 Sexual assaults rose sharply at three American military academies over the last two years. Despite the Pentagon\u2019s efforts to encourage students to report assaults, unreported cases surged by almost 50 percent during the 2017-18 academic year, a Defense Department study found._____________________Today\u2019s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grull\u00f3n Paz in New York.Were you forwarded this newsletter?

As he transitions to a national presidential campaign, which he announced Friday, the candidate has been focusing on some key issues that animate the left wing of the Democratic Party.Criminal JusticeMr. Booker has made criminal justice reform a cornerstone of his Senate tenure. He sought early on to craft bipartisan bills that would have changed penalties for nonviolent crimes and reduced prison sentences, though neither effort became law. Late last year, Congress passed a criminal justice reform act, signed by President Trump, that Mr. Booker had originally sponsored. But during his time as mayor, Newark\u2019s police department faced accusations of brutality and intimidation, and the Department of Justice launched an investigation into the department; Mr. Booker said he \u201cwelcomed\u201d the inquiry.Health CareIn 2017, Mr. Booker announced his support for the Medicare for All Act drafted by Senator Bernie Sanders, and reiterated his support in an interview after he announced his candidacy Friday, saying \u201cI signed up and am a big believer in Medicare for all.\u201d But as a senator from New Jersey who had received millions in campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Booker had been reluctant to focus regulatory efforts on the industry, voting against a measure in 2017 that would have greatly reduced drug prices by allowing imports from Canada. He has since reversed course, announcing his support this year for Mr. Sanders\u2019s bill to rein in prescription drug costs.Green New DealMr. Booker said Friday that \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d will be one of the three top policy issues of his campaign. He has recently signed on to endorse the Green New Deal, a progressive litmus test on the environment pushed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, that pushes for investments in clean-energy infrastructure and policies to directly address climate change.EducationFrom his time as mayor of Newark, Mr. Booker has been a strong champion of charter schools, a stance that runs counter to the progressive Democratic base. And it\u2019s a position that he continues to hold. He said in a 2018 interview that \u201cmy loyalty is to a free public school, high-quality public school education,\u2019\u2019 adding that this includes charter schools.Education reform also gave Mr. Booker his most high-profile moment as mayor of Newark, when he went on The Oprah Winfrey Show with Gov. Chris Christie to announce that Mark Zuckerberg would be donating $100 million to turn around Newark\u2019s ailing school system. Though Mr. Booker defends the reforms made with the money, many critics have said it was not put to good use, and the city\u2019s system continued to teeter.Social IssuesMr. Booker has long been a proponent of many core Democratic issues, such as protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose and favoring same-sex marriage. He presided over New Jersey\u2019s first same-sex marriage ceremonies as a senator-elect in 2013. From his position on the Senate Judiciary Committee, he recently challenged Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over their views on gay rights.Legalizing MarijuanaIn 2017, Mr. Booker introduced legislation that would have legalized marijuana and expunged federal marijuana convictions from criminal records. While the bill had no hope of passing the Republican-held senate, Mr. Booker reiterated his support for legalizing marijuana after announcing his candidacy, telling a radio show that he was for \u201cchanging our drug laws, ending prohibition against marijuana.\u201d"}, {"title": "Net Neutrality Repeal at Stake as Key Court Case Starts", "category": "Business", "id": "d0304816-693e-4be0-9de6-012c7d0b4712", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/technology/net-neutrality-repeal-case.html", "publishdate": 20190201, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/02/business/02netneutrality/merlin_144668283_8511e234-ed6a-4146-8af4-75ef7dfc2d31-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Oral arguments were presented Friday in the most prominent lawsuit challenging the federal government\u2019s repeal of broadband access rules known as net neutrality. The Federal Communications Commission approved the rules in 2015 to ensure internet users equal and open access to all websites and services. The commission, under new leadership, rolled the rules back in 2017.The plaintiffs in the suit, led by the internet company Mozilla and supported by 22 state attorneys general, say the commission lacked a sound legal reason for scrapping the regulations. The government was expected to argue that the rules were repealed because of the burden they imposed on broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast.The case, before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, could wind through the courts for years. If the commission loses, it might try to rewrite its order rolling back the rules to avoid further legal challenges.The case is just one front in the fight over net neutrality. Here are two other forums where the subject continues to be fiercely debated.In the StatesImmediately after the commission voted to repeal the rules, state officials jumped into action. More than 30 states have introduced bills to add their own net neutrality protections. Nine, including California, New York, Rhode Island and Washington, have approved such regulations.That means people in those states are theoretically protected against moves by companies like AT&T and Charter that block or slow some web traffic. California even bans promotions for free streaming apps, a practice that can stifle the businesses of other websites that do not have the resources to offer such promotions. But court battles have complicated the enforcement of the laws. California\u2019s attorney general said the state would not enforce its rules until the federal appeals court ruled on the challenge to the commission\u2019s 2017 repeal.The state laws are being challenged in lawsuits filed by the Justice Department and USTelecom, the telecommunications industry\u2019s main trade group.In repealing the net neutrality rules, the commission included a provision barring states from creating their own regulations. The goal was to avoid a patchwork of rules across the country. Traditionally, states had authority over telecommunications within their borders, but companies and the federal government have argued that the internet\u2019s global nature makes it harder to regulate state by state. In CongressMembers of Congress are expected to introduce net neutrality laws this year that would create nationwide rules, overriding whatever states have adopted. Democrats are pushing the issue, and some Republicans have voiced support for minimal rules.Any legislation is unlikely to pass this year, with Republicans still controlling the Senate. But net neutrality will certainly continue to be a political talking point. It became a campaign issue in the 2018 midterms for Democrats, and the party sees it as a winning issue, particularly among young voters, heading toward the 2020 presidential election."}, {"title": "Taxing the Wealthy Sounds Easy.

This tax, on what she called the \u201ctippy tops\u201d of earners, would be graduated like the rest of the income code, so only a portion of the millionaires\u2019 income would be taxed at that high rate.And Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat preparing for a presidential campaign, has proposed a wealth tax of 2 percent on people with a net worth above $50 million and 3 percent on those with a net worth over $1 billion.Ms. Warren worked with Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two respected economists at the University of California, Berkeley, whose research focuses on income inequality. They estimated that such a tax would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years, which sounds like a lot but would account for just 1 percent of gross domestic product.The devil, though, is in the details.Such targeted tax policies have often been riddled with loopholes, as was the case with the highest marginal tax rates in the 1970s; become overly complex to enact, like the alternative minimum tax; or created unintended consequences that affected taxpayers beyond those originally intended.Ms. Warren\u2019s wealth tax, for example, has three major challenges.First, there is a huge gap in wealth between $50 million and $1 billion. There are far more people with wealth in the tens and hundreds of millions of dollars in the United States \u2014 39,735, according to Wealth-X, which tracks wealth in the world \u2014 than there are billionaires \u2014 680 \u2014 who would pay the higher 3 percent tax.If raising revenue is the object, increasing the tax rate for people at several intervals between $50 million and $1 billion, which are very different levels of wealth, would bring in more revenue, wealth experts said.As it stands, billionaires would contribute just $300 billion of the $2.75 trillion the higher rates are projected to raise over 10 years. Adding in rates would also allow Ms. Warren to increase the rate again for billionaires.A bigger issue is that a wealth tax may not be constitutional. The 16th Amendment provides only for an income tax. The estate, gift and generation-skipping taxes pass muster because they\u2019re deemed excise taxes on the transfer of wealth, not on the wealth itself.\u201cSenator Warren\u2019s proposal is based on a study by two scholars, and she\u2019s pursuing that,\u201d said Joanne Johnson, head of wealth advisory group at J. P. Morgan\u2019s private bank. \u201cThere is a lot of extremely important analysis that still has to occur.\u201dA third issue is logistical. A wealth tax would be like an estate tax levied every year. Figuring out the tax owed on large estates is complicated, costly and time-consuming. The Internal Revenue Service gives estates a year to file a return, but even then, executors often have to file extensions. And on the other end, auditors go through the returns, which can take years before an estate is settled.The process requires not just lawyers and accountants but valuation experts who assess the worth of assets like closely held family businesses.\u201cIt would be a highly cumbersome tax return to prepare on an annual basis,\u201d said Jeff Moes, executive vice president and chief fiduciary officer at FineMark National Bank & Trust, which serves high-net-worth clients. \u201cEvery federal estate tax goes through an audit, and presumably this would go through an audit as well. They\u2019d have to figure out if the valuation methodology is correct.\u201d\u201cA billionaire would have a return that would be literally three feet high,\u201d he added. \u201cOur $100 million clients own multiple closely held businesses. All of them would require an expert valuation and five-year financials.\u201dAnd then the government would need to have enough auditors to verify everything that was submitted. In 2018, for example, an estimated 4,000 estate tax returns will be filed, with tax owed on 1,900 of them. That\u2019s a tenth the number of tax returns that would be filed under Ms. Warren\u2019s wealth tax plan.As for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s idea, many economists have noted that a rate of 70 percent for the highest tax bracket has been in place before. But the tax environment in the 1970s was different from today\u2019s. (That top marginal kicked in at $200,000, or roughly $800,000 in today\u2019s dollars.)Back then, people could average their income over several years to reduce the large tax bite. There were also far more deductions that people could take than there are now.Maury Cartine, a partner at the accounting firm Marcum and a certified public accountant for 50 years, said that when the highest tax bracket was 70 percent in the 1970s, the tax on earned income \u2014 as opposed to investment income \u2014 was limited to 50 percent. At that time, an individual taxpayer could also deduct interest on any type of loan \u2014 car, educational, credit card \u2014 and not just on a home.\u201cA taxpayer could refinance appreciated rental property, take the proceeds to buy a yacht or some very nice jewelry and still deduct the interest,\u201d Mr. Cartine said.These deductions have been whittled away over the years. And in the current tax code, even deductions like those on state and local taxes or mortgage interest have been eliminated or curtailed. In other words, a 70 percent rate would be a much higher rate today, given the limited deductions, than it was in the 1970s.It\u2019s also worth looking back at the unintended consequences from similar policy-driven tax proposals.The alternative minimum tax was started in a different form in 1969. It was largely meant to target the 155 Americans who had incomes over $200,000 (roughly more than $1 million today) and hadn\u2019t paid any income tax. It was reformulated in 1982 but never indexed to inflation.So as incomes rose, more and more affluent people were hit by the tax, which reduced deductions and set a minimum tax rate of 26 and 28 percent. Affluent professionals living in areas with high property and state taxes that could be deducted, like the Northeast, were often subject to it.Timothy Speiss, partner in charge of the personal wealth advisers group at EisnerAmper, an accounting firm, said that by 2017, the alternative minimum tax had affected more affluent people than the truly wealthy.The Tax Policy Center noted that 27 percent of people earning $200,000 to $500,000 and 62 percent of people earning $500,000 to $1 million paid more in taxes in 2017 because of the tax, while only 20 percent of people earning more than $1 million paid higher taxes.A simpler example of unintended consequences is what\u2019s called the loss carry-forward provision. It allows people to deduct up to $3,000 a year in investment losses against their ordinary income. Yet that $3,000 was set in 1978, when it was worth significantly more and fewer people were broadly invested in financial markets through their retirement plans. It hasn\u2019t been adjusted in 40 years.\u201cAny parameter that is not indexed to inflation automatically creates unintended consequences as more people become subject to it,\u201d said Gil Charney, director of the Tax Institute at H & R Block. \u201cIt\u2019s also another example of the marriage penalty. It\u2019s $3,000 per return, not per person.\u201dLate this past week, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a potential Democratic presidential candidate, took a different tack in taxing the rich. He proposed applying an estate tax with a top rate of 77 percent for estates exceeding $1 billion.How Senator Warren\u2019s or Representative Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposal would work rests as much on proper execution as on the definition of wealthy."}, {"title": "Trump Sought a Loan During the 2016 Campaign.

Trump was burning through cash.It was early 2016, and he was lending tens of millions of dollars to his presidential campaign and had been spending large sums to expand the Trump Organization\u2019s roster of high-end properties.To finance his business\u2019s growth, Mr. Trump turned to a longtime ally, Deutsche Bank, one of the few banks still willing to lend money to the man who has called himself \u201cThe King of Debt.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s loan request, which has not been previously reported, set off a fight that reached the top of the German bank, according to three people familiar with the request. In the end, Deutsche Bank did something unexpected. It said no.Senior officials at the bank, including its future chief executive, believed that Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive candidacy made such a loan too risky, the people said. Among their concerns was that if Mr. Trump won the election and then defaulted, Deutsche Bank would have to choose between not collecting on the debt or seizing the assets of the president of the United States.Two of the people familiar with the loan request said the Trump Organization had been seeking to borrow against its Miami resort to pay for work on a golf property in Turnberry, Scotland.A Trump Organization spokeswoman, Amanda Miller, denied that the company had needed outside funding for Turnberry.\u201cThis story is absolutely false,\u201d Ms. Miller said. \u201cWe bought Trump Turnberry without any financing and put tens of millions of dollars of our own money into the renovation, which began in 2014. At no time was any money needed to finance the purchase or the refurbishment of Trump Turnberry.\u201dShe did not specifically address whether the Trump Organization had sought a loan from Deutsche Bank.ImageDonald J. Trump at the Turnberry resort in June 2016, when he was the presumptive Republican nominee for president. A Trump entity lent at least $45 million to the resort that year.CreditJeff J Mitchell/Getty ImagesTroy Gravitt, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, declined to comment.The failed loan request is an untold chapter in Mr. Trump\u2019s long and tortured relationship with the banking industry. It shows that he was actively engaged in running his business in the midst of the presidential campaign, and it is likely to attract scrutiny from Democrats on two House committees that are investigating his two-decade relationship with Deutsche Bank.In the early 1990s, Mr. Trump\u2019s hotel and casino properties declared bankruptcy four times, leaving prominent banks, including Citicorp and Manufacturers Hanover, with painful losses. The real estate mogul was all but excommunicated from Wall Street.Deutsche Bank, which was eager to gain a foothold in the lucrative American market and more tolerant of risk than many of its rivals, filled the void. In 1998, it lent Mr. Trump $125 million for renovations on a Wall Street skyscraper. The relationship blossomed, and over the next 17 years, Deutsche Bank lent or participated in loans to Mr. Trump and his companies totaling more than $2.5 billion.Then, just as the first votes were being cast in the Republican presidential primaries, Mr. Trump\u2019s lender of last resort got cold feet.The funding of Mr. Trump\u2019s golf empire has been something of a mystery.In the decade before he was elected president, Mr. Trump\u2019s company spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying or renovating about a dozen clubs and resorts around the world. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s self-proclaimed fondness for relying on debt, the Trump Organization has reported that it used its own money for most of the acquisitions and upgrades.A prominent golf journalist, James Dodson, said Mr. Trump\u2019s son Eric had told him in 2013 that the company\u2019s golf properties were funded by Russians. Eric Trump has denied making the comment.Mr. Trump did borrow money for some of his golf properties. In 2012, Deutsche Bank lent the Trump Organization a total of more than $100 million to finance the 72-hole Doral resort near Miami, home to the famed Blue Monster course.Two years later, the Trump Organization bought the Turnberry hotel and golf course for a reported $63 million. The course, which features sweeping views of the sea west of Scotland, has hosted the British Open several times.ImageDeutsche Bank lent more than $100 million to the Trump Organization to finance its Doral resort in Miami. In 2016, the organization suggested expanding the Doral loans to fund work on Turnberry.CreditEvan Vucci/Associated PressIn 2014 and 2015, a Trump legal entity lent at least $96 million to the subsidiary that operated Turnberry, according to British regulatory filings. The next year, the Trump Organization would go back to Deutsche Bank for more.The relationship between Mr. Trump and Deutsche Bank had survived some rocky moments. In 2008, amid the financial crisis, Mr. Trump stopped repaying a loan to finance the construction of a skyscraper in Chicago \u2014 and then sued the bank, accusing it of helping cause the crisis. After that lawsuit, Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment-banking arm severed ties with Mr. Trump.But by 2010, he was back doing business with Deutsche Bank through its private-banking unit, which catered to some of the world\u2019s wealthiest people. That unit arranged the Doral loans, and another in 2012 tied to the Chicago skyscraper.Mr. Trump\u2019s go-to in the private bank was Rosemary Vrablic, a senior banker in its New York office. In 2013, she was the subject of a flattering profile in The Mortgage Observer, a real estate magazine owned by Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was also among her clients. In 2015, she arranged the loan that financed Mr. Trump\u2019s transformation of Washington\u2019s Old Post Office Building into the Trump International Hotel, a few blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.In early 2016, as Mr. Trump was lending tens of millions of dollars to his campaign, his company contacted Ms. Vrablic about getting money for Turnberry, said two of the three people familiar with the request, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The proposal was to expand Deutsche Bank\u2019s outstanding loans backed by the Doral by well over $10 million and to use the proceeds for work on Turnberry, the people said.Around the time that Mr. Trump was winning New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, officials in the private-banking unit informed their superiors that they were inclined to provide him with the loan, according to one of the people familiar with the internal discussions.Senior executives in New York balked, arguing that Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy made such a loan unacceptably risky, the three people said. In part, they feared the bank\u2019s reputation could be harmed if the transaction were to become public because of the polarizing statements Mr. Trump was making on the campaign trail.Officials in the private-banking unit protested that Deutsche Bank already had numerous outstanding loans to Mr. Trump and that there was no reason not to make another, two of the people said. The decision was appealed to Deutsche Bank\u2019s top executives in Frankfurt.ImageRep. Adam Schiff wants to look closely at Deutsche Bank because it has previously paid regulatory penalties for laundering money for Russians.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesThat was the first time that some senior officials realized the extent of their bank\u2019s dealings with Mr. Trump, the three people said.The proposed loan was examined by an internal committee that is responsible for vetting transactions to ensure they do not pose serious risks to the bank\u2019s reputation, the people said. That March, the committee unanimously rejected the loan.  Christian Sewing \u2014 who was in charge of Deutsche Bank\u2019s wealth-management division and would become chief executive two years later \u2014 was among those who made the final decision, the people said.A Trump entity ended up lending at least $45 million to Turnberry that year, on top of the $96 million it had lent Turnberry in the previous two years.Even though the Deutsche Bank loan didn\u2019t go through, it will most likely draw the interest of congressional Democrats.Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election, has said he wants to look closely at Deutsche Bank because of its past involvement in laundering money for Russian nationals. And Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee, overseen by Representative Maxine Waters, have been asking questions about Deutsche Bank\u2019s loans to Mr. Trump since 2017.Mr. Schiff and Ms. Waters are planning to conduct a joint investigation of Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement with Deutsche Bank.During the campaign, Mr. Trump sought to take advantage of that relationship when rivals painted him as a bad businessman who was frozen out of the mainstream financial system.The same month that Deutsche Bank rejected the loan proposal, Mr. Trump sought to blunt those attacks by citing his warm relationships with Wall Street firms. He singled out Deutsche Bank.\u201cThey are totally happy with me,\u201d he told The New York Times in March 2016. \u201cI do business with them today.\u201d"}, {"title": "Medicare for All Emerges as Early Policy Test for 2020 Democrats", "category": "Politics", "id": "eb793c61-a1e6-4cef-827e-3ef668fd5c13", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/medicare-for-all-2020.html", "publishdate": 20190202, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/03/us/03healthpolitics-promo/03healthpolitics-promo-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren spoke at length this week about her vision for improving the American health care system, like strengthening the Affordable Care Act and making prescription drugs more affordable. Twice, though, she ignored a question posed to her: Would she support eliminating private health insurance in favor of a single-payer system?\u201cAffordable health care for every American\u201d is her goal, Ms. Warren said on Bloomberg Television, and there are \u201cdifferent ways we can get there.\u201dTo put it another way: I am not walking into that political trap.Ms. Warren of Massachusetts and three other liberal presidential candidates support a Medicare for All bill, which would create a single-payer health plan run by the government and increase federal spending by at least $2.5 trillion a year, according to several estimates. But Ms. Warren\u2019s determination to sidestep an essential but deeply controversial issue at the heart of the single-payer model \u2014 would people lose the choices offered by private insurance? \u2014 illustrated one of the thorniest dilemmas for several Democrats as the 2020 primary gets underway.[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]Their activist base, inspired by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, believes that the party should unabashedly pursue universal health care, ending private insurance entirely. But polls indicate that the broader electorate, particularly the moderate- and high-income voters who propelled the party\u2019s sweeping suburban gains in the midterms, is uneasy about this \u201cMedicare for all\u201d approach in which many would lose their current insurance options and pay higher taxes.Senator Kamala Harris of California drew immediate attacks from Republicans this week by taking on the issue that Ms. Warren dodged. Ms. Harris breezily acknowledged in a CNN town hall forum that she would \u201celiminate all of that,\u201d referring to ending private insurance in a country where almost 60 percent of the population receives coverage through an employer.Her remark triggered an intraparty debate about an issue that until now had been largely theoretical: A decade after Democrats pushed through the most significant expansion of health care since the Great Society, should they build incrementally on the Affordable Care Act or scrap the insurance sector entirely and create a European-style public program?Four Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 Ms. Harris, Ms. Warren, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2014 are among the co-sponsors of Mr. Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All bill, which would replace the Affordable Care Act with a single government health plan for all Americans. Medicare is the federal program providing health coverage to people 65 and older.ImageA Los Angeles rally supporting Medicare for all. Eighty-one percent of Democrats approve of the idea, according to a recent poll.CreditRonen Tivony/NurPhoto, via Getty ImagesThe concept of Medicare for all has become popular with Democrats: 81 percent support it, according to a recent Kaiser poll. Yet voter opposition to surrendering the insurance they are used to led to a backlash over President Barack Obama\u2019s repeated promise that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan\u201d after it proved false for several million people under his health law. Many Democrats are keenly aware of that backlash, and the 2020 presidential race will be the first where many of the party\u2019s leading candidates will have to explain and defend the meaning of Medicare for all.For now, as Ms. Warren demonstrated, many candidates do not want to wrestle publicly with the details. After Ms. Harris\u2019s comment, her aides hastened to add that she would also support less sweeping changes to health care; like most other candidates, Ms. Harris declined an interview request. And by Friday, Mr. Booker, hours after announcing his presidential bid, sought to curtail the matter by offering a brisk \u201cno\u201d when asked if he supported eliminating private coverage.Yet there is one likely 2020 contender who is thrilled to discuss Medicare for all.Mr. Sanders, in an interview, did not mince words: The only role for private insurance in the system he envisioned would be \u201ccosmetic surgery, you want to get your nose fixed.\u201d\u201cEvery candidate will make his or her own decisions,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, but \u201cif I look at polling and 70 percent of the people support Medicare for All, if a very significant percentage of people think the rich, the very rich, should start paying their fair share of taxes, I think I\u2019d be pretty dumb not to develop policies that capture what the American people want.\u201dBut Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who is considering a 2020 bid on a centrist Democratic platform, said it would be folly to even consider a single-payer system. \u201cTo replace the entire private system where companies provide health care for their employees would bankrupt us for a very long time,\u201d Mr. Bloomberg told reporters in New Hampshire on Tuesday.The Congressional Budget Office has not scored Mr. Sanders\u2019s Medicare for All bill, but a study last year by the Mercatus Center of George Mason University predicted it would increase federal spending by at least $32.6 trillion over the first decade. The cost could be even greater, the study says, if the bill overestimated the projected savings on administrative and drug costs, as well as payments to health care providers.The divide between Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist, and Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, reflects the large chasm in a party that has been reshaped by President Trump.The president\u2019s hard-line nationalism has simultaneously nudged Democrats to the left, emboldening them to pursue unambiguously liberal policies, and drawn independents and moderate Republicans to the party because they cannot abide his incendiary conduct and demagogy on race. These dueling forces have created a growing but ungainly coalition that shares contempt for Mr. Trump but is less unified on policy matters like health care.And these divisions extend to what is wisest politically.Liberals argue that the only way to drive up turnout among unlikely voters or win back some of the voters uneasy with Hillary Clinton\u2019s ties to corporate interests is to pursue a bold agenda and elevate issues like Medicare for all.ImageRepresentative Pramila Jayapal of Washington will soon become the main sponsor of a Medicare for All bill similar to the one led by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.CreditPete Marovich/EPA, via Shutterstock\u201cThose who run on incremental changes are not the ones who are going to get people excited and get people to turn out,\u201d said Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.And by preserving their options, Democrats risk alienating liberal primary voters, some of whom consider support for Medicare for all a litmus test.\u201cThe center is not a good place to be on these policies anymore,\u201d said Mary O\u2019Connor, 61, a substitute teacher and horse farmer in Middleburg, Va., who wants a single-payer system. \u201cI\u2019ll be watching extremely closely, and I will most likely jump on board and volunteer for whoever it is that\u2019s going to be the most forceful for this.\u201dBut moderates believe that most Democratic primary voters are more fixated on defeating Mr. Trump than applying litmus tests \u2014 and that terminating employer-sponsored insurance would only frighten the sort of general election voters who are eager to cast out Mr. Trump but do not want to wholly remake the country\u2019s health care system.\u201cMost of the freshmen who helped take back the House got elected on: \u2018We\u2019re going to protect your health insurance even if you have a pre-existing condition,\u2019 not \u2018We\u2019re going to take this whole system and throw it out the window,\u2019\u201d said Kenneth Baer, a Democratic strategist.While polling does show that Medicare for all \u2014 a buzz phrase that has lately been applied to everything from single-payer health care to programs that would allow some or all Americans to buy into Medicare or Medicaid \u2014 has broad public support, attitudes swing significantly depending on not just the details, but respondents\u2019 age and income.On the House side, a bill similar in scope to Mr. Sanders\u2019s is under revision and will soon be reintroduced with Ms. Jayapal as the main sponsor. Other Democrats have introduced less expansive \u201cMedicare buy-in\u201d bills, which would preserve the current system but would give certain Americans under 65 the option of paying for Medicare or a new \u201cpublic option\u201d plan. Another bill would give every state the option of letting residents buy into Medicaid, the government health program for poor Americans.The buy-in programs would generally cover between 60 and 80 percent of people\u2019s medical costs and would require much less federal spending because enrollees would still pay premiums and not everyone would be eligible. Some proponents, like Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, have described them as a steppingstone on the way to a full single-payer system; some of the Democrats running for president are co-sponsoring these \u201cMedicare for more\u201d bills as well as Mr. Sanders\u2019s.Mr. Sanders has suggested options to raise the money needed for his plan, such as a new 7.5 percent payroll tax and a wealth tax on the top 0.1 percent of earners. He has also predicted several trillion dollars in savings over 10 years from eliminating the tax exclusion that employers get on what they pay toward their workers\u2019 insurance premiums, and other tax breaks.But Robert Blendon, a health policy professor at Harvard who studies public opinion, said it would be wise not to delve into financing details for now.\u201cThe reason it failed in Vermont and Colorado was taxes,\u201d Professor Blendon said, referring to recent efforts to move to a near-universal health care system in those states, which flopped resoundingly because they would have required major tax increases. \u201cBut Democratic primary voters will not go deep into asking how these plans will work. What they will say is, \u2018Show me you have a principle that health care is a human right.\u2019\u201dThe general election will be a different story, Professor Blendon added. If Ms. Harris were to become the Democratic nominee and keep embracing the idea of ending private coverage, he argued, \u201cshe\u2019s going to have terrible problems.\u201dThe difficulty for Democrats, added Ezekiel Emanuel, a former Obama health care adviser, is that many voters look at the health care system the same way they view politics. \u201cThey say Congress is terrible but I like my congressman,\u201d as Mr. Emanuel put it.According to the Gallup poll, 70 percent of Americans with private insurance rate their coverage as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood;\u201d 85 percent say the same about the medical care they receive. The Kaiser poll found that the percentage of Americans who support a national health plan drops by 19 percentage points when people hear that it would eliminate insurance companies or that it would require Americans to pay more in taxes.Among those who make over $90,000 a year \u2014 the sort of voters in the House districts that several Democrats captured in the midterms \u2014 those surveyed in the Kaiser poll were particularly wary of an all-government system: 64 percent in this income group said they would oppose a Medicare for all plan that terminated private insurance.\u201cMy constituents are tired of bumper sticker debates about complex issues,\u201d said Representative Lizzie Pannill Fletcher of Texas, a freshman from an affluent Houston district. \u201cWe don\u2019t want ideologues in charge.\u201dIn Vermont, where former Gov. Peter Shumlin shelved his ambitious plan for a single-payer system in 2014 after conceding it would require \u201cenormous\u201d new taxes, advocates for universal health care are now resigned to a more incremental approach.Dr. Deb Richter, a primary care doctor who helped lead the state\u2019s single-payer movement, said that while the Democratic field is \u201cgoing to have to face the T word,\u201d being upfront about the required tax increases, she now thinks phasing in a government-run system is a better approach.\u201cThere\u2019s ways of doing this that don\u2019t have to happen all at once,\u201d she said, pointing to a push in Vermont to start with universal government coverage for primary care only. \u201cBut you need to talk about the end goal: We are aiming for Medicare for all, and this is a way of getting it done.\u201d"}, {"title": "McKinsey Advised Purdue Pharma How to \u2018Turbocharge\u2019 Opioid Sales, Lawsuit Says", "category": "Business", "id": "9314c895-a969-49c5-9057-e14ada2faa7a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/purdue-pharma-mckinsey-oxycontin-opiods.html", "publishdate": 20190202, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/19/business/19purduemckinsey1/merlin_149883558_57e930ff-6348-42d3-a87a-beaa979c7843-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The world\u2019s most prestigious management-consulting firm, McKinsey & Company, has been drawn into a national reckoning over who bears responsibility for the opioid crisis that has devastated families and communities across America.In legal papers released in unredacted form on Thursday, the Massachusetts attorney general said McKinsey had helped the maker of OxyContin fan the flames of the opioid epidemic. McKinsey\u2019s consultants, the attorney general revealed, had instructed the drug company, Purdue Pharma, on how to \u201cturbocharge\u201d sales of OxyContin, how to counter efforts by drug enforcement agents to reduce opioid use, and were part of a team that looked at how \u201cto counter the emotional messages from mothers with teenagers that overdosed\u201d on the drug.The McKinsey disclosures are part of a lawsuit Massachusetts filed against Purdue Pharma, accusing the company of misleading doctors and patients about the safety of opioid use. Even when the company knew patients were addicted and dying, it still tried to boost sales of opioids, the lawsuit alleges, adding, \u201cAll the while, Purdue peddled falsehoods to keep patients away from safer alternatives.\u201dPurdue Pharma helped plant the seeds of the opioid epidemic through its aggressive marketing of OxyContin. More than 130 people die each day in the United States \u2014 47,000 in 2017 \u2014 after overdosing on opioids, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.As the death toll from opioid abuse has climbed, the cast of those who are alleged to have contributed to the crisis \u2014 manufacturers, distributors, doctors, pharmacists, hospitals and regulatory agencies \u2014 has grown. McKinsey is the newest and perhaps most surprising actor in this drama.\u201cFrom our initial review of the complaint, it appears that some of the references to McKinsey\u2019s work lack context, including references to McKinsey that appear to be second- or third-hand,\u201d McKinsey said in a statement, adding that it was continuing to review the document.The suit, filed last year, names several Purdue executives and board members as well as members of the Sackler family, which controls the privately held company. McKinsey is mentioned 71 times in the 275-page complaint. The unredacted version was first reported by ProPublica and the medical news website Stat.In 2009, McKinsey wrote a report for Purdue Pharma saying that new sales tactics would increase sales of OxyContin by $200 million to $400 million annually and \u201csuggested sales \u2018drivers\u2019 based on the ideas that opioids reduce stress and make patients more optimistic and less isolated,\u201d according to the lawsuit.It was that year that Craig Landau, then Purdue\u2019s chief medical officer and now its chief executive, had an email exchange that included a McKinsey consultant about how to counter mothers whose teenagers had overdosed on OxyContin. The solution: bring in patients to emphasize how the drug helps to relieve pain.In 2013, amid the rapidly intensifying opioid crisis, the federal Drug Enforcement Administration and the Justice Department reached a settlement with Walgreens, the second-biggest American pharmacy chain. Walgreens agreed to new procedures to crack down on illegal prescriptions. In a report to Purdue Pharma, McKinsey said that \u201cdeep examination of Purdue\u2019s available pharmacy purchasing data shows that Walgreens has reduced its units by 18%.\u201dAccording to the lawsuit, McKinsey recommended that Purdue \u201clobby Walgreens\u2019 leaders to loosen up.\u201dMcKinsey also recommended that Purdue redirect its sales force to focus on doctors who were especially prolific prescribers of OxyContin, according to the suit. One slide made public by the attorney general\u2019s office, attributed to McKinsey, focused on one doctor in the town of Wareham, Mass., who almost doubled his annual output of OxyContin prescriptions after a big increase in visits from Purdue sales representatives.If doctors resisted, McKinsey recommended that Purdue employ \u201cpatient pushback,\u201d getting patients to lobby for OxyContin, according to the suit.In a statement, Purdue said that the Massachusetts attorney general\u2019s office \u201coffers little evidence to support its sweeping legal claims.\u201d The company also said that the lawsuit mischaracterized McKinsey\u2019s work with Purdue.On a chat site where participants must have a McKinsey email address to register for the company\u2019s discussion room, several expletive-laced expressions of outrage over the revelations of McKinsey\u2019s work with Purdue were mixed with comments about the responsibility to serve the client\u2019s bottom line within moral and ethical boundaries.\u201cThen, of course it\u2019s ok to maximize shareholder value, seek profits!,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cBut not at all costs, not at the cost of our moral values and our society\u2019s well being.\u201dAnother person\u2019s post \u2014 like all 42 entries about Purdue and McKinsey posted by midday Friday, it was anonymous \u2014 reproduced a bullet point from McKinsey\u2019s values statement stating that the company will \u201cobserve high ethical standards.\u201dThat is the second bullet point printed on the framed poster listing McKinsey\u2019s mission and values that graces the 21st-floor lobby of McKinsey\u2019s home office in Midtown Manhattan. The first reads: \u201cput client interests ahead of the Firm\u2019s.\u201dIn 2018, after it spent years advising Purdue Pharma on how to increase sales of OxyContin, McKinsey published a report titled: \u201cWhy we need bolder action to combat the opioid epidemic.\u201d"}, {"title": "On Politics: The Biggest Stories of the Week", "category": "Politics", "id": "3bdae359-40f3-4e9b-9ed5-df4bdd0a609c", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/on-politics-the-biggest-stories-of-the-week.html", "publishdate": 20190202, "imageurl": "", "content": "From foreign policy developments to the growing 2020 primary field, it\u2019s been a busy week in American politics.

President Trump lashed out at his intelligence agencies on Wednesday, defending his North Korea stance and accusing them of being \u201cpassive and na\u00efve\u201d about Iran.In another challenge to Venezuela\u2019s embattled president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the Trump administration on Monday announced sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil monopoly. On Wednesday, Mr. Maduro warned Americans that intervening in his country \u201cwould lead to a Vietnam worse than they can imagine.\u201dAmerican and Taliban officials agreed in principle on Monday to the outlines of a deal for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. A question is whether the United States can avoid handing over the country to the same militants it went to war to dislodge.The United States began trade talks with China on Wednesday that could prove critical to the trajectory of the world economy, but self-inflicted economic wounds from Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies could mean lost leverage.The Trump administration said on Friday that it was suspending one of the last major nuclear arms control treaties with Russia, after five years of heated talks that failed to resolve American accusations that Moscow is violating the agreement.Additional Reading\u2022  U.S. Appears to Soften Timing for List of North Korea\u2019s Nuclear Assets\u2022  On Venezuela, Rubio Assumes U.S. Role of Ouster in Chief\u2022  Huawei and Top Executive Face Criminal Charges in the U.S.The 2020 field got a little bigger.Another Democrat joined what is looking like one of the most diverse and crowded primary fields in history.

China was again a culprit when Nvidia warned last month that its revenue would come in 20 percent below expectations, though the graphics chip maker also blamed slack demand from Bitcoin miners and cloud data centers.Intel, the big chip maker, cited intensifying \u201ctrade and macro concerns\u201d for financial results in January that did not meet expectations. And Samsung, another semiconductor powerhouse, said sales plunged 10 percent in the fourth quarter because of weakening demand for its memory chips from data centers and smartphones.China, smartphones, Bitcoin and cloud computing have been among the major drivers of the long tech boom, which in turn has powered the global economy for the last decade. The ingredient common to all of these sectors is computer chips, which form the brains of devices and whose ubiquity means they provide early signals about changes in supply and demand.Warnings about a sales slowdown this year have come in recent weeks from big chip suppliers that also include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Micron Technology and Western Digital. It\u2019s an abrupt reversal, coming on the heels of stellar results in 2018 for the business that gave Silicon Valley its name.Last year, manufacturers shipped a staggering 1 trillion chips and other semiconductor devices, 10 percent more than the year before, IC Insights estimates. But 2019 is shaping up to be a much different story, now that several important sources of chip demand appear to be dampening.The notion that a chip dip could lead to a general downturn evokes memories of 2000, when one day tech had an unlimited future and the next it was crashing in what became known as the dot-com bust.Back then, investors showed no mercy. Intel made what seemed a modest adjustment to its revenue forecast for the third quarter of 2000, saying it would be up 3 to 5 percent instead of 7 to 9 percent. The value of the company immediately fell by nearly 30 percent over the next few days.This year, with a similar downgrade, investors largely shrugged it off. Intel shed about 5 percent of its value over a week.While acknowledging the parallels to 2000, Gene Munster, research director for Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm, said, \u201cI think it\u2019s different this time.\u201dBack then, among the best customers for the established chip firms were start-ups, which had more dreams than revenue. As the start-ups faltered, the chip firms were imperiled. The storm lasted for years.\u201cThese are all real companies now, with real customers,\u201d Mr. Munster said. \u201cPeople are willing to look past a few bumpy months.\u201dEven if the problems do not linger, they are a reminder that demand is not eternal. That seems to be what happened with smartphones, which use multiple varieties of chips to run software, process data and connect to cellular networks.Consider Apple, which gave a muted forecast in October for the holiday season and followed up early last month with its first full-fledged revenue warning in 16 years. The iPhone maker faces stiff competition and slumping demand in China. Total smartphone shipments fell 15 percent in that country in the fourth quarter, according to research firm Canalys.Michael Wolf, who surveys consumers annually about their technology and media usage for his management consulting firm Activate, said people seem to be shifting to lower-priced phone models and cheaper service plans. But he said demand seems strong for digital subscription services like Netflix, video games, online advertising and business-to-business sales for companies like Microsoft.\u201cFrom all of our research, I don\u2019t see some general consumer malaise,\u201d Mr. Wolf said.Yet several other businesses appear to be softening as well, including the market for server systems used by cloud service operators, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Sales of high-priced chips for such hardware have driven profits for companies like Intel and Nvidia, but they now say that equipment buyers for data centers have turned cautious.\u201cCloud service providers shifted from building capacity to absorbing capacity,\u201d Robert Swan, who was then Intel\u2019s chief financial officer and acting chief executive, said on a conference call after Intel released its fourth-quarter results. (On Thursday, Mr. Swan became Intel\u2019s chief executive.)Longtime tech industry watchers began picking up trouble signs late last spring in the market for memory chips, an essential component in computers that in decades past prompted trade tensions between the United States and rivals in Japan and South Korea. Makers of a key category called dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, have suffered product shortages and gluts that whipsawed pricing and heralded changing fortunes for the broader industry.During the dot-com bust of 2001, DRAM revenue plummeted 63 percent while total semiconductor revenue fell 31 percent, according to Gartner data.But conditions changed dramatically over the years as manufacturers fled from the lack of profits, leaving three major DRAM makers \u2014 Samsung, Hynix and Micron. They have been slow to boost production, enabling them to keep their prices high. And they also benefited as memory became more important in smartphones, data center hardware and other products beyond the personal computers that once drove most sales.\u201cThe markets today are structurally different,\u201d Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron\u2019s chief executive, said in a recent interview.Yet market cycles haven\u2019t disappeared entirely. DRAM prices peaked last June and began sliding, prompting Micron and Samsung to issue their recent profit warnings. DRAMeXchange, a Taiwan-based firm that tracks the market, predicts DRAM prices will fall an additional 20 percent in the first quarter.Memory chips \u201cbehave like onions or steel or any other commodity,\u201d said Jim Handy, a market researcher at Objective Analysis. \u201cIf there is an oversupply, prices fall.\u201dNvidia presents an extreme example of both boom and bust. The 25-year-old company, which pioneered the specialized processors that generate images in video games, became one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most valuable companies in 2017 as those chips were adapted for artificial intelligence uses by internet giants.But Nvidia\u2019s processors also became extremely popular for the mathematical process of mining digital currency, driving a surge in demand that inflated prices and created a shortage of chips. Buyers wound up placing multiple or overly ambitious orders, making it hard for the company to get a handle on conventional demand for its technology.The cryptocurrency bubble faded suddenly last year, causing Nvidia\u2019s revenue and stock price to tumble as the company wound up with extra inventories of unsold chips. The crypto issue \u201cended up being way, way bigger\u201d for the company than expected, said Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy story.\u201dFor all the turmoil, industry executives and analysts said that business conditions remain a lot healthier than past semiconductor slumps. For one thing, a series of mergers has reduced price competition. Companies like Micron, which routinely lost money in past cycles, are expected to remain solidly profitable even if sales dip.Beyond that, there is the glorious future.\u201cEventually the storm will pass and these companies \u2014 Nvidia, Apple, Samsung \u2014 will have a pole position in the next tech growth curve, including A.I., health care, self-driving cars, 5G,\u201d said Mr. Munster, the Loup analyst. \u201cThe curve is so exciting, so juicy, so full of opportunity.\u201d"}, {"title": "Super Bowl Commercials 2019: Brands Play It Safe and Look to the Future", "category": "Business", "id": "c2cde410-31ad-4999-956c-0e905d9bf60b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/business/media/super-bowl-commercials-live-updates.html", "publishdate": 20190203, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/04/business/04SUPERBOWLADS-01/merlin_150026595_1697e68e-560f-4834-bc5e-6f4391fdf3cb-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Super Bowl Sunday is the day when the advertising industry is not only tolerated but celebrated. And as in years past, brands paid millions of dollars this year for the opportunity to make consumers laugh, cry and reach for their wallets.The advertisers for Super Bowl LIII seemed determined to steer clear of controversy for a second year after politically tinged spots stole the show in 2017.Instead, they offered commercials that championed women, looked to the future and also inspired nostalgia for the \u201990s \u2014 accompanied, of course, by a parade of celebrities. Cameos included Serena Williams, Jason Bateman, Cardi B and the Backstreet Boys. There was a surprise mash-up between Bud Light and HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d and Burger King relied on vintage footage of Andy Warhol eating a Whopper for its Super Bowl moment.[Follow along with live updates and analysis from Mercedes-Benz Stadium.]\u201cIt seems like there\u2019s an awful lot of humor and light appeals, and that for advertisers it\u2019s somewhat of a play-it-safe year,\u201d said Charles R. Taylor, a professor of marketing at the Villanova University School of Business. \u201cWe\u2019re not hearing about anything crossing over in politics.\u201dWendy Clark, the chief executive of the agency DDB Worldwide, said that it was hard for ads to break through during a quiet game, describing the array as something of a \u201cmishmash.\u201d\u201cI kind of look at some of these and think, some of them are just fine ads \u2014 I\u2019m just not sure they\u2019re Super Bowl ads,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cPeople have perhaps forgotten that yes, you\u2019ve got all these eyes and attention, but there is still competition for people being around you and talking to you and food and drink and the game itself.\u201dThe talk about trouble for the TV business has never extended to the Super Bowl, where the average cost of a 30-second spot climbed to a cool $5.2 million last year, according to Kantar Media. It is roughly the same this year. That figure rose by 96 percent in the previous decade, while the average rate for other prime-time ads fell by 12 percent, according to the firm. More than 100 million people were expected to watch the CBS telecast.Bud Light turns into \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019Bud Light ran two spots that got people talking, both featuring its medieval cast of characters.One began with a joust and allowed \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d characters, including a dragon, to hijack the spot, ultimately advertising both Bud Light and the final season of the much-loved HBO show, which starts on April 14. (Ultimately, fans might be thirstier for the show than the beer.) The spot tapped into the same show enthusiasm that Doritos harnessed last year with an ad that featured Morgan Freeman and Peter Dinklage.\u201cIf you look at Bud Light, they\u2019ve been in this medieval world, so it\u2019s smart on their part to try to get at the love of \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019\u201d said Liz Taylor, chief creative officer of the agency FCB\u2019s Chicago office. But it\u2019s an uncommon type of collaboration, she said.Ms. Clark of DDB said, \u201cNo one saw that coming as a \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 ad, and I thought it was a fantastic and very brave pair-up.\u201dThe agency Droga5, which collaborated with Bud Light\u2019s agency, Wieden+Kennedy, said that more than 25 people from the show\u2019s crew worked on the ad. That included David Nutter, who has directed several of notable \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d episodes. The agencies sought to mimic the unexpected twists from the show by killing off the Bud Knight.Chris Spadaccini, HBO\u2019s head of marketing, said the network was looking for a \u201cpartner that would be willing to make a bold sacrifice \u2018for the throne.\u2019\u201dEarlier, Bud Light ran a commercial that showed its characters receiving a shipment of corn syrup, supposedly meant for either Miller Lite or Coors Light. MillerCoors quickly responded, saying that none of its products contain \u201cany high fructose corn syrup\u201d and that a number of Anheuser-Busch items do.

That includes Amazon, which had a Super Bowl ad for the fourth time.Amazon showed a trailer for a new show called \u201cHanna\u201d on its Prime streaming service and another ad for its Alexa devices. The latter included celebrities like Harrison Ford, Forest Whitaker and the \u201cBroad City\u201d stars Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson.Amazon, which ran its first Super Bowl ad in 2016, has become a big presence as its overall marketing spending has increased. Last year, the company was one of the game\u2019s five biggest advertisers for the first time, according to Kantar, on a list that included Anheuser-Busch, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota and Procter & Gamble.Last year, Amazon raised its ad spending in the United States by about 73 percent, Kantar said, outspending companies like General Motors, Verizon and L\u2019Or\u00e9al.\u201cTheir presence makes a lot of sense to me,\u201d Professor Rucker said. \u201cTheir target is probably a massive portion of everyone watching.\u201dOn a somewhat related note, The Washington Post made a last-minute decision to run a spot \u2014 a first for the newspaper. The ad, which ran in the fourth quarter and was narrated by Tom Hanks, highlighted \u201creporters\u2019 work and the importance of press freedom,\u201d Fred Ryan, the newspaper\u2019s publisher, said in a statement.ImageDoritos aimed to appeal to multiple generations with a Super Bowl spot featuring the Backstreet Boys and Chance the Rapper.CreditDoritosIt showed images of journalists from several news organizations, including CNN and Fox News, and referred to the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident journalist who wrote for the newspaper before he was killed in October.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as the voice-over for its Super Bowl ad. The timing didn\u2019t help, considering one story line last season was about N.F.L. players who sat or knelt during the national anthem to draw attention to racial oppression and police brutality against black Americans.Two years ago, after the presidential election, Airbnb and 84 Lumber ran spots that were viewed as responses to President Trump\u2019s stance on immigration.This year, advertisers sought to tie themselves to social causes. Budweiser, for example, highlighted its efforts in renewable energy in a spot that featured a charming dog, the beverage company\u2019s Clydesdales and the Bob Dylan song \u201cBlowin\u2019 in the Wind.\u201d And Verizon, for a second year, put a spotlight on emergency workers.One brand appeared to seek attention by creating an ad it claimed was too racy for CBS \u2014 a tried-and-true strategy for many previous advertisers. Devour, a maker of frozen meals, riffed on the concept of \u201cfood porn\u201d for its spot, with a girlfriend discussing her boyfriend\u2019s addiction to tantalizing footage of frozen food. Ultimately, Devour released a more saucy version of its ad online and one that was deemed appropriate for television.Still, the family-approved version may lead to some questions from the children in the room."}, {"title": "2020 Democrats Agree: They\u2019re Very, Very Sorry", "category": "Politics", "id": "b30039a8-0592-447f-aba0-8c5a25bf39da", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/us/politics/democrats-2020-apologies.html", "publishdate": 20190203, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/04/us/politics/04apologies2/04apologies2-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The Democratic Party\u2019s presidential hopefuls differ on their approach to policy issues such as income inequality and climate change, but on one thing there is almost uniform agreement: They\u2019re all very, very sorry.The most recent high-profile mea culpa came Thursday when Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts apologized for her controversial decision to take a DNA test to prove her decades-old claim of Native American ancestry.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. recently lamented his role in crafting the tough-on-crime drug legislation of the 1980s and 1990s. Senator Kamala Harris of California said she regretted some of the positions her office took while she was a state prosecutor. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said her past hard-line stances on immigration \u201ccertainly weren\u2019t empathetic and they were not kind.\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont apologized after reports of gender discrimination and sexual harassment in his 2016 presidential campaign.The spate of sorrys is indicative of a crowded field of Democratic candidates who understand that the party\u2019s increasingly diverse base can be uncompromising on issues such as discrimination, criminal justice reform and immigration and often expects candidates to stand more boldly on questions of identity including race, gender and sexuality.\u201cThis is about morals,\u201d said Steven Drahozal, the chair of the Dubuque County Democrats in Iowa. He said voters in Iowa, the critical early primary state, will actually appreciate a candidate who recognizes and acknowledges previous shortcomings. But he said Democratic candidates need to be acutely sensitive to those who in the past have been left behind. \u201cNot intending to offend is not an excuse,\u2019\u2019 he said.What is less clear is whether what works in a primary will be harmful in the general election and whether the cascade of apologies risks making Democrats look like the hypersensitive, politically correct crowd Republicans make them out to be \u2014 especially when compared with President Trump, who often insults and offends people and almost never apologizes for anything.The zero tolerance on issues of race also played out in the almost immediate demands by nearly all the Democratic presidential candidates that Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia resign over a racist yearbook photo. (Mr. Northam began with an apology but pivoted to a new defense when he triggered a crush of calls for him to resign.)Political strategists and crisis communication experts said the sensitivity speaks to how quickly the center of gravity has shifted for Democrats on key issues. As recently as 2006, national Democrats including former President Barack Obama expressed wariness about immigrants\u2019 ability to assimilate into American culture and did not openly embrace gay marriage \u2014 two talking points that would probably be deeply damaging for any 2020 candidate.For candidates seeking to lead the party into its post-Obama era, their hope is that the base is more concerned with defeating President Trump and Republicans than holding every candidate to rigid standards of ideological purity.\u201cThere is no perfect progressive candidate, there is no perfect anyone,\u201d said Yvette Simpson, chief executive of Democracy for America, a political group that is trying to build grass-roots support for the Democratic nominee.\u201cWe\u2019ve also got to give people grace and space to grow and to acknowledge that,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m always open and willing to hear how people grow.\u201dBut this is not true for more ideologically leftist elements of the party, who are more interested in building support based on ideals than the success or failure of any individual Democrat.Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, the group that helped elect Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and is targeting several incumbent legislators in the House, recently shared an old video of Ms. Harris critiquing the social justice mantra \u201cschools, not jails.\u201dImageSenator Kamala Harris of California has said she regretted some of the positions her office took while she was a state prosecutor.CreditTom Brenner for The New York Times\u201cThis video is from 2013 but it\u2019s still pretty disappointing to hear @KamalaHarris mock one of the slogans of the movement to end mass incarceration: \u2018Schools Not Jails.\u2019 Many of the people carrying those signs across the country later formed the #BlackLivesMatter movement,\u201d Mr. Shahid tweeted last month. \u201cHarris\u2019 views in 2013 are now increasingly out-of-touch with the Democratic Party.\u201dAnother reason for the run of apologies was a 2016 presidential election that totally upended the playbook, political observers said.While Mr. Trump offended people across the political spectrum without paying a price, Democrats saw their base repeatedly penalize Hillary Clinton over her past policies and rhetoric.Candidates this cycle have been determined to not mimic Mrs. Clinton\u2019s fate, said Zac Petkanas, a Democratic strategist who served as a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton in 2016. He said he was not surprised so many presidential hopefuls have tried to get ahead of their most worrisome issues well before the campaign heats up.\u201cThey are trying to address any potential issue that could come up on the campaign trail so they can later point to the fact that they have addressed it in the past and that they have moved on from it,\u201d Mr. Petkanas said.\u201cIn a lot of ways, it\u2019s a way to avoid a sort of email situation that Hillary Clinton went through where she was asked for months and months and months whether she would apologize,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she did, her critics said it was too late.\u201dBut not all apologies are created equal, said two crisis communications experts who have counseled public figures and companies through scandal. Voters want to see contrition, but also authenticity and reflection, without a candidate appearing overly weak.Historically, voters have also taken into account who is doing the apologizing. Female politicians have frequently been held to higher standards than their male counterparts, and their choice about whether to apologize can be complicated by factors such as sexism.Andrew Gilman, the chief executive of the Washington-based crisis communications firm CommCore Consulting Group, said politicians are recognizing that some voters and constituencies might not be receptive to their message unless they apologize for past blunders first.\u201cThis might be a precondition for some people to listen to the rest of what you want to say,\u201d Mr. Gilman said. \u201cBut I think you need to stand for something, not just apologize for something. It becomes less of an issue in this gotcha world if you can get it out early if it\u2019s perceived to be sincere.\u201dSara Brady, a crisis and reputation management expert, said that apologies do make a difference if they convey sincerity.\u201cThe general public is really forgiving but they also see through inauthenticity. They know when an apology is sincere and when it isn\u2019t,\u201d Ms. Brady said.For Democrats, the frequency of apologies has already reached parody status. Mr. Gilman said he would not be surprised to see a sketch on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d about which Democrat was the best apologist, and the satirical website The Onion has already joined in.On Friday, when Ms. Warren\u2019s apology became public and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey announced his presidential bid, the site merged the two themes into one catchall headline: \u201cCory Booker Apologizes To Wall Street Bankers For The Mean Things He\u2019s Going To Have To Say About Them.\u201d"}, {"title": "HBO Made Sunday Night a Showcase.

There was even once a marketing slogan, \u201cSunday is \u2026 HBO.\u201dThat\u2019s about to change.With HBO\u2019s programming slate growing and the battle between networks and streaming services getting only more intense, the network will soon start shifting some original scripted series to Monday nights.The prime-time expansion will begin with the limited series \u201cChernobyl,\u201d scheduled to premiere in May. Other shows appearing on Monday nights during the rest of the year include the final season of the drama \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d a limited series about Catherine the Great starring Helen Mirren and a new series adapted from Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials books. There will be two hours of prime-time scripted series on HBO most Monday nights.The reason, said Casey Bloys, the network\u2019s president of programming, is simple.\u201cThere\u2019s obviously only so many Sundays in a year,\u201d he said in an interview.Consider this statistic: This year, HBO will have 150 hours of original scripted content, a 50-percent increase from last year. Mr. Bloys said he anticipated that number would rise again in 2020.It\u2019s a volume play for a network whose biggest hit ever, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d is three months away from going off the air. Later this year, HBO will debut a much-anticipated drama based on the comic book series \u201cWatchmen\u201d and adapted by the \u201cLeftovers\u201d co-creator Damon Lindelof. The network also has science-fiction series in the pipeline \u2014 one from J. J. Abrams and another from the \u201cAvengers\u201d director Joss Whedon \u2014 in addition to a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d prequel.All of this is set against a backdrop in which its digital rivals like Netflix are spending with abandon and picking off big-name Hollywood talent like Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes. Apple is spending well over $1 billion on its own original content, which will roll out at some point this year.Though the expansion to Mondays is a big change for HBO, the move is largely symbolic. Most of HBO\u2019s viewership comes well after an episode\u2019s original air date.Five years ago, 35 percent of the total viewership of an episode of \u201cTrue Blood\u201d was logged on Sunday night, Mr. Bloys said. In 2017, only 10 percent of the viewership of \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d watched on Sunday night. This year, 18 percent of the viewership for \u201cTrue Detective\u201d has come from Sundays, a percentage that will decrease as more people watch the show on demand or on HBO Go or HBO Now.HBO has toyed with Monday nights before. In 2005, the final season of \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d was briefly moved to Monday nights before low ratings prompted executives to put it back on Sundays. The first season of \u201cEnlightened\u201d (2011), the third season of \u201cBored to Death\u201d (2011) and the second season of \u201cBig Love\u201d (2007) also aired on Monday nights. But those were exceptions.This time, HBO said, is different.\u201cIt\u2019s not: \u2018Let\u2019s see how it does!\u2019\u201d Mr. Bloys said. \u201cThis is our new normal.\u201dHe said he and Richard Plepler, the chief executive of HBO, had enacted a plan two years ago to increase the content the network made, a costly but vital move at a time of digital subscriptions and fierce competition from deep-pocketed streaming rivals like Netflix. It was a calculated bet: HBO had a deal in place to be bought by AT&T and hoped its corporate overlords would agree with their plan when they took over.\u201cThe good news is AT&T understood and endorsed the plan to spend money, and going forward into 2021, 2022, we\u2019re going to keep that level of programming up,\u201d Mr. Bloys said. He declined to say how much AT&T had invested in HBO since it became its corporate owner in June.Other premium cable channels with digital subscription services, like Showtime, have also emphasized the importance of having fresh original programming 52 weeks a year. That way, the thinking goes, when a major hit finishes a season, subscribers will have less reason to cancel their subscriptions.Even with additional content, HBO\u2019s original programming slate pales in comparison with Netflix. Last year, Netflix earned more Emmy nominations than HBO, snapping HBO\u2019s 17-year streak of garnering the most. They ultimately tied in  Emmy wins. But Mr. Bloys emphasized that HBO was not going to grow at the scale of Netflix.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about filling hours,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just about doing more HBO-level programming.\u201dHBO has long prized its ability to nurture new talent and be generous with established stars. Some of that talent, however, could perceive a move to Monday night as a signal that their shows are second tier.Mr. Bloys said all shows on the network would receive the same amount of marketing support no matter what night they aired.\u201cEvery show that we\u2019re putting on is of \u2014 and I\u2019m putting this in quotes \u2014 Sunday night-quality programming,\u201d he said. \u201cThat happened to be our flagship night for flagship shows. But all of these shows that we\u2019re programming are worthy of the HBO brand or we wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d"}, {"title": "In Virginia Governor\u2019s Turmoil, Democrats See an Agenda at Risk", "category": "Politics", "id": "00cf5687-d1b2-4cba-a48e-829b952a788f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/us/politics/northam-governor-virginia.html", "publishdate": 20190203, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/03/us/04NORTHAM/04NORTHAM-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "content": "The refusal by Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, to resign after the revelation of a racist photograph is threatening his party\u2019s political fortunes in Virginia, where Democrats are on the brink of consolidating power after a decade-long rise in the once-conservative state.With Mr. Northam\u2019s turmoil erupting during a legislative session in an election year, Democrats and Republicans said Sunday that his fragile hold on power risked his party\u2019s policy ambitions and its aspirations for this fall, when control of both the state\u2019s legislative chambers is expected to be bitterly and closely contested.\u201cYou can\u2019t govern without a mandate, and all you\u2019re going to do is make things worse for the state,\u201d said Representative A. Donald McEachin, a Democrat who served alongside Mr. Northam in the Virginia Senate.Mr. Northam met with some of his staff members on Sunday night, prompting speculation that he might announce his resignation during the Super Bowl. Most of the people he met with told him that resigning was the way to clear his name, according to a state Democrat briefed on the meeting by an attendee.Both chambers of the Legislature are scheduled to meet on Monday morning for sessions that could bring fresh condemnations of the governor. As of Sunday evening, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who would succeed Mr. Northam if he resigned, had not been notified that the governor was stepping down.Mr. Northam\u2019s troubles began on Friday with the surfacing of a photograph on his medical school yearbook page, which showed a person in blackface posing with another in a Ku Klux Klan robe. The governor at first acknowledged that he was one of the figures in the image, and then denied it on Saturday, all while drawing widespread calls for his resignation. Until this episode, Democrats appeared to be on a steady roll in Virginia, a state that had increasingly become a source of strength for the party in major elections.[Read: Ralph Northam rose to power quickly. His fall might be even faster.]Since 2008, when Barack Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate in more than four decades to carry the state, Virginia has shifted steadily leftward. For the last decade, both of the state\u2019s senators in Washington have been Democrats. And more recently, the party has gained greater sway at the Capitol in Richmond.Two years ago, Democrats picked up 15 seats in the House of Delegates, where they had been locked out of the majority for more than two decades. They are now two seats away from control in both chambers. The biggest prize in controlling the statehouse would be the power, under current law, to draw congressional and legislative districts after the 2020 census.More power in the Legislature has already translated into significant policy wins for Democrats. Since Mr. Northam was elected in 2017, the party has achieved long-prized goals, like the expansion of Medicaid, and seized new credit for the state\u2019s economic growth.And this week is arguably among the most crucial of the year\u2019s 46-day legislative session, with an important deadline for bills to advance. The speaker of the House of Delegates, Kirk Cox, and other Republican legislators warned that Mr. Northam\u2019s \u201cability to lead and govern is permanently impaired.\u201dEven to his Democratic allies, Mr. Northam now seems hobbled.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to work as one unit to move your commonwealth forward, and he\u2019s just not going to have that ability to do it,\u201d Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat who preceded Mr. Northam as governor, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201dMr. Northam\u2019s difficulties can be traced, in part, to his shifting accounts over the photograph, published in a 1984 yearbook for the Eastern Virginia Medical School, which said on Sunday that it would investigate how such \u201cunacceptable photos\u201d came to be published.First, Mr. Northam apologized Friday night \u201cfor the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo.\u201d Then, on Saturday, he declared with certainty that neither person in the photograph was him. But he also acknowledged a separate episode in which he darkened his face with shoe polish for a Michael Jackson costume at a dance contest in 1984.Mr. Northam maintained over the weekend that, for the time being, he commanded enough influence to govern the state of about 8.5 million people.\u201cI plan to continue to lead,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we get to the point where we feel that we\u2019re not effective, that we\u2019re not efficient, not only for our caucuses, but the Commonwealth of Virginia, then we will revisit this and make decisions.\u201dOn Sunday, one of Mr. Northam\u2019s few remaining public allies, former Representative Jim Moran, said he saw a \u201crush to judgment\u201d at work against the 59-year-old governor.VideoThe governor and attorney general acknowledged wearing blackface in the past, and the lieutenant governor faced an allegation of sexual assault.CreditCreditParker Michels-Boyce for The New York Times\u201cI think there is an issue of redemption,\u201d Mr. Moran, who represented Northern Virginia in Congress for 24 years, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201dBut Mr. Northam is still in an uncomfortable spot, the third Southern governor in the last decade to try to hold onto his job in spite of a serious personal scandal. That approach, on display in South Carolina in 2009 and in Alabama beginning in 2016, has had mixed results: One governor eventually resigned, and the other was elected to Congress.Mr. Northam retreated on Sunday to his native Eastern Shore, where he worshiped at the church he has long attended, First Baptist Church Capeville.The Rev. Kelvin F. Jones, who said he had told the governor on Saturday that he needed \u201cto be in a place where you get loved on,\u201d summoned Mr. Northam and his wife to the front of the sanctuary. Dozens of parishioners surrounded the couple, who bowed their heads, their faces stoic, and swayed to background music.\u201cWe circle and pray for them,\u201d said the pastor, who opened the service with the biblical account of Jesus Christ and the question of who should be the first to cast a stone.Before and after Mr. Northam\u2019s visit to the church, doubts over his political fate swirled on the airwaves and throughout Virginia.\u201cAt this stage, I just don\u2019t see how he can be effective,\u201d said Mark Keam, a Democratic member of the House of Delegates from Fairfax County, near Washington.A spokeswoman for House Democrats, Kathryn Gilley, said members were continuing to demand Mr. Northam\u2019s immediate resignation.\u201cWhat is most important right now is completing the business of the 2019 General Assembly session,\u201d she said.Mr. McAuliffe, under whom Mr. Northam was lieutenant governor, predicted that his successor would \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and resign \u201crelatively soon.\u201dIf he does not, the governor will leave lawmakers and other state leaders with an unsettling dilemma, and scholars and Virginia officials have been studying the State Constitution and its provisions to oust a sitting governor.Virginia\u2019s Constitution allows the impeachments of governors for \u201coffending against the Commonwealth by malfeasance in office, corruption, neglect of duty or other high crime or misdemeanor.\u201dThe Constitution also has a second, equally disruptive mechanism that is similar to the United States Constitution\u2019s 25th Amendment and allows a governor to be removed if he is \u201cunable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\u201d A governor may contest such a move and seek reinstatement.Mr. McAuliffe said on Sunday that he did not anticipate any proceedings like impeachment, even as Mr. Northam seemed to make no move toward an exit.\u201cI know Ralph very well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not come to that. And if Ralph is watching this today, I know how much he loves this Commonwealth of Virginia, and you\u2019ve got to make the right decision. You\u2019ve got to make the right moral decision.\u201dMr. Keam, the state legislator from Fairfax County, suggested that the governor should not conflate redemption with sustained service. Mr. Northam, Mr. Keam said, had a duty to remove \u201cthe dark cloud\u201d over the state government.\u201cEverybody deserves forgiveness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut nobody deserves to be governor.\u201d"}, {"title": "The \u2018Monster\u2019 Texas Oil Field That Made the U.S. a Star in the World Market", "category": "Business", "id": "42b5b3e4-feb7-4477-bb27-8a2fa327a40b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/business/energy-environment/texas-permian-field-oil.html", "publishdate": 20190203, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/29/business/00permian07/merlin_149933091_5dd0d7d4-6d4b-44a8-b5a8-38284c113118-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "MIDLAND, Tex. \u2014 In a global collapse of oil prices five years ago, scores of American oil companies went bankrupt. But one field withstood the onslaught, and even thrived: the Permian Basin, straddling Texas and New Mexico.A combination of technical innovation, aggressive investing and copious layers of oil-rich shale have transformed the Permian, once considered a worn-out patch, into the world\u2019s second-most-productive oil field.And this transformation has apparently inoculated Texas against its traditional economic enemy, the boom-and-bust cycle pegged to oil prices.Even now, with prices still far below their peak, the Permian is bursting with production and exploration, and the biggest concern is how to create more capacity to get all that oil to market.The shale-drilling frenzy in the Permian has enabled the United States not only to reduce crude-oil imports, but even to become a major exporter for the first time in half a century. Its bounty has also empowered the United States diplomatically, allowing it to impose sanctions on Iran and Venezuela without worrying much about increasing gasoline prices. Mounting Texas crude exports have pressured global oil prices down, and are a major reason that Russia and Saudi Arabia recently cut their own production to push oil prices back up.\u201cOPEC producers never thought the Permian could be the next star world producer,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Ortiz of Ecuador, a former secretary-general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. \u201cThey never thought one field \u2014 one, and not a country \u2014 could actually be the monster field of their imaginations.\u201dLast year alone, the Permian\u2019s production rose by a million barrels a day, and it could surpass the Ghawar field in Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest, within three years. Now producing four million barrels a day, the Permian generates more oil than any of the 14 members of OPEC except Saudi Arabia and Iraq.ImageFloorhands work on an drilling rig contracted to Shell in West Texas. Shell produces 145,000 barrels of oil a day in the Permian and projects it can increase production to 200,000 barrels a day by 2020.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesImageRon Dube, Shell\u2019s Permian operations manager. Shell has made clear that it aims to continue to expand in the Permian, where big companies have been snapping up smaller ones.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesAll told, domestic oil production increased by two million barrels a day last year, for a record of 11.9 million barrels, making the United States the world\u2019s top producer.Permian production has quadrupled over the last eight years, in contrast with the decline of most other established oil fields, for several reasons.Companies found ways to lower exploration and production costs in tapping the Permian\u2019s accommodating shale. New technologies for drilling and hydraulic fracturing helped bring the break-even price for the best wells from over $60 a barrel to as low as $33.The Permian, as vast as South Dakota, is distinct from other shale fields because of its enormous size, the thickness of its multiple shale layers \u2014 some as fat as 1,000 feet \u2014 and its proximity to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. Some shale fields produce too much natural gas, which is worth less than oil. Others have uneven layers of rock difficult to drill through. The Permian is rich in oil, and its shales are relatively easy to tap with today\u2019s rigs.Today the biggest risk, at least for producers, is that too much output might drive down prices too much and jeopardize their profitability. They could also prompt another round of aggressive actions from OPEC and its new ally, Russia.\u201cIf U.S. production grows another two million barrels a day, we could take market share, but how long would OPEC allow that to happen?\u201d said Scott D. Sheffield, chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major Permian producer. \u201cYou could have another price war.\u201dThat may be inevitable.As many as 15 oil and gas pipelines serving the Permian are expected to be completed by the middle of 2020, potentially increasing exports from the Gulf of Mexico fourfold to eight million barrels a day after 2021, according to a recent Morningstar Commodities Research report.ImageA Shell central processing facility, where crude oil and natural gas is first processed. Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP and Shell have been making big new investments in the Permian despite uncertainty about prices.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesThe Permian has been producing oil for a century, and provided much of the fuel the allies needed to win World War II. By 2008, it was a field in steep decline. Many major oil companies left, selling their land to smaller ones for a song.But as the big companies looked for fields deep under oceans and in the Arctic, independents like Concho Resources and Parsley Energy pioneered shale drilling here, giving the field new life.When oil prices took a dive, the upstarts experimented. They drilled longer wells and spaced them closer together in a zipper design to penetrate more shale. They tinkered with their formulas of chemicals and sands that they blast through the rocks, and they used computer technology to steer drill bits more accurately.\u201cOPEC changed the price of poker and the Permian had the best hand,\u201d said Dale Redman, chief executive of ProPetro, one of the basin\u2019s biggest fracking service companies. \u201cThey unleashed our creativity. They forced us to do things better and cheaper.\u201dProPetro laid off 250 workers three years ago, after oil prices fell below $30 a barrel. But the company has since hired back those employees and added hundreds more, including 600 when they completed an acquisition on Jan. 1.What makes the payroll additions all the more remarkable is that they come in the wake of the most recent downturn in oil prices \u2014 from $76 a barrel in early October to $42 in late December before recovering to more than $55 on Friday.Despite the ups and downs, there are signs of expansion everywhere in the West Texas desert. Trucks line up at dawn for half a mile to pick up sand at local mines for the day\u2019s fracking jobs. Competition for workers is so fierce that fast-food restaurants have blinking signs advertising their salaries. Anadarko Petroleum and Plains All American Pipeline are constructing new regional offices to add to those built in recent years for Chevron and Apache.ImagePump jacks, a common sight throughout West Texas, are painted on a wall in downtown Midland.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesImageAn exhibit at the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum in Midland. The region has produced oil for nearly a century.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesMotel rates and apartment rents have climbed so much that trailer parks are the only option for many workers. But few seem to mind.\u201cI will have work here forever,\u201d said Mike Wilkinson, a truck driver who came from Dallas a year ago and moved into a trailer with his teenage daughter. \u201cAs hard a place as this is to look at, they are going to need guys like me to move equipment around here for years to come.\u201dImageMike Wilkinson, a truck driver, outside his trailer in Midland. \u201cI will have work here forever,\u201d said Mr. Wilkinson, who moved from Dallas a year ago with his teenage daughter.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesMr. Wilkinson has reason for enthusiasm, given the giant new investments that Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP and Shell have begun to make here despite all the price uncertainty.With a major acquisition in New Mexico last year, Exxon Mobil became the most active driller in the basin, and projects that it will increase production fivefold by 2025. Also growing rapidly here, Chevron estimates that one in six of every barrels it produces globally will come from the Permian by 2021.After regaining a foothold in the Permian last year, BP is expected to invest heavily, contributing to a total investment of more than $10 billion by the major oil companies here this year, according to IHS Markit, the energy consultant.Royal Dutch Shell is just beginning to catch up, after buying acreage from Chesapeake seven years ago. It already has 1,300 wells that produce 145,000 barrels of oil a day and associated gas, a 200 percent increase since January 2017. The company projects it can increase production to 200,000 barrels a day by 2020.Shell\u2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said Thursday that his company was seeking to increase its footprint in the Permian, the most recent sign that big oil companies will continue to snap up smaller ones.\u201cFor Shell, the Permian is absolutely critical,\u201d said Gretchen Watkins, president of Shell Oil. \u201cThe Permian is massive; it\u2019s a game changer for U.S. shale. It is the powerhouse field.\u201dBut the output of shale wells declines quickly, making the drilling here a never-ending treadmill. And that has been a challenge for the small companies that have been the innovators here but are now facing demands from investors to show financial discipline.Typical of the smaller producers is Parsley Energy, one of the most active drillers in the basin with some of the most productive wells. Its share price was cut in half over the last two years as it outspent its cash flow grabbing land and ramping up production.ImageTechnicians at work in a hydraulic fracturing operation at a Parsley Energy site.

Because of last year\u2019s decline in oil prices, Parsley is reducing spending on exploration and production this year by $300 million.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesLate last year, as oil prices fell, Parsley changed course. It is reducing spending on exploration and production this year by $300 million. It decommissioned two of its 16 rigs late last year, and two more in January.\u201cWe all have to be prepared,\u201d said Matt Gallagher, Parsley\u2019s chief executive, for a six-month slump in prices. \u201cWe\u2019re one Twitter message away from a deal with Iran and $40 oil.\u201dThe multinationals have the wherewithal to stick by their aggressive development plans and take a longer view.They bring an arsenal of tools that the smaller companies lack. With their size and reach, they can make the best deals for equipment like drill rigs and fracking services. Many have their own pipelines, refineries and global trading personnel to sell their oil for the highest price.In January, Chevron agreed to acquire a refinery in Pasadena, Tex., from the Brazilian company Petrobras for $350 million to refine more products coming from the Permian. The announcement came only days after Exxon Mobil announced a major expansion of its Beaumont, Tex., refinery to process more local crude.The major companies also aim to cut production costs even further with increasingly sophisticated applications of artificial intelligence. Shell, for instance, has developed algorithms to replicate and standardize the most effective drilling and fracking methods worldwide.\u201cWe are not here through one boom and bust,\u201d said Amir Gerges, Shell\u2019s Permian general manager. \u201cWe are here developing a generational resource.\u201d"}, {"title": "Ralph Northam Rose Quickly to Become Virginia Governor.

At one point, he seemed on the verge of demonstrating Michael Jackson\u2019s moonwalk \u2014 which he said he once did in a dance contest while wearing shoe polish to darken his face \u2014 until his wife, Pam, who was standing next to him, whispered, \u201cInappropriate circumstances.\u201dMr. Northam was recruited into politics in 2007 by Levar Stoney, then an official with the state Democratic Party and now the mayor of Richmond. He gave Mr. Northam the nickname \u201cBlue Crab\u201d because of his roots on the state\u2019s Eastern Shore, a center of crab and oyster fishing and farming. Mr. Stoney, an African-American, was among the Democratic leaders who called for the governor to quit.Mr. Northam was raised on an inlet of Chesapeake Bay, the son of a judge and heir to a long lineage in the racially diverse Accomack County. Today, the small town where he grew up, Onancock, is reached past cotton fields, barns with fallen roofs and the rusty rails of a moribund railroad. Antique stores and real estate offices line the handful of commercial blocks along Market Street.The governor attended the Virginia Military Institute for his undergraduate studies and then Eastern Virginia Medical School, which is in Norfolk.At medical school \u2014 where the 1984 yearbook included the photograph that now threatens Mr. Northam\u2019s career \u2014 the future governor sometimes seemed \u201ca little insecure,\u201d Dr. Rob Marsh, a roommate, recalled on Saturday.Dr. Marsh, who lived with Mr. Northam for two years, said he had no recollection of the image or any event where it might have been taken. It shows two people, one dressed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan and another wearing blackface, and appears on Mr. Northam\u2019s personal yearbook page.\u201cI don\u2019t recall that event happening at all, or that picture or anything about that picture,\u201d Dr. Marsh said. \u201cI\u2019m stunned by it. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to me at all \u2014 he never had a racist comment or ethnic slur or even joking.\u201dVideoThe governor and attorney general acknowledged wearing blackface in the past, and the lieutenant governor faced an allegation of sexual assault.CreditCreditParker Michels-Boyce for The New York TimesMr. Northam initially acknowledged that it was him in the photograph when it first surfaced on Friday, but he reversed course the next day, when he said that after examining it more closely he had concluded it was not in fact him. He also revealed that he had darkened his face for the Michael Jackson costume the same year, after he had joined the Army.[Read about other politicians who have gotten in hot water over racially offensive images.]Mr. Northam served eight years as an Army doctor, including treating the wounded from Operation Desert Storm at a medical center in Germany, and was a chief resident at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.He returned to Norfolk to raise two children with his wife and build a career as a pediatric neurologist, with a particular interest in epilepsy. He also served as a volunteer director of a children\u2019s hospice.Democrats who urged him to run for office in 2007 overlooked his history of twice voting for George W. Bush for president, and as an elected official Mr. Northam has been consistently liberal, often a leader, on social issues.In the Virginia Senate, he led an effort to ban smoking in restaurants. He later rose on the Senate floor to explain that a Republican bill requiring an ultrasound before an abortion would subject women to invasive \u201ctransvaginal\u201d probes. The phrase provoked widespread criticism and mockery of the bill, which Republicans passed after revising it to allow the choice of an external ultrasound instead.Both issues raised Mr. Northam\u2019s profile. In 2013, he was elected lieutenant governor on a ticket headed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a more flamboyant and nationally known figure.The election season of 2017 thrust the state\u2019s bitter, never fully buried racial history to the forefront. Torch-carrying white nationalists marched in Charlottesville to protest the removal of Confederate monuments, and after the violent death of a counterprotester, President Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d on both sides.By then, Mr. Northam had invoked his medical expertise in assessing the president\u2019s psychiatric state.\u201cBeing a pediatrician has taught me to listen carefully,\u201d he said in a primary advertisement that began with footage of him examining a boy with a stethoscope and culminated with him declaring, \u201cNow, I\u2019m listening carefully to Donald Trump, and I think he\u2019s a narcissistic maniac.\u201dWhile running for governor, Mr. Northam learned that his ancestors had been slave owners. \u201cMy family\u2019s complicated story is similar to Virginia\u2019s complex history,\u201d he told The Richmond Times-Dispatch. \u201cWe\u2019re a progressive state, but we once had the largest number of slaves in the union.\u201dMr. Northam\u2019s Republican opponent, Ed Gillespie, closed his campaign by raising fears of violent Latino gangs and accusing Mr. Northam of backing \u201csanctuary\u201d cities. He lost by nine percentage points, which was widely seen as a repudiation of the racially charged politics of the Trump era.Virginia governors, who cannot seek consecutive terms, often move to the United States Senate or consider presidential runs, but Mr. Northam was thought to have reached his highest office even before the current scandal.Still, he accomplished the major Democratic policy goal of expanding Medicaid benefits, which had eluded Mr. McAuliffe over his four years in office. Mr. Northam also helped lure Amazon to Northern Virginia as one of two sites for its second headquarters, which will bring thousands of well-paid tech jobs to the area.And as of this weekend, his longtime medical practice still listed him among its providers.Asked near the end of the news conference on Saturday how the scandal might affect his medical practice, especially with patients of color, Mr. Northam replied, \u201cI have taken care of literally thousands of children and their families, and I can tell you I treat everyone the same way. Nobody has ever thought or accused me of being racist, and if and when I practice again, I will continue that same direction.\u201d"}, {"title": "Big Tech Is No Longer Carrying the Stock Market", "category": "Business", "id": "2d5f52dd-4345-4b24-8c01-b2ecf710d655", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/business/dealbook/stock-market-technology.html", "publishdate": 20190203, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/02/business/dealbook/02db-techstocks1/02db-techstocks1-articleLarge.png", "content": "One by one, the concerns that have hung over the stock market have faded. Fears that the United States economy would dip into a recession this year have eased. The Federal Reserve seems to be finished raising interest rates for the foreseeable future, and optimism has increased that the United States and China could end their trade war.But if the January snap back (it was the best start to a year for stocks in decades, after the worst December for stocks in an even longer period) is to sustain itself, big technology companies likely will have to lead the way. So far this year, they have not done that. For much of the past decade, the fate of the stock market has been tied to the performance of a handful of the largest tech companies: Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix led the market from one record to the next.By the end of August, their sway over the direction of the S&P 500 exceeded all but two of the index\u2019s 11 sector groupings. As the index pushed to a record high last summer, the rise in those six companies\u2019 shares accounted for half of its gain. They led on the way down too, dragging the broader market lower over the final three months of 2018 and nearly ending the longest bull market on record.So it\u2019s notable, then, that as the S&P 500 rallied nearly 8 percent in January, the big technology stocks accounted for just 17 percent of the benchmark\u2019s rise, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. What happened? The companies have faced a fundamental question since late last year: Could they continue to pull in new users and generate more sales in a slowing global economy? Sales growth had begun to slow in the second half of 2018 and earnings updates in January haven\u2019t fully resolved investors\u2019 concerns about their trajectory. \u201cThis is the first quarter in my memory that technology has on the whole had worse metrics than the S&P 500,\u201d said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, referring to the earnings and revenue growth rate of big technology companies.After Apple warned of diminishing demand for new iPhones in China earlier this year, its forecast for the current quarter wasn\u2019t as dire as many on Wall Street had feared. The stock has gained 7.7 percent since then. Still, the iPhone maker reported a 15 percent drop in revenue, including a 27 percent decline in China, and its results indicated a difficult road ahead. Its stock remains nearly 30 percent below its peak.Amazon reported record profits and revenue. But its shares were down 5.4 percent Friday in part because revenue from online shopping slowed and the growth of Prime memberships appeared to have plateaued.Microsoft shares have fallen 3.4 percent since it reported on Wednesday. Revenue at the software giant has surged in recent years as its bet on cloud computing has paid off, but there were continued signs that that acceleration could be tapering off.Facebook, whose shares were the most battered among the big tech companies last year, was perhaps the bright spot this earnings season. Despite a string of scandals, the social network generated record revenue and profit last year. Its shares have jumped 10.5 percent since Wednesday.Netflix also said revenue would grow more slowly this quarter. Its stock is down almost 3.8 percent since it reported on Jan. 17.There is a big caveat to all the hand-wringing about slowing growth: All five companies still generate huge revenue. And should Beijing and Washington reach an agreement in the trade war, sales could pick up if the global economy, particularly China\u2019s, begins to gain speed. \u201cThere was real concern that tech was the canary in the coal mine of what would be a very dark 2019,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities covering technology companies. \u201cThus far a lot of those fears are proving overblown. That could set the stage for tech to make new highs this year, depending on what happens with China.\u201d"}, {"title": "On Politics: Virginia Governor\u2019s Racist Yearbook Photo Revealed", "category": "Politics", "id": "35a4ae56-99c6-42e5-a2eb-8c0d7dc9a577", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/us/politics/on-politics-virginia-governor-racist-photo.html", "publishdate": 20190204, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Monday morning.

But that is what has happened these past few months, as the United States has confronted Chinese companies accused of stealing technology and violating economic sanctions laws.At the center of the controversy: Huawei. The Justice Department has unsealed two indictments against the Chinese technology company and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. Both are accused of a long-running scheme to steal trade secrets and conduct business with Iranian companies in violation of economic sanctions against the country.But can the Justice Department actually obtain convictions that will dissuade Chinese companies from stealing intellectual property?Huawei Under ScrutinyIn the first indictment, filed in Seattle, Huawei and its American subsidiary are accused of stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile. The telecommunications company sued Huawei in 2014, and that civil case became the foundation for the Justice Department\u2019s charges of conspiracy, attempted theft of trade secrets and wire fraud. Prosecutors also added an obstruction-of-justice charge, which involves both the civil case and the grand jury investigation.The trade secrets statute makes it a federal crime to steal or obtain by fraud a trade secret related to any product or service. The law defines a \u201ctrade secret\u201d broadly to include \u201call forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic or engineering information,\u201d including intangible products like software.The second indictment, filed in Brooklyn, accused Ms. Meng and Huawei of defrauding four banks into clearing transactions with Iran through a subsidiary, Skycom, with which the parent company claimed it had severed ties. As with the Seattle charges, federal prosecutors also accused the company of trying to impede the investigation, by lying to the federal government, as well as concealing and destroying evidence, which included moving potential witnesses back to China, where they would be beyond the reach of prosecutors.The Justice Department seeks the extradition of Ms. Meng, who was arrested in Canada, to the United States to face charges that she participated in a fraudulent scheme to mislead banks, which included lying about the reasons one bank decided to sever ties with Huawei.A Broader BattleBut the indictments against Huawei are just another step in the pursuit of Chinese companies that have violated United States laws.In November, the Justice Department announced that it was devoting resources to a new \u201cChina Initiative\u201d to identify cases involving theft of trade secrets by Chinese companies.The same month, prosecutors unveiled criminal charges in San Jose, Calif., against a Chinese government-owned company, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit; a Taiwanese company, United Microelectronics; and three Taiwanese nationals. The case involves theft of trade secrets from Micron Technology related to DRAM computer memory chips, which can be found in almost all modern computerized devices.The Justice Department also filed a civil complaint in the same case, seeking to prevent the companies from transferring any technology involving the memory chips outside the United States.The Corporate Death Penalty?The Justice Department has obtained significant penalties from parties that have violated economic sanctions laws, including a nearly $9 billion payment from BNP Paribas after it pleaded guilty to processing billions of dollars of transactions in violation of sanctions imposed on Cuba, Iran and Sudan.If Huawei\u2019s involvement in trade secret theft and sanctions violations reaches to the highest levels, including Ms. Meng, then under a provision of the federal sentencing guidelines a court could determine that the company was \u201coperated primarily for a criminal purpose or primarily by criminal means.\u201d That would authorize a penalty \u201csufficient to divest the organization of all its net assets\u201d \u2014 the corporate death penalty. That is unlikely, but it is the ultimate power that federal prosecutors have to stop a company from committing crimes.The use of criminal laws to pursue Chinese companies is a new front in the continuing battle over theft of intellectual property and violation of American sanctions. But whether companies based in China are concerned about possible criminal charges remains an open question, because prosecutors could have a difficult time collecting any fines against them. So the goal of keeping technology safe from theft is unlikely to abate \u2014 making it a point of contention between the United States and China for some time to come."}, {"title": "Alphabet Is in a Tumultuous Time, but the Business Keeps Booming", "category": "Business", "id": "c2d1eaf6-6e67-4ccf-80ba-cf3d241b517e", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/technology/alpahbet-quarterly-earnings.html", "publishdate": 20190204, "imageurl": "", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, had a tumultuous 2018, with employee revolts, antitrust fines, tough privacy regulation in Europe and heightened political scrutiny in Washington.Through it all, the company managed to produce strong financial results with the numbing consistency of the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.On Monday, Alphabet said revenue rose 22 percent to $39.27 billion in its most recent quarter, while profits swung to $8.95 billion. Last year, Alphabet reported a loss after it took a $9.9 billion charge for the repatriation of foreign earnings after changes in the tax code.Alphabet\u2019s financial consistency is easily explained. Google owns the internet\u2019s ultimate beachfront property, the starting point for a lot of internet activity, whether it\u2019s someone looking for entertainment on YouTube or hunting for product information on the Google search engine.While Facebook and Amazon are formidable competitors, Google is the top destination for marketers looking to reach consumers online. It accounted for 31 percent of digital advertising around the world last year, according to the research firm eMarketer.Google said advertising revenue from \u201cGoogle properties\u201d like search and YouTube was $27.02 billion in the fourth quarter, up 22 percent from a year earlier.The company\u2019s ad business is shifting as more consumers use mobile devices for access to the internet. Alphabet reported a 66 percent increase in clicks on its ads, although the revenue per click fell 29 percent during the quarter. In other words, people are looking at Google\u2019s ads more often, though the price of those ads is dropping.Mobile ads cost less than ads viewed on desktop devices. But the company has offset that decline because search ads take up more screen space on mobile phones \u2014 making it more likely users will click on them.Alphabet\u2019s quarterly results beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates, but the company\u2019s share price was down about 2.6 percent in after-hours trading on Monday.If there is a cause for concern, it is Google\u2019s rising costs. In order to maintain a foothold on smartphones, Google pays smartphone manufacturers like Apple billions of dollars to be the default search engine on their devices.Alphabet is also spending more to acquire content for YouTube, market new hardware products and build new data centers and other sorts of technology infrastructure.On a conference call with analysts on Monday, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said investments in building and expanding data centers were \u201can important long-term investment\u201d for future computing needs as the company rolled out new technologies like artificial intelligence.In 2018, Google\u2019s costs and expenses grew 30 percent, outpacing the 23 percent increase in revenue. The company\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled in the past year to $25.14 billion.Alphabet has continued to hire aggressively. It had 98,771 employees as of Dec. 31, compared with 80,110 workers a year earlier.Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer, has pushed the company to be more mindful of its costs \u2014 calling for more fiscal discipline at units like X, Google\u2019s research and development arm. But her cost-cutting push has raised concerns among Google\u2019s vocal employees.Last week, Google had to address a spreadsheet created by its human resources department in 2016 \u2014 the year after Ms. Porat joined the company \u2014 that raised the possibility of cost-cutting measures like promoting fewer employees and scaling back some of the company\u2019s famous workplace perks.At a weekly employee meeting, Google management responded to sharp criticism from employees about the spreadsheet, saying that it was a brainstorming exercise and that most of the proposals were never considered."}, {"title": "Once the \u2018Bond King,\u2019 Bill Gross Is Retiring, His Star Dimmed", "category": "Business", "id": "01ba76a1-38b6-4050-82f7-7a6b7f352b41", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/business/bond-king-bill-gross-retirement.html", "publishdate": 20190204, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/business/05STRATEGIES/merlin_147136203_44087ac7-680e-4a03-a7bc-676749ddd3d9-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "William H. Gross, the \u201cBond King,\u201d is going into retirement.Mr. Gross, who co-founded the investment firm Pimco in 1971 and built it into a $2 trillion colossus, entertained investors with quirky pronouncements over many decades. He left unceremoniously in a nasty dispute in 2014, and joined Janus Henderson Investments, which announced his retirement on Monday.\u201cI\u2019ve had a wonderful ride for over 40 years in my career,\u201d he said in a statement, \u201ctrying at all times to put client interests first while inventing and reinventing active bond management along the way.\u201dAt Pimco, Mr. Gross controlled more bond money than anyone in the world. He advised the Treasury on the role of subprime mortgage bonds in the dark days of the financial crisis, and his colorful metaphors often enlivened the otherwise dreary discourse about fixed-income investing.In 2011, for example, he told me that investors were like complacent frogs sitting in a pot of slowly heating water.\u201cBond investors are receiving almost nothing for their money, and the situation is getting worse and worse,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve gotten used to it. They don\u2019t realize how bad it is. And before they know it, well, they\u2019ll be cooked.\u201dHis utterances in those days often moved markets, and his early-morning yoga ritual at Newport Beach, Calif., was widely chronicled.Early in his tenure at Pimco, Mr. Gross was known as a skillful bond trader who pioneered the use of mathematical models to eke out steady profits. He also gained fame as an analyst of broad economic trends, which he used to inform the firm\u2019s investment strategy.He had a homespun style that he used in books aimed at a popular audience, like \u201cEverything You\u2019ve Heard About Investing Is Wrong!: How to Profit in the Coming Post-Bull Markets.\u201d In that 1997 book, he said the solid returns produced by bonds would shield investors from the disappointments of the busts that inevitably followed boom markets in stocks.But Mr. Gross has not been a dominant figure in finance since he was forced out of Pimco amid accusations that he had mismanaged the firm, where he was a co-chief investment officer. Mr. Gross and Pimco settled a lawsuit over the dispute in 2017.While he set high expectations for himself, his second career at Janus Henderson was not impressive.In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, he said explicitly that he viewed himself as competing directly with the fund managers at Pimco. \u201cMy whole evening is dependent on whether I beat them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see, I have to prove it all over again. Every day.\u201dYet a quick look at the numbers suggests he may have been disheartened by his recent performance. Pimco Total Return, the fund he once ruled, returned 2.54 percent, annualized, in the three years through Friday, trouncing the paltry 0.95 percent returned by his new fund, Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained.Through most of Mr. Gross\u2019s time at Pimco, however, his performance was splendid. In the 15 years through February 2014, for example, Pimco Total Return posted an annualized gain of 6.68 percent, versus 5.19 percent for the average intermediate-term bond fund. And his risk-adjusted returns over the long term were much better than average.Over the past 20 years, Janus Henderson said, Mr. Gross had donated $800 million to various philanthropies. He will continue to manage his own assets, which are considerable, and those of his family foundation, which is valued at $390 million.Although he was often revered as something of an oracle in his years at Pimco, his frequent pronouncements on the state of the markets and the economy were not always on the mark, even in his heyday.In May 2009, when the stock market was just entering a bull market that has lasted nearly 10 years, Mr. Gross told me that the market rested on precarious foundations. He warned against \u201cjumping into a stock market that\u2019s 35 percent higher than it was three months ago.\u201dHe predicted moderate \u201csingle-digit returns\u201d for the next decade, well short of the double-digit returns that stock investors actually received."}, {"title": "Lt.

Gov. Justin Fairfax of Virginia emphatically denied on Monday a woman\u2019s claim that he sexually assaulted her in 2004, suggesting at one point that Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s supporters were trying to block his ascent to the governorship at a moment when Mr. Northam is besieged by demands that he resign over charges of racism.\u201cDoes anybody think it\u2019s any coincidence that on the eve of potentially my being elevated that that\u2019s when this smear comes out?\u201d Mr. Fairfax told reporters surrounding him in the rotunda of the state Capitol about whether he believes Mr. Northam, a fellow Democrat, was behind the accusation\u2019s coming to light.He softened his suggestion as he left the Capitol Monday night, telling reporters he had \u201cno indication\u201d that Mr. Northam was responsible.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]But in the same conversation, Mr. Fairfax hinted that Levar Stoney, the mayor of Richmond and a potential rival to Mr. Fairfax for the 2021 Democratic nomination for governor, may have played a role \u2014 praising the acumen of a reporter who inquired whether Mr. Stoney might have been responsible.Asked if he had any involvement in leaking the claims of assault, which first surfaced Sunday night on a right-wing website, Mr. Stoney said, \u201cThe insinuation is 100 percent not true, and frankly it\u2019s offensive.\u201dJust hours after The Washington Post published a story on Monday outlining the woman\u2019s allegation \u2014 that Mr. Fairfax assaulted her soon after they had met in Boston at the Democratic National Convention \u2014 the lieutenant governor said that he and the woman had had what he called \u201ca 100 percent consensual\u201d sexual encounter.\u201cWe hit it off, she was very interested in me, and so eventually, at one point, we ended up going to my hotel room,\u201d Mr. Fairfax said, recounting in a measured voice what he said had happened in 2004.Mr. Fairfax asserted that the woman had subsequently called him and said she wanted him to meet her mother. He said he had no documentary evidence of any further conversations after their sexual encounter in 2004, when he was working as the personal aide to John Edwards, then a senator from North Carolina and the Democratic vice-presidential candidate that year.Asked if he had seen her since the time in his hotel room, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe so.\u201dThe New York Times has reached out to intermediaries for the woman who made the allegation, but they did not immediately comment on Monday.An adviser to Mr. Northam, asked Monday if the embattled governor had been behind the revelation of the assault allegations, denied any responsibility and said the Northam camp did not have the capacity to plot such a move at a moment when Mr. Northam is struggling to retain his job.The accusations against Mr. Fairfax threw Virginia\u2019s government into a deeper state of chaos three days after an image surfaced from Mr. Northam\u2019s medical school yearbook page showing a man in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan robe. The governor, after initially acknowledging he was one of the men in the 1984 photo, is now denying that he was and refusing insistent calls from state and national Democrats that he resign.Even though Mr. Northam admitted Saturday at his own news conference to once darkening his face with shoe polish for a Michael Jackson costume at a dance party, his advisers said Monday that he would not step down, and his chief of staff told other aides at a staff meeting that they owed it to Mr. Northam to remain with him for now, according to a Democrat briefed on the conversation.For his part, Mr. Fairfax noted that he was in \u201ca unique position\u201d and wanted to remain \u201ccircumspect\u201d about whether he thought the governor should quit.But he was less restrained in claiming that there was a \u201cmanipulation\u201d effort to derail his career in elective politics, which began with his election as lieutenant governor in 2017.\u201cIt\u2019s such a shame that this has been weaponized and used as a smear, because this is a very real issue,\u201d he said of sexual assault.Mr. Fairfax ran separately from Mr. Northam during the Democratic primaries for lieutenant governor and governor; unlike candidates in some other states, Mr. Northam did not choose Mr. Fairfax as his running mate.After Mr. Fairfax spoke to the news media for just over 10 minutes, the clerk of the State Senate, Susan Clarke Schaar, strode through a pack of reporters and photographers and told the lieutenant governor he needed to return to his post presiding over the chamber.Monday\u2019s spectacle beside the Houdon-designed George Washington statue in the Capitol was extraordinary: Mr. Fairfax, a 39-year-old African-American, rebutting claims of sexual misconduct and suggesting the accusations were part of an effort by allies of Mr. Northam\u2019s to salvage a governorship that is listing due to the racism that still scars Virginia.The fast-moving events began at 2:55 a.m. Monday, when aides to Mr. Fairfax \u2014 a Democrat widely seen as a rising star in the party \u2014 put out a statement saying the allegation was \u201cfalse\u201d and that Mr. Fairfax had \u201cnever assaulted anyone \u2014 ever \u2014 in any way, shape or form.\u201d The aides said that Mr. Fairfax was considering \u201cappropriate legal action against those attempting to spread this defamatory and false allegation.\u201dThe Post story Monday said the woman contacted the newspaper after Mr. Fairfax won election in November 2017 and alleged that he had sexually assaulted her in 2004.The Post was unable to corroborate her allegations, which Mr. Fairfax had denied, according to Monday\u2019s story. The Post, however, disputed the Fairfax statement\u2019s assertion that the newspaper had found inconsistencies and red flags in the woman\u2019s allegation.Fairfax aides issued a second statement on Monday afternoon, this time accusing The Post of having \u201csmeared\u201d Mr. Fairfax by publishing its Monday story detailing the allegations without corroboration. The Post\u2019s executive editor, Martin Baron, replied that Mr. Fairfax had gone first in \u201cissuing a statement regarding allegations against him, making specific representations about Post reporting,\u201d and that the paper had an obligation to clarify the nature of allegations and its reporting.As Mr. Northam held meetings Monday, first with his cabinet and then with his staff in the state Capitol complex, stunned legislators arrived to word of the middle-of-the-night statement by the Fairfax aides after the publication of the story by a site calledBig League Politics.After Mr. Fairfax, the second in line to become governor is the state attorney general, Mark Herring, a Democrat who had already indicated plans to run for governor in 2021."}, {"title": "Tech Is Splitting the U.S. Work Force in Two", "category": "Business", "id": "4253c67a-6d8f-4b67-858e-3a0ec47b9712", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/business/economy/productivity-inequality-wages.html", "publishdate": 20190204, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/business/05productivity-print/merlin_149958825_f18fdb3c-1504-4807-8a9e-f68a56e74763-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "PHOENIX \u2014 It\u2019s hard to miss the dogged technological ambition pervading this sprawling desert metropolis.There\u2019s Intel\u2019s $7 billion, seven-nanometer chip plant going up in Chandler. In Scottsdale, Axon, the maker of the Taser, is hungrily snatching talent from Silicon Valley as it embraces automation to keep up with growing demand. Start-ups in fields as varied as autonomous drones and blockchain are flocking to the area, drawn in large part by light regulation and tax incentives. Arizona State University is furiously churning out engineers. And yet for all its success in drawing and nurturing firms on the technological frontier, Phoenix cannot escape the uncomfortable pattern taking shape across the American economy: Despite all its shiny new high-tech businesses, the vast majority of new jobs are in workaday service industries, like health care, hospitality, retail and building services, where pay is mediocre.The forecast of an America where robots do all the work while humans live off some yet-to-be-invented welfare program may be a Silicon Valley pipe dream. But automation is changing the nature of work, flushing workers without a college degree out of productive industries, like manufacturing and high-tech services, and into tasks with meager wages and no prospect for advancement.Automation is splitting the American labor force into two worlds. There is a small island of highly educated professionals making good wages at corporations like Intel or Boeing, which reap hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit per employee. That island sits in the middle of a sea of less educated workers who are stuck at businesses like hotels, restaurants and nursing homes that generate much smaller profits per employee and stay viable primarily by keeping wages low.ImageA machine assembling a piece for a Taser. Axon hopes to reduce labor costs and improve productivity by increasing its use of machines to replace easy and monotonous actions.CreditDominic Valente for The New York TimesEven economists are reassessing their belief that technological progress lifts all boats, and are beginning to worry about the new configuration of work. Recent research has concluded that robots are reducing the demand for workers and weighing down wages, which have been rising more slowly than the productivity of workers. Some economists have concluded that the use of robots explains the decline in the share of national income going into workers\u2019 paychecks over the last three decades.Because it pushes workers to the less productive parts of the economy, automation also helps explain one of the economy\u2019s thorniest paradoxes: Despite the spread of information technology, robots and artificial intelligence breakthroughs, overall productivity growth remains sluggish.\u201cThe view that we should not worry about any of these things and follow technology to wherever it will go is insane,\u201d said Daron Acemoglu, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Semiconductor companies like Intel or NXP are among the most successful in the Phoenix area. From 2010 to 2017, the productivity of workers in such firms \u2014 a measure of the dollar value of their production \u2014 grew by about 2.1 percent per year, according to an analysis by Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton of the Brookings Institution. Pay is great: $2,790 a week, on average, according to government statistics.But the industry doesn\u2019t generate that many jobs. In 2017, the semiconductor and related devices industry employed 16,600 people in the Phoenix area, about 10,000 fewer than three decades ago. \u201cWe automate the pieces that can be automated,\u201d said Paul Hart, a senior vice president running the radio-frequency power business at NXP\u2019s plant in Chandler. \u201cThe work force grows but we need A.I. and automation to increase the throughput.\u201dAxon, which makes the Taser as well as body cameras used by police forces, is also automating whatever it can. Today, robots make four times as many Taser cartridges as 80 workers once did less than 10 years ago, said Bill Denzer, Axon\u2019s vice president for manufacturing. Workers\u2019 jobs were saved because the company brought other manufacturing work back from Mexico.The same is true across the high-tech landscape. Aircraft manufacturing employed 4,234 people in 2017, compared to 4,028 in 2010. Computer systems design services employed 11,000 people in 2017, up from 7,000 in 2010.The Fastest-Growing Jobs In PhoenixMost of the growth in the Phoenix-area job market since 1990 has come in low-productivity industries, like health care. Productivity is the dollar value of the output per worker in each industry. The job sectors in the charts below represent about two-thirds of all Phoenix-area jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t#g-02TK-biz-web-PRODUCTIVITY-box .g-artboard {\n\t\tmargin:0

productivity is low. Building services, like janitors and gardeners, employed nearly 35,000 people in the area in 2017, and health care and social services accounted for 254,000 workers. Restaurants and other eateries employed 136,000 workers, 24,000 more than at the trough of the recession in 2010. They made less than $450 a week.The biggest single employer in town is Banner Health, which has about 50,000 workers throughout a vast network that includes hospitals, outpatient clinics and home health aides. Though it employs high-paid doctors, it relies on an army of lower paid orderlies and technicians. A nursing assistant in Phoenix makes $31,000 a year, on average. A home health aide makes $24,000. While Banner invests heavily in technology, the machines do not generally reduce demand for workers. \u201cThere are not huge opportunities to increase productivity, but technology has a significant impact on quality,\u201d said Banner\u2019s chief operating officer, Becky Kuhn.The 58 most productive industries in Phoenix \u2014 where productivity ranges from $210,000 to $30 million per worker, according to Mr. Muro\u2019s and Mr. Whiton\u2019s analysis \u2014 employed only 162,000 people in 2017, 14,000 more than in 2010. Employment in the 58 industries with the lowest productivity, where it tops out at $65,000 per worker, grew 10 times as much over the period, to 673,000.The same is true across the national economy. Jobs grow in health care, social assistance, accommodation, food services, building administration and waste services. Not only are some of the tasks tough to automate, employers have little financial incentive to replace low-wage workers with machines.On the other end of the spectrum, the employment footprint of highly productive industries, like finance, manufacturing, information services and wholesale trade, has shrunk over the last 30 years.Economists have a hard time getting their heads around this. Steeped in the belief that technology inevitably leads to better jobs and higher pay, they long resisted the notion that the Luddites of the 19th century, who famously thrashed the weaving machines that were taking their jobs, might have had a point. \u201cIn the standard economic canon, the proposition that you can increase productivity and harm labor is bunkum,\u201d Mr. Acemoglu said.ImageLourdes Sorreles, a registered nurse, with Pablo Lopaz Romero in the progressive care unit of the Banner University Medical Center Phoenix. While many jobs are being automated, there are still holdouts in the economy, especially in the health fields.CreditDominic Valente for The New York TimesBy reducing prices and improving quality, technology was expected to raise demand, which would require more jobs. What\u2019s more, economists thought, more productive workers would have higher incomes. This would create demand for new, unheard-of things that somebody would have to make.To prove their case, economists pointed confidently to one of the greatest technological leaps of the last few hundred years, when the rural economy gave way to the industrial era.In 1900, agriculture employed 12 million Americans. By 2014, tractors, combines and other equipment had flushed 10 million people out of the sector. But as farm labor declined, the industrial economy added jobs even faster. What happened? As the new farm machines boosted food production and made produce cheaper, demand for agricultural products grew. And farmers used their higher incomes to purchase newfangled industrial goods.The new industries were highly productive and also subject to furious technological advancement. Weavers lost their jobs to automated looms; secretaries lost their jobs to Microsoft Windows. But each new spin of the technological wheel, from plastic toys to televisions to computers, yielded higher incomes for workers and more sophisticated products and services for them to buy.Something different is going on in our current technological revolution. In a new study, David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Anna Salomons of Utrecht University found that over the last 40 years, jobs have fallen in every single industry that introduced technologies to enhance productivity. The only reason employment didn\u2019t fall across the entire economy is that other industries, with less productivity growth, picked up the slack. \u201cThe challenge is not the quantity of jobs,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe challenge is the quality of jobs available to low- and medium-skill workers.\u201dRead more about automation and productivityThe Hidden Automation Agenda of the Davos EliteJan. 25, 2019\u2018The Beginning of a Wave\u2019: A.I. Tiptoes Into the WorkplaceAug. 5, 2018Robots or Job Training: Manufacturers Grapple With How to Improve Their Economic FortunesJune 25, 2018Lessons From Rust-Belt Cities That Kept Their SheenMay 1, 2018Adair Turner, a senior fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking in London, argues that the economy today resembles what would have happened if farmers had spent their extra income from the use of tractors and combines on domestic servants. Productivity in domestic work doesn\u2019t grow quickly. As more and more workers were bumped out of agriculture into servitude, productivity growth across the economy would have stagnated.\u201cUntil a few years ago, I didn\u2019t think this was a very complicated subject; The Luddites were wrong and the believers in technology and technological progress were right,\u201d Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary and presidential economic adviser, said in a lecture at the National Bureau of Economic Research five years ago. \u201cI\u2019m not so completely certain now.\u201dThe growing awareness of robots\u2019 impact on the working class raises anew a very old question: Could automation go too far? Mr. Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University argue that businesses are not even reaping large rewards for the money they are spending to replace their workers with machines.But the cost of automation to workers and society could be substantial. \u201cIt may well be that,\u201d Mr. Summers said, \u201csome categories of labor will not be able to earn a subsistence income.\u201d And this could exacerbate social ills, from workers dropping out of jobs and getting hooked on painkillers, to mass incarceration and families falling apart.Silicon Valley\u2019s dream of an economy without workers may be implausible. But an economy where most people toil exclusively in the lowliest of jobs might be little better."}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: Tech No Longer Carries the Stock Market", "category": "Business", "id": "5b04edf2-e1d0-4e1c-9491-35f29189819d", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/business/dealbook/tech-chips-slowdown.html", "publishdate": 20190204, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/business/05db-newsletter-apple/merlin_149904843_8120614f-b88f-4737-a14b-b871fc03b3f7-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Monday morning.

What\u2019s happening?Big tech companies are reporting lackluster results. Weak Chinese consumer demand blew a $9 billion hole in Apple\u2019s latest quarterly sales. Nvidia warned last month that its revenue would come in 20 percent below expectations. Intel\u2019s January financials didn\u2019t meet forecasts. And Samsung\u2019s sales plunged 10 percent in the fourth quarter.Behind the trend: semiconductors. \u201cChina, smartphones, Bitcoin and cloud computing have been among the major drivers of the long tech boom, which in turn has powered the global economy for the last decade. The ingredient common to all of these sectors is computer chips, which form the brains of devices and whose ubiquity means they provide early signals about changes in supply and demand,\u201d write David Streitfeld and Don Clark of the NYT. With chip manufacturers predicting slumping sales for 2019, tech more generally could be in line for a slowdown.Sound familiar? \u201cThe notion that a chip dip could lead to a general downturn evokes memories of 2000, when one day tech had an unlimited future and the next it was crashing in what became known as the dot-com bust,\u201d write Mr. Streitfeld and Mr. Clark.And the industry no longer carries the stock market. For years, stock market performance have been tied to the fortunes of the largest tech companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix. As the S&P 500 pushed to a record high last summer, rises in those six companies\u2019 share prices accounted for half of its gain. But when the index rallied nearly 8 percent in January, Stephen Grocer writes, their stocks accounted for just 17 percent of the rise.Lloyd Blankfein may pay for Goldman\u2019s links to 1MDBThe former Goldman Sachs C.E.O. \u2014 as well as his successor, David Solomon, and other top executives \u2014 may have to give back some compensation from 2018, depending on the findings of an investigation into the firm\u2019s work with the scandal-ridden Malaysian investment fund 1MDB.The announcement, made in a regulatory filing on Friday, shows how seriously Goldman is treating any role it may have had in fraud committed at 1MDB. Prosecutors in the U.S. and Malaysia are leading criminal investigations into 1MDB, and a former top deal maker at the firm has pleaded guilty to bribery, conspiracy and money laundering charges. Goldman says it\u2019s cooperating with authorities.The WSJ calculates that Mr. Blankfein, who stepped down as chief executive of Goldman last year, might lose millions. And though Mr. Solomon wasn\u2019t a top-ranking Goldman executive at the time, he could see some of his $23 million pay for last year clawed back as well. (Gary Cohn, who was Goldman\u2019s No. 2 during the 1MDB work and received a lump payout when he left the firm in 2017, wouldn\u2019t be affected.)In lighter Goldman news: Mr. Solomon, whose side hustle is DJing as DJ D-Sol, has released his second single, \u201cFeel Alive.\u201dDeutsche Bank refused Trump a loan in 2016For two decades, Deutsche Bank was the only major lender to give Donald Trump money, helping him finance his real estate operations. But when he sought a loan in early 2016 to help pay for a Scottish golf course \u2014 all while running for president \u2014 the German lender said no.More from David Enrich, Jesse Drucker and Ben Protess of the NYT:Senior officials at the bank, including its future chief executive, believed that Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive candidacy made such a loan too risky, the people said. Among their concerns was that if Mr. Trump won the election and then defaulted, Deutsche Bank would have to choose between not collecting on the debt or seizing the assets of the president of the United States.What\u2019s next: Expect House Democrats to include this in their investigation of Mr. Trump\u2019s finances.More Deutsche Bank news: The lender reportedly scrambled to rid itself of a $600 million loan made to VTB, a Russian state-owned bank, in late 2016 as the German bank sought to reduce its exposure to Russian entities.How an S.U.V. became a Brexit warning signThe automaker Nissan confirmed yesterday that it had abandoned plans to build its new X-Trail sport utility vehicle in Britain and said that the car would be produced solely in Japan. It\u2019s a blow for the British economy, and a clear signal that uncertainty over Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. is weighing on corporate minds.A clear culprit. \u201cThe continued uncertainty around the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the E.U. is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future,\u201d Nissan\u2019s Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said in a statement. Greg Clark, Britain\u2019s business secretary, told the FT that it was \u201ca warning sign\u201d about how much damage could be caused by a no-deal Brexit.Nissan is not alone. British C.F.O.s say that Brexit is currently the largest threat to their businesses. Some 78 percent of those surveyed said that the business environment in the nation would deteriorate if Britain left the E.U.What now? Prime Minister Theresa May is set to return to Brussels in the coming days in an attempt to redraft her Brexit deal. In the meantime, Bloomberg reports that she \u201cwill launch a new government working group intended to unite the feuding pro- and anti-Brexit factions\u201d in her party.ImageA Shell processing plant near Wink, Tex.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesThe oil field that made American oil greatThe U.S. is now the top oil producer in the world, able to sway petroleum prices and breezily sanction Iran and Venezuela. The reason, as Cliff Krauss of the NYT notes: the Permian Basin, the heart of America\u2019s shale industry.How big is it? It covers the same area as South Dakota, and produces four million barrels of oil a day \u2014 making it a bigger generator of oil than any member of OPEC other than Iraq and Saudi Arabia.What makes it special? It\u2019s huge and rich in oil rather than in less-valuable natural gas. And it\u2019s close to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico.What could go wrong? Oil companies there might pump too much, drawing ire from OPEC. As Scott Sheffield, the chairman of Pioneer Natural Resources, told the NYT: \u201cYou could have another price war.\u201d And U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan crude could hurt American refineries, which can\u2019t rely solely on the Permian.Hungry for \u2018executive time\u2019 in your calendar? Study Trump\u2019s schedule and weepAxios has published almost three months of President Trump\u2019s schedules after they were leaked, reportedly by somebody in the White House. Some highlights:\u2022 \u201cTrump has spent around 60 percent of his scheduled time over the past three months in unstructured \u2018Executive Time.\u2019 \u201d\u2022 \u201cHe spends his mornings in the residence, watching TV, reading the papers, and responding to what he sees and reads by phoning aides, members of Congress, friends, administration officials and informal advisers,\u201d six people with direct knowledge of his schedule told Axios.\u2022 \u201cTrump\u2019s first meeting of the day \u2014 usually around 11 or 11:30 a.m. \u2014 is often an intelligence briefing or a 30-minute meeting with the chief of staff.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe president sometimes has meetings during Executive Time that he doesn\u2019t want most West Wing staff to know about for fear of leaks.

It concluded that the \u201cproposal undervalues Gannett and is not in the best interests of Gannett and its shareholders\u201d and called it not \u201ccredible.\u201dThe bid was made last month, amid a hollowing out of local newspapers across the country. Broader shifts in the media industry have devastated smaller publications over the past decade, with many closing and others reducing newsroom staffs and the number of times a week they are printed. Gannett recently laid off workers and has been steadily reducing its work force since 2015, when its television stations were cleaved into a separate company.If MNG purchased Gannett, it would create the largest newspaper publisher in the nation, adding Gannett\u2019s lineup to a stable of 200 papers that include The Denver Post and The San Jose Mercury News. But media watchers have worried how such a merger could affect the already weakened local media landscape. Critics have derided Alden as a \u201cdestroyer of newspapers,\u201d prone to \u201csavage\u201d layoffs and \u201cone of the most ruthless of the corporate strip miners seemingly intent on destroying local journalism.\u201dMNG, which owns approximately 7 percent of Gannett\u2019s stock, said the publisher\u2019s rejection showed a disregard for its shareholders. \u201cThe sad reality for Gannett shareholders is the company has no credible plan to attain a $12-per-share valuation on its own,\u201d MNG said in a statement.That kind of tit-for-tat sniping isn\u2019t unusual in shareholder battles, and the fight for the future of Gannett could lead to a standoff over board nominees. MNG said it would now consider putting forth its own directors, who would vote for the offer if elected. Gannett typically holds elections in the spring.Gannett, which also owns newspapers like The Detroit Free Press and The Tennessean in Nashville, has pushed a plan to transform its papers into digital outlets. It has spent over $300 million acquiring online advertising technologies and services, including ReachLocal and WordStream. MNG has been critical of that strategy and has asked Gannett to immediately review alternatives and to commit to a freeze on additional acquisitions of digital businesses.The Alden-controlled publisher called Gannett\u2019s digital strategy \u201cpie in the sky,\u201d adding that its \u201cproblems are better fixed by experienced operators such as MNG, away from pressures of the public markets.\u201dIn a letter dated Jan. 16, the chairman of Gannett\u2019s board, J. Jeffry Louis, asked MNG a series of questions, such as how it planned to finance its bid and how it planned to deal with potential antitrust scrutiny. Mr. Louis invited MNG\u2019s leaders to discuss the issues, but then questioned the company\u2019s motives when MNG required all parties to sign a nondisclosure agreement before any meeting.The Alden-controlled company disputed that characterization and said, \u201cThere are no impediments \u2014 aside from the Gannett board \u2014 to MNG completing the proposed transaction and for Gannett shareholders to achieve real value.\u201dMNG\u2019s bid of $12 a share is a 23 percent premium to where Gannett had been trading before the offer. After Gannett\u2019s rejection Monday, shares in the company ended the day down 2.2 percent at $10.97, after closing at $11.22 on Friday."}, {"title": "Northam Scandal Opens Rift Between Top Democrats in Virginia", "category": "Politics", "id": "8a25acdd-7bc4-4b68-b9c6-8ac450612682", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/us/politics/northam-photo.html", "publishdate": 20190204, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/us/politics/05virginia/05virginia-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Virginia plunged deeper into political turmoil Monday as Gov. Ralph Northam told aides he was not planning to step down, and his own lieutenant governor suggested Mr. Northam\u2019s supporters were behind an effort to smear him with claims of sexual assault to block his ascent if the governor resigned.Dazed lawmakers arriving here for their legislative session said they did not know how much longer Mr. Northam would be governor or whether Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax would replace him amid the growing tensions between the state\u2019s two top leaders, both Democrats.\u201cEverybody is shaking their heads, nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said State Senator Creigh Deeds, a Democrat who ran for governor a decade ago. \u201cIt might change in 15 minutes.\u201dThe cascade of events began Monday morning when Mr. Northam met first with his cabinet and then with his staff, some of whom have urged him to quit over questions about a racist photograph that appeared on his medical school yearbook page.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Mr. Northam told his cabinet members that he wanted time to clear his name and would remain in office for now, according to a Democrat familiar with the meeting. And the governor\u2019s chief of staff told other aides that they owed it to Mr. Northam to remain with him, at least for the moment, according to a second Democrat briefed on the conversation. Still, Mr. Northam was bracing for resignations from his cabinet, which his advisers expected to come before the end of the week.But a state that prides itself on its decorum was thrown into further chaos when Mr. Fairfax emphatically denied a woman\u2019s claim that he had sexually assaulted her in 2004, and indicated that Mr. Northam\u2019s allies were plotting against him to keep him from assuming the governor\u2019s post if Mr. Northam resigned.\u201cDoes anybody think it\u2019s any coincidence that on the eve of potentially my being elevated that that\u2019s when this uncorroborated smear comes out?\u201d Mr. Fairfax told a group of reporters surrounding him in the rotunda of the State Capitol Monday afternoon, when asked whether Mr. Northam was responsible for the accusations becoming public.Speaking to reporters outside the Capitol on Monday evening, Mr. Fairfax adjusted his stance slightly, saying he had \u201cno indication\u201d that Mr. Northam himself was behind the publication of the sexual assault allegations but still decrying the \u201csneaky\u201d tactics that he said were being employed against him. Then Mr. Fairfax shifted targets and hinted that Mayor Levar Stoney of Richmond, a would-be rival to the lieutenant governor for the 2021 Democratic nomination for governor, may have played a role \u2014 praising the acumen of a reporter who inquired whether Mr. Stoney might have been responsible.Asked if he had any involvement in leaking the claims of assault, which first surfaced Sunday night on a right-wing website, Mr. Stoney said, \u201cThe insinuation is 100 percent not true, and frankly it\u2019s offensive.\u201dAddressing the allegations, which The Washington Post also published Monday morning, Mr. Fairfax said that he only had what he called \u201ca 100 percent consensual\u201d sexual encounter with the woman at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. In a private meeting with Senate Democrats Monday morning, Mr. Fairfax voiced the same categorical denials about the assault claims, according to a lawmaker present for the gathering.[Read here about the allegations against Mr. Fairfax and his denial]Neither Mr. Fairfax nor the Post named the woman. The Post said it was unable to corroborate the woman\u2019s allegations when she presented them, and did not run a story. The Post, however, disputed a statement by Mr. Fairfax saying that the newspaper had found inconsistencies and red flags in the woman\u2019s allegation; the newspaper labeled those assertions as incorrect.VideoThe governor and attorney general acknowledged wearing blackface in the past, and the lieutenant governor faced an allegation of sexual assault.CreditCreditParker Michels-Boyce for The New York TimesThe New York Times has reached out to intermediaries for the woman, but they did not immediately comment on Monday.Asked if Mr. Northam was behind the story, an adviser to the embattled governor denied any responsibility, saying they did not have the capacity to hatch such scheme when they are barely clinging to power.On the question of whether he believes the governor should resign, Mr. Fairfax noted that he is in \u201ca unique position\u201d and wanted to remain \u201ccircumspect\u201d about the matter.The day\u2019s swirling events left both politicians bruised at a time when Democrats in Virginia were trying to end the crisis and restore calm to their ranks.Even as Mr. Northam dug in, his onetime allies in the state and national Democratic Party intensified their pleas that he quit, angry and embarrassed at the prospect of being saddled with a governor suddenly compromised by his past. Senator Elizabeth Warren on Monday renewed her call for him to step down, stating that Mr. Northam had \u201cadmitted to enough involvement with racial stereotypes that he\u2019s disqualified himself as governor.\u2019\u2019Mr. Northam first came under fire last Friday when a photograph was published online showing people dressed in blackface and Ku Klux Klan robes on his 1984 yearbook page from Eastern Virginia Medical School. After initially acknowledging that it was him in the photograph and apologizing, the governor reversed course on Saturday and said he was sure it was not him.But he undermined his chances for survival by also acknowledging that in the same year he had used shoe polish to darken his face for a Michael Jackson costume at a dance party.The disclosure of the yearbook photo has also shaken Mr. Northam\u2019s alma mater. The college\u2019s provost, Richard V. Homan, has hired a law firm to investigate how it was that offensive pictures came to be published in past yearbooks, and has formed community advisory group to examine the campus\u2019s culture.\u201cWe need to get the best information we can as to what happened, how it was able to happen, so we can make sure we don\u2019t allow those circumstances to exist in the future,\u201d said Vincent Rhodes, the school\u2019s chief communications officer.While Mr. Northam told his aides that he wanted to act deliberately at an unprecedented moment in the state\u2019s history, his dwindling circle of advisers scrambled to locate the governor\u2019s classmates in an effort to prove he was not one of the men in the now-notorious image.Mr. Northam was surrounded by his longtime chief of staff, Clark Mercer, and spokeswoman, Ofirah Yheskel. He also summoned aides from his 2017 campaign, an election that marked the Democrats\u2019 first major victory in the Trump era.Across Capitol Square on an unusually warm winter day, shellshocked state legislators did not quite know what to say as they navigated around a phalanx of national television crews.Kirk Cox, the Republican speaker of the House of Delegates who has called on the governor to quit, said that he did not want to pursue impeachment against Mr. Northam and that it was uncertain if the crisis met the threshold for removing him from office.But the governor, already cast out by Virginia\u2019s political leaders, was fast becoming a pariah outside Richmond, too.And the fallout began to spread beyond the political realm, as the governor and the College of William and Mary agreed that he would not attend the formal inauguration of its president on Friday. \u201cThat behavior has no place in civil society \u2014 not 35 years ago, not today,\u201d said Katherine Rowe, the president of the university, Virginia\u2019s oldest institution of higher learning.The day\u2019s chaotic tone was set at 2:55 a.m. Monday, when aides to Mr. Fairfax \u2014 a Democrat widely seen as a rising star in the party \u2014 put out a statement saying the allegation was \u201cfalse\u201d and that Mr. Fairfax had \u201cnever assaulted anyone \u2014 ever \u2014 in any way, shape or form.\u201d The aides said that Mr. Fairfax is considering \u201cappropriate legal action against those attempting to spread this defamatory and false allegation.\u201dMr. Fairfax\u2019s aides said The Washington Post had investigated the claims around the time of the lieutenant governor\u2019s inauguration last year but did not publish an article.According to a Post story Monday, the woman contacted the newspaper after Mr. Fairfax won election in November 2017 and alleged that he had sexually assaulted her in 2004.The Post had been unable to corroborate her allegations, which Mr. Fairfax had denied at the time, according to the story.Lawmakers in Richmond insisted that, despite the tumult, they were trying to work as normal. This week is among the most crucial for the General Assembly, because Tuesday is \u201ccrossover day,\u201d the moment on the legislative calendar when the two chambers swap their passed bills.And as sunset neared on the Jefferson-designed Capitol, the House of Delegates was in session, considering a bill about embryos and assisted conception as its members sat quietly in their seats. One was wrapped in a blanket.\u201cI\u2019m just sort of focusing what we\u2019re working on,\u201d said Alfonso H. Lopez, a Northern Virginia legislator who is the House\u2019s Democratic whip.But when they stepped away from their desks, the lawmakers could not help but express their fears about the implications of Mr. Northam remaining in office.By Monday evening the governor had spent more than three long nights in deepening political isolation, abandoned by Democrats who quickly came to see his diminished standing as a burden on two fronts: their policy agenda, including matters like teacher pay and tax policy, and their efforts to capture control of the House of Delegates and the Senate this year.Both chambers are within reach for the party, which has made gains throughout the state in recent years.\u201cIt would be very burdensome for us in this election year to have a governor who\u2019s being protested at every stop,\u201d said Mark Sickles, a Democratic legislator from Northern Virginia."}, {"title": "Stacey Abrams, Preparing Her State of the Union Response, Weighs Senate Run", "category": "Politics", "id": "f5626f7a-12fc-48f2-9b66-cb5ca0b85e2b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/us/politics/state-of-the-union-stacey-abrams.html", "publishdate": 20190204, "imageurl": "", "content": "Stacey Abrams\u2019s defeat in the Georgia governor\u2019s race was only a few weeks old when she arrived in New York in December to meet with campaign donors and political allies. At a reception in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood, a supporter asked her what she would do next.Ms. Abrams, attendees recalled, said she was undecided, except on one point: She was determined to seek high office again.Since that meeting, Ms. Abrams\u2019s next political moment has arrived with startling speed. She is set to give the Democratic response to President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address on Tuesday night, a task of extraordinary prominence and an unheard-of distinction for a candidate who fell short of victory in the midterms.But Ms. Abrams\u2019s planned rebuttal to Mr. Trump is only one element of the role she is positioned to play in national politics: Democratic Party leaders are already imploring her to put her name back on the ballot, this time as a challenger to Senator David Perdue, a Georgia Republican who is loyally aligned with Mr. Trump. Democrats believe that by challenging Mr. Perdue in 2020, Ms. Abrams could help break the Republican Party\u2019s near-monopoly on Southern power in the Senate, and perhaps help make Georgia competitive in the presidential race.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Ms. Abrams remains undecided about running for the Senate, according to multiple people who have spoken with her directly. Her longstanding aspiration has been to serve as Georgia\u2019s governor, and she still believes that is the most consequential job she could seek. But her allies acknowledge that Ms. Abrams is listening to her party\u2019s entreaties, and that she has grown more open to the idea of opposing Mr. Perdue.The party\u2019s establishment has lined up strongly behind the idea, with Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, and multiple Democratic presidential candidates lobbying her to enter the race. Charles Myers, an investor and Democratic political donor who raised money for Ms. Abrams in 2018, said he and other contributors were eager to back her in a new campaign.\u201cI hope she runs,\u201d Mr. Myers said, adding of the governor\u2019s race: \u201cThat election was stolen from her.\u201dMore than any other candidate of 2018, Ms. Abrams has come to sit at a nexus of important forces in Democratic politics: Her candidacy became a symbol to national Democrats, first of the power that women and African-Americans exercised in the midterms, and then of an electoral system the party views as badly broken. She became something of a political martyr with her narrow loss to Brian Kemp, a Republican who supervised the election as Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, and whom Ms. Abrams and civil rights groups accused of seeking to suppress minority votes.In her campaign, Ms. Abrams, 45, seemed at times to preview the balancing act Democrats may seek to execute in the presidential race, mixing a progressive message on issues like health care with a vision of bipartisan government and economic growth that attracted moderate suburban whites.Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to former President Barack Obama who is close with Ms. Abrams, called the loss a painful but not crippling one. \u201cYou can be hurt by the outcome of an election, but not defeated,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. \u201cAnd she is far from defeated.\u201dDuBose Porter, a former Georgia Democratic Party chairman, said he believed Ms. Abrams was increasingly receptive to the idea of running for Senate, rather than waiting for a rematch with Mr. Kemp in 2022.\u201cA month ago, I would have said this is not something that she would really be considering,\u201d Mr. Porter said. \u201cI would say it is probably a 50-50 call right now.\u201dIf Ms. Abrams appears to be a politician with singular appeal, capturing a Senate seat in Georgia would still be no small challenge. The state\u2019s demographics are changing, with the booming city and suburbs of Atlanta propelling Georgia toward majority-minority status within the next decade. But no Democrat has won a Senate race there since 2000, and the last to do so, Zell Miller, was a conservative-leaning former governor whose worldview and strategy came from a now-distant political generation.Mr. Perdue, a wealthy businessman from a politically prominent family, won his first term in 2014 by trouncing Michelle Nunn, a prized Democratic recruit, by nearly 8 percentage points.ImageSenator David Perdue talked to reporters on Capitol Hill last month.CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesFormer Representative Jack Kingston, a Republican who sought the Senate seat in 2014 but lost in the primary, said he saw Mr. Perdue as a strong bet for re-election. In a Senate race, Mr. Kingston said, Ms. Abrams would be up against the leftward tilt of her own party: He predicted Republicans would tie her to figures like Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, three of the liberal women of color who electrified Democrats in the midterms, and who positioned themselves well to Ms. Abrams\u2019s left.\u201cGeorgia is still a conservative, center-right state,\u201d Mr. Kingston said, adding of Ms. Abrams\u2019s last race: \u201cShe had a really, really strong anti-Trump wave and she had a good organization with lots of outside money. But that\u2019s not going to happen again.\u201dMs. Abrams declined to be interviewed before the State of the Union. She has been occupied in Georgia launching a new nonprofit group, Fair Fight Action, that is waging a legal fight against the election rules that Democrats believe cost Ms. Abrams the race. Staying in the public eye, Ms. Abrams has been organizing \u201cthank you\u201d events with supporters around the state, and her group aired an ad about voting rights during the Super Bowl.But the Senate race has been looming: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York called Ms. Abrams shortly after the November election and urged her to run for Senate, and Senator Kamala Harris of California encouraged Ms. Abrams over lunch last month to run for office again, people briefed on the conversations said. Ms. Abrams met in January with Mr. Schumer and Senator Catherine Cortez-Masto, who helms the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, to discuss the campaign.Though Democrats have long sought to regain their footing in the South \u2014 coveting Senate seats in places like Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee \u2014 the urgency of that challenge has grown after the 2018 elections, when Democrats lost three Senate races in the rural Midwest even as they gained 40 seats in the House.To break the Republicans\u2019 53-seat Senate majority, Democrats must gain three or four Republican-held seats in 2020, depending on whether they also control the vice presidency, which settles tied votes in the chamber. Mr. Perdue is one of three Southern incumbents who are likely to be seriously challenged, along with Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, and Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, currently the only Democratic senator in the Deep South.Quentin James, a Democratic strategist who heads the Collective PAC, a group that backs African-American candidates, said Democrats\u2019 best chance to take the Senate was by activating the increasingly diverse electorates in Republican-dominated Southern states.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to lose Blue Dog Democrats in Missouri and North Dakota,\u201d Mr. James said, referring to states where centrist Democrats were defeated in November, \u201cthen you need to pick up seats somewhere, and you need to do it in the South.\u201dMr. James expressed ambivalence about the all-out drive to recruit Ms. Abrams for the Senate race, calling her a superb contender but noting that the Democratic Party had not always been so receptive to candidates like her. In her campaign for governor, Ms. Abrams faced resistance from some prominent Democratic leaders, including former Gov. Roy Barnes and former Senator Max Cleland of Georgia, who backed a white state legislator, Stacey Evans, for the Democratic nomination.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people wanting Stacey Abrams to save the party by running for the Senate,\u201d Mr. James said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that.\u201dIf there was early hesitation about Ms. Abrams in the midterms, there is no trace of Democratic skepticism now.Nancy Koziol, a Democratic political donor who attended Ms. Abrams\u2019s December event in New York, said she hoped Ms. Abrams would challenge Mr. Perdue. And, channeling Ms. Abrams\u2019s stature in the Democratic imagination, Ms. Koziol envisioned a path leading beyond even the Senate.\u201cI would love to see her have a bigger stage,\u201d Ms. Koziol said. \u201cI would love to see her be president when my daughter can vote for her.\u201d"}, {"title": "Recent Commercial Real Estate Transactions", "category": "Business", "id": "b764fe0d-87a6-4ae6-84a7-9958f9ad4333", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/realestate/commercial/recent-commercial-real-estate-transactions.html", "publishdate": 20190205, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/06/realestate/commercial/06transFor-sale/06transFor-sale--articleLarge.jpg", "content": "FOR SALE$9 MILLION4202 Second Avenue (between 42nd and 43rd Streets)Sunset Park, BrooklynThis blocklong, 19,750-square-foot warehouse, in an opportunity zone offering a potential break on capital-gains taxes, features 20-foot ceilings, eight drive-in bays and about 1,000 square feet of office space on the mezzanine level.

Tackling a biological puzzle they call \u201cthe protein folding problem,\u201d they try to predict the three-dimensional shape of proteins in the human body. No one knows how to solve the problem. Even the winners only chip away at it. But a solution could streamline the way scientists create new medicines and fight disease.Mohammed AlQuraishi, a biologist who has dedicated his career to this kind of research, flew in early December to Cancun, Mexico, where academics were gathering to discuss the results of the latest contest. As he checked into his hotel, a five-star resort on the Caribbean, he was consumed by melancholy.The contest, the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction, was not won by academics. It was won by DeepMind, the artificial intelligence lab owned by Google\u2019s parent company.\u201cI was surprised and deflated,\u201d said Dr. AlQuraishi, a researcher at Harvard Medical School. \u201cThey were way out in front of everyone else.\u201dDeepMind specializes in \u201cdeep learning,\u201d a type of artificial intelligence that is rapidly changing drug discovery science. A growing number of companies are applying similar methods to other parts of the long, enormously complex process that produces new medicines. These A.I. techniques can speed up many aspects of drug discovery and, in some cases, perform tasks typically handled by scientists.\u201cIt is not that machines are going to replace chemists,\u201d said Derek Lowe, a longtime drug discovery researcher and the author of In the Pipeline, a widely read blog dedicated to drug discovery. \u201cIt\u2019s that the chemists who use machines will replace those that don\u2019t.\u201dAfter the conference in Cancun, Dr. AlQuraishi described his experience in a blog post. The melancholy he felt after losing to DeepMind gave way to what he called \u201ca more rational assessment of the value of scientific progress.\u201dBut he strongly criticized big pharmaceutical companies like Merck and Novartis, as well as his academic community, for not keeping pace.\u201cThe smartest and most ambitious researchers wanting to work on protein structure will look to DeepMind for opportunities instead of Merck or Novartis,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis fact should send chills down the spines of pharma executives, but it won\u2019t, because they\u2019re clueless, rudderless, and asleep at the helm.\u201dThe big pharma companies see the situation differently. Though Merck is not exploring protein folding because its researchers believe its potential impact would be years away, it is applying deep learning to other aspects of its drug discovery process.\u201cWe have to connect so many other dots,\u201d said Juan Alvarez, associate vice president of computational and structural chemistry at Merck.In the spring of 2016, after making headlines with A.I. systems that played complex games like the ancient board game Go, DeepMind researchers were looking for new challenges. So they held a \u201chackathon\u201d at company headquarters in London.Working with two other computer scientists, the DeepMind researcher Rich Evans homed in on protein folding. They found a game that simulated this scientific task. They built a system that learned to play the game on its own, and the results were promising enough for DeepMind to greenlight a full-time research project.The protein folding problem asks a straightforward question: Can you predict the physical structure of a protein \u2014 its shape in three dimensions?If scientists can predict a protein\u2019s shape, they can better determine how other molecules will \u201cbind\u201d to it \u2014 attach to it, physically \u2014 and that is one way drugs are developed. A drug binds to particular proteins in your body and changes their behavior.In the latest contest, DeepMind made these predictions using \u201cneural networks,\u201d complex mathematical systems that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing thousands of proteins, a neural network can learn to predict the shape of others.This is the same deep learning technology that recognizes faces in the photos you post to Facebook. Over the past decade, the technology has reinvented a wide range of internet services, consumer products, robotic devices and other areas of scientific research.Many of the academics who competed used methods that were similar to what DeepMind was doing. But DeepMind won the competition by a sizable margin \u2014 it improved the prediction accuracy nearly twice as much as experts expected from the contest winner.DeepMind\u2019s victory showed how the future of biochemical research will increasingly be driven by machines and the people who oversee those machines.This kind of A.I. research benefits from enormous amounts of computing power, and DeepMind can lean on the massive computer data centers that underpin Google. The lab also employs many of the world\u2019s top A.I. researchers, who know how to get the most out of this hardware.\u201cIt allows us to be much more creative, to try many more ideas, often in parallel,\u201d said Demis Hassabis, the chief executive and a co-founder of DeepMind, which Google acquired for a reported $650 million in 2014.Universities and big pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to match those resources. But thanks to cloud computing services offered by Google and other tech giants, the price of computing power continues to drop. Dr. AlQuraishi urged the life-sciences community to shift more attention toward the kind of A.I. work practiced by DeepMind.Some researchers are already moving in that direction. Many start-ups, like Atomwise in San Francisco and Recursion in Salt Lake City, are using the same artificial intelligence techniques to accelerate other aspects of drug discovery. Recursion, for instance, uses neural networks and other methods to analyze images of cells and learn how new drugs affect these cells.The big pharma companies are also beginning to explore these methods, sometimes in partnership with start-ups.\u201cEveryone is trending up in this area,\u201d said Jeremy Jenkins, the head of data science for chemical biology and therapeutics at Novartis. \u201cIt is like turning a big ship, and I think these methods will eventually scale to the size of our entire company.\u201dMr. Hassabis said DeepMind was committed to solving the protein folding problem. But many experts said that even if it was solved, more work was needed before doctors and patients benefited in any practical way.\u201cThis is a first step,\u201d said David Baker, the director of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington. \u201cThere are so many other steps still to go.\u201dAs they work to better understand the proteins in the body, for instance, scientists must also create new proteins that can serve as drug candidates. Dr. Baker now believes that creating proteins is more important to drug discovery than the \u201cfolding\u201d methods being explored, and this task, he said, is not as well suited to DeepMind-style A.I.DeepMind researchers focus on games and contests because they can show a clear improvement in artificial intelligence. But it is not clear how that approach translates to many tasks.\u201cBecause of the complexity of drug discovery, we need a wide variety of tools,\u201d Dr. Alvarez said. \u201cThere is no one-size-fits-all answer.\u201d"}, {"title": "A School Board Says No to Big Oil, and Alarms Sound in Business-Friendly Louisiana", "category": "Business", "id": "aa9455f3-f23c-4c3b-86c2-c6d457f67c1e", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/us/louisiana-itep-exxon-mobil.html", "publishdate": 20190205, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/us/05louisiana-01/merlin_149139153_8d3e887b-508e-4f00-9c20-e48584c19d5d-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 It was a squabble over $2.9 million in property-tax breaks \u2014 small change for Exxon Mobil, a company that measures its earnings by the billions.But when the East Baton Rouge Parish school board rejected the energy giant\u2019s rather routine request last month, the \u201cno\u201d vote went off like a bomb in a state where obeisance to the oil, gas and chemical industries is the norm.The local chamber of commerce took out a full-page newspaper ad, warning of a rise of \u201cradicalism.\u201d The head of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry wrote that \u201cthe anti-business crowd has had their fun,\u201d but needed to \u201ccool their jets.\u201dAnd now, somewhat surprisingly, business-friendly Louisiana finds that it is the latest flash point in a roiling, community-by-community debate that pits liberals and local activists against defenders of the lavish tax incentives offered to woo big business.It has been a David vs. Goliath story in the Louisiana capital, where a grass-roots coalition of black and white churches, activists and ordinary citizens have successfully clamored to democratize a system that used to dole out billions in property-tax breaks without giving the local school boards, city councils and other government entities that depend on those taxes any say in the matter.The vote has also revived a vexing, and defining, Louisiana question about the deference a perennially impoverished state must show to big business.\u201cWe\u2019ve allowed the oil and gas industry to hijack our democracy,\u201d said Russel L. Honor\u00e9, a retired Army lieutenant general who earned acclaim for leading the military response to Hurricane Katrina, and who had urged the East Baton Rouge Parish school board to reject the exemptions. \u201cThe industry will brag about it all the time, how well we\u2019re doing in terms of business development. Well, if we\u2019re doing so well, why are we the second-poorest state?\u201dComplaints that state and local governments have given away the farm to big business have flared recently in other states as well, most sharply in New York City, where liberal politicians and union supporters have blasted the incentives of up to $3 billion that helped woo Amazon\u2019s new corporate offices in Queens. In Virginia, a socialist state House member, Lee Carter, has called a $70 million grant package for the chip maker Micron \u201ccorrupt.\u201dBut the tone is markedly different in Baton Rouge. Though the city is home to the state\u2019s flagship university, it is more Bakersfield than Berkeley, defined strongly by the business and culture of the oil patch. Exxon Mobil\u2019s vast old refinery on the North Side has employed generations of local workers. It is the area\u2019s largest manufacturer and largest taxpayer.Dawn Chanet Collins was among the school board members who voted against the tax break in a 5-4 vote in mid-January. Though she praised the oil giant for the donations and volunteer hours it showers on local schools, she said that giving the company exemptions for the already completed expansions of the refinery and a polymer plant simply did not make sense.The school district is in a budget crisis, and it is looking for ways to cut roughly $30 million in future spending. Layoffs may be on the table. Teachers say that administrators have even been rationing paper.\u201cIt would have been completely irresponsible for the board to say, \u2018Go ahead, keep your money,\u2019 when we have to fill a $30 million gap on our end,\u201d Ms. Collins said.For decades, industrial property-tax breaks in Louisiana were in the sole control of a little-noticed state board that approved them with no local input \u2014 a system unique in the nation, according to Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit group that tracks such incentives.Gov. John Bel Edwards, a moderate Democrat, overhauled the process in 2016 with an executive order that for the first time in 80 years gave local governments the right to decide whether their revenue would be sacrificed to aid industry.ImageBroderick Bagert, left, and Edgar Cage are organizers with Together Baton Rouge, a coalition that has become a powerful force opposing the lavish property-tax breaks Louisiana has traditionally granted to industry.CreditEmily Kask for The New York TimesIn the months before Mr. Edwards\u2019s order, the state\u2019s Industrial Tax Exemption Program, or ITEP, had been thrust into the public debate by the efforts of the grass-roots coalition, known as Together Baton Rouge. Before then, it had gone largely unnoticed by everyone except those who benefited from it.The appointed panel that ran the program, the Board of Commerce and Industry, handed out nearly $10 billion in local tax exemptions between 2008 and 2016, but its actions were rarely covered in the press. Many Louisianans had no idea what the board did.\u201cNobody knew about it,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cIt had gone on for so long that people had forgotten.\u201dTogether Baton Rouge and its sister organization, Together Louisiana, argue that the industrial tax breaks starve local schools and governments of badly needed funds and leave them unable to lift a state mired toward the bottom of national rankings on education, crime and infrastructure. In Baton Rouge, one in four residents lives in poverty.Their message has found an audience: Together Louisiana\u2019s YouTube video about the exemptions, posted in November and titled \u201cWhy Louisiana Stays Poor,\u201d has been viewed more than 600,000 times.A few days before the Baton Rouge school board vote, the groups held a meeting at St. Mary Baptist Church to organize opposition to the Exxon Mobil application. Scores of people crammed into a Bible study classroom decorated with maps and photos of the Holy Land.Edgar Cage, who organized the meeting, was careful to say that no one was accusing Exxon Mobil of any wrongdoing. \u201cAll we\u2019re saying is, we want a change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want a balance.\u201dBusiness leaders reacted strongly to the Baton Rouge vote because they are worried about much more than just how a few capital improvements are taxed. As much as $90 billion in oil and gas industry investments could come the state\u2019s way in the next decade, driven in large part by the boom in domestic shale gas drilling, according to David Dismukes, executive director of the Center for Energy Studies at Louisiana State University.By itself, Dr. Dismukes said, the school board\u2019s vote \u201cwas not a big deal \u2014 but the precedent it sets is going to be really big for these projects on the drawing board that are $100 million or $200 million.\u201dCritics of the 2016 overhaul that gave local officials a say over tax breaks argue that it deprives the state of a big competitive edge it used to enjoy: one-stop shopping. Instead of dealing only with a central state board, businesses must now make their case for tax breaks to a host of parish councils and school boards and sheriffs, and win them over individually.Last week, State Senator Mack A. White Jr., a Republican from the Baton Rouge area who used to work for Exxon Mobil, said he planned introduce a bill to reverse the overhaul and take approval power away from local officials again.There have also been stabs at damage control and soul-searching. Mayor Sharon Weston Broome of Baton Rouge spoke on Jan. 28 at what the local newspaper described as a \u201cpep rally\u201d for Exxon Mobil.On Sunday, Tim Morris, a columnist for The Times-Picayune in New Orleans, compared the state\u2019s tax-break system to the $241 million contract extension the New Orleans Pelicans of the N.B.A. offered to their star player Anthony Davis \u2014 an offer he turned down, asking to be traded instead.\u201cWhy do we have to offer exorbitant bribes to get people (and businesses) to stay here?\u201d Mr. Morris wrote.But for others \u2014 including some local government officials freshly armed with the new veto power \u2014 the tax breaks are a pragmatic choice in an increasingly competitive world.In November, local authorities in Calcasieu Parish unanimously approved a tax break worth $2 billion over 10 years for a $15 billion liquefied natural gas facility. Eric Tarver, a car dealer who sits on the parish school board, said he feared \u201cplaying chicken\u201d with a big company that was promising to create hundreds of jobs.\u201cShould we have negotiated with them? Maybe,\u201d Mr. Tarver said. \u201cBut the benefits of them coming far outweigh the risk of haggling with them and having them go to Corpus Christi or Houston, or even Lafayette.\u201d"}, {"title": "With Northam Picture, Obscure Publication Plays Big Role in Virginia Politics", "category": "Politics", "id": "724caf08-8610-4503-b7d0-a56a74ecbfbf", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/us/politics/northam-fairfax-big-league-politics.html", "publishdate": 20190205, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/us/politics/05bigleaguepolitics1/merlin_150191466_35164fc4-1a75-4830-9e45-ecf8f6bca510-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "A racist photograph on the 1984 yearbook page of Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia.An accusation of sexual assault against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax.Both reports \u2014 the first triggering an earthquake in Virginia politics last week, the second setting off an aftershock on Monday \u2014 were originally published by an obscure right-wing news site, Big League Politics, which has promoted conspiracy theories and written favorably about white nationalist candidates.But as mainstream news outlets scrambled to confirm the photograph on Mr. Northam\u2019s medical school yearbook page on Friday, it became clear that Big League Politics \u2014 and its mission of promoting the Trump agenda and nationalist causes \u2014 had assumed outsized influence in an increasingly Democratic state.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]The website has dealt a severe blow to Mr. Northam, who first admitted to posing for the photograph, then reversed himself and has refused to resign despite enormous pressure from fellow Democrats in Virginia and around the nation, throwing his state\u2019s politics into a crisis.A cloud also now hangs over the head of Mr. Fairfax, who would succeed Mr. Northam if he resigns, after Big League Politics published unsubstantiated accusations that he sexually assaulted a woman he met at the Democratic National Convention in 2004.Big League Politics is a relatively new entry to the constellation of right-wing media outlets that sprung up during Donald Trump\u2019s rise, and until the bombshell yearbook report, its readership had remained small.Patrick Howley, the editor in chief, said he received the photograph showing a pair of figures in blackface and Ku Klux Klan robes from a \u201cconcerned citizen,\u201d declining to add more details.But one of Big League Politics\u2019s owners, Noel Fritsch, described the source of the photograph as \u201csome people who were classmates of Northam,\u201d who brought it to light out of anger at the governor\u2019s remarks early last week defending late-term abortions.In its mission statement, Big League Politics purports to be \u201cnot conservative\u201d and \u201cnot liberal,\u201d but it has trafficked in conspiracy theories favored by the far right, like the case of Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staff member whose murder in Washington was falsely seized on by conservative commentators as linked to WikiLeaks.And Mr. Fritsch, a North Carolina-based political consultant, has worked for Paul Nehlen, an anti-Semitic Wisconsin congressional candidate who challenged former House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, and Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate accused of sexual misconduct with teenagers. Last year, Mr. Fritsch was fired as a top aide by Corey Stewart, the Republican senatorial nominee in Virginia, after reports of anti-Muslim comments he had made on social media, as well as saying Senator John McCain \u201csold all his comrades down the river\u201d as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.Mr. Howley, before hanging up his own agitprop shingle, had a rocky tour of duty at some of Washington\u2019s leading conservative news organizations.Provocation is a stock-in-trade for right-wing writers in Washington, but former colleagues said Mr. Howley\u2019s behavior, in public tweets and private emails, went beyond mischief and into darker territory.ImagePeople protested Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia outside his residence in Richmond on Monday.CreditLogan Cyrus/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesHis tenure at The Daily Caller, then overseen by Tucker Carlson, was marred by a vicious online attack directed at a female reporter for BuzzFeed News; Mr. Howley later apologized.Later, at Breitbart News, Mr. Howley earned colleagues\u2019 ire when he questioned the credibility of Michelle Fields, a Breitbart reporter who said she was assaulted by Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, at a Florida rally.Mr. Howley, 29, co-founded Big League Politics in 2017, after deciding that Breitbart, which had aggressively backed Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, had gone soft.\u201cThey got very scared after Trump actually won, which I think the management was not expecting, out of concern for what people would think and toned things down for a while,\u201d he said.In an article in The Daily Caller in 2017, Mr. Howley called the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has claimed the Sandy Hook school massacre was faked, as \u201cbasically my Walter Cronkite now.\u2019\u2019On Sunday night, Big League Politics was the first to publish the accusations the woman aimed at Mr. Fairfax, after they had been privately circulated by both Democrats and Republicans in Richmond, according to people who were sent a screen shot of a private Facebook post by the woman.On Monday, The Washington Post said it had been aware of the accusation for more than a year, and had investigated but declined to publish a story because it could not corroborate the woman\u2019s account or find people she had told about the alleged assault.Mr. Howley defended running the story without trying to verify its truthfulness.\u201cThe fact The Washington Post did not run that despite in other cases running things about Brett Kavanaugh and other people based on thinner sourcing is, I think, a dereliction of duty,\u201d he said.In an overnight response to the story, Mr. Fairfax\u2019s office denied the woman\u2019s accusation and added, \u201cTellingly, not one other reputable media outlet has seen fit to air this false claim.\u201dMainstream Republican operatives said Big League Politics, and similar sites, are friendly places for candidates and campaigns to leak damaging research about political opponents without their fingerprints showing and without the kind of independent scrubbing done in the mainstream press.\u201cThey don\u2019t practice journalism in the traditional sense of trying to tell the story from both sides; they speak to their audience, which is far-right base conservatives and ethno-state types,\u201d said a Republican consultant who has worked extensively in Virginia politics, and asked to remain anonymous to protect professional relationships.Mr. Fritsch, who acquired an ownership interest in Big League Politics in 2018 with another North Carolina-based consultant, Reilly O\u2019Neal, described the mission differently: \u201cTo rip off the mask of the corporate media,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cmany conservative media, so-called conservative members of the media had evidence that was easily verifiable of Ralph Northam\u2019s racism.\u201dIn December, the site received about 550,000 unique visitors, a pittance in the world of online news.

Snap\u2019s daily active users totaled 186 million in the fourth quarter, the same as in the previous quarter and down just one million compared with a year earlier, after two consecutive quarters of falling user numbers. In addition, Snap\u2019s revenue rose 36 percent to $390 million, while its net loss narrowed to $192 million.\u201cChange is always difficult, and this past year was no exception,\u201d Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, said in prepared remarks about the company\u2019s earnings.The financial report, which sent Snap\u2019s shares soaring more than 20 percent in after-hours trading, follows months of turbulence for the company. Since going public in 2017, Snap has been dealing with increasing competition from Facebook, including its core social network and its other apps, such as Instagram and WhatsApp.Last year, Snap redesigned its app, effectively separating social and media into two sections. Its users soon revolted, with celebrities like Kylie Jenner criticizing the change. A long-awaited update to Snapchat\u2019s Android app has also yet to be fully rolled out.More recently, Snap has endured a wave of executive departures. The company said in January that its chief financial officer, Tim Stone, would leave, less than a year after he was hired last May. Imran Khan, Snap\u2019s chief strategy officer, stepped down in September. That same month, the company lost Nick Bell, its vice president for content. Its head of hardware, Sahil Sharma, exited in December.On top of this, Snap is under scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. The company said late last year that it had responded to subpoenas from those agencies regarding disclosures it made ahead of its initial public offering.In an earnings call on Tuesday, Mr. Spiegel said he planned to take time with the search for a new chief financial officer \u201cand really get it right.\u201dHe said Snapchat users on Apple devices were starting to return to the platform and daily active use had increased among those people. Snapchat\u2019s Android app update is also gradually being introduced to a small set of users, allowing them to open the app 20 percent faster, he said. Mr. Spiegel estimated that there were roughly two billion Android users who do not use Snapchat \u2014 and that luring even a small percentage of them to the app would \u201cmake a real difference.\u201dLara Sweet, Snap\u2019s interim chief financial officer, said the company was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that user numbers would not decline in the current quarter. In total, Snap said that it anticipated revenue of $285 million to $310 million during the current quarter.Still, Snap remains small compared with Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing app Instagram, which has been rapidly gaining new users. Facebook announced during its earnings call last week that Instagram had 500 million daily active users of Stories, a feature that lets people share photos and videos that have a life span of 24 hours. Snapchat had pioneered the Stories feature.Wall Street analysts said they were relieved at Snap\u2019s financial results.\u201cThis was by far the most hated stock of all of the internet, by 10 miles,\u201d Brent Thill, a managing director at Jefferies who follows tech companies, said of Snap. \u201cWhat they did was a step in the right direction. They\u2019re not out of this yet, but this is step one.\u201d"}, {"title": "Qatar and Exxon Mobil Plan $10 Billion Gas Investment in Texas", "category": "Business", "id": "b2b7e2d4-b1a1-438d-a828-f8aede07d274", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/business/energy-environment/qatar-exxon-mobil-gas-export.html", "publishdate": 20190205, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/06/business/06GAS/merlin_87249826_64e4e787-cd67-48f8-8ee7-79d19d3cd3a7-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "HOUSTON \u2014 Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil said on Tuesday that they are making a big investment in American natural gas exports. The deal is designed in part to strengthen Qatar\u2019s ties with the United States nearly two years after Saudi Arabia and its allies launched a trade embargo against the country.The companies said they would spend more than $10 billion to turn Golden Pass, a terminal in Texas originally built to import gas, into an export hub for gas extracted from shale fields in Texas, New Mexico and elsewhere.A deeper push into the United States would give state-owned Qatar Petroleum, already the biggest liquefied natural gas exporter in the world, quicker and cheaper access to Latin America, freeing more of its domestic production for lucrative Asian markets.Qatar is also making a bid to strengthen its relationship with the Trump administration, which has established close ties with Saudi Arabia.\u201cFor Qatar, this serves as a counterbalance to the Saudi-U.S. relationship,\u201d said Leslie Palti-Guzman, president of GasVista, a New York-based consulting firm. \u201cSaudi Arabia and Qatar right now are looking to invest in the U.S. liquefied natural gas play, and both think it\u2019s going to carry favor with the Trump administration.\u201dThe administration has attempted periodically to mediate Qatar\u2019s dispute with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Egypt since the Saudi-led bloc cut economic and diplomatic ties with Qatar in 2017. But President Trump has sent conflicting signals about his intentions by, at times, appearing to support Saudi Arabia and its allies in the dispute.Qatar has long leveraged its gas wealth to exert political influence around the Middle East and North Africa, with television broadcasting, financial support for Hamas in Gaza and alliances with Muslim Brotherhood chapters and militia groups around the region. The country also hosts a major American military base.Qatar Petroleum has been a big investor in Golden Pass for years. Originally the giant terminal in Sabine Pass, Tex., was designed to import gas, and cost $2 billion to build about a decade ago. But the frenzy of natural gas drilling in shale fields created a domestic glut, and the facility has been dormant for the last eight years.Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum will reverse some pipelines and add several enormous refrigerant plants to Golden Pass. The plants will cool gas to minus-260 degrees Fahrenheit and condense it into a liquid to be loaded onto tankers and shipped to Latin America, Asia and Europe.Golden Pass is expected to create about 9,000 jobs during five years of construction and 200 permanent positions. The announcement had been delayed for years by regulatory hurdles. In 2017, the Energy Department approved exports from Golden Pass.\u201cGolden Pass will provide an increased, reliable, long-term supply of liquefied natural gas to global gas markets, stimulate local growth and create thousands of jobs,\u201d Exxon Mobil\u2019s chief executive, Darren Woods, said in a statement.Qatar Petroleum will own 70 percent of the project, with Exxon Mobil as its junior partner. The two companies have a long relationship that includes projects in Argentina, Brazil and Mozambique.\u201cThe politics and the economics are aligned,\u201d said Nikos Tsafos, an energy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, referring to Golden Pass.Qatar Petroleum\u2019s footprint is expanding at home and worldwide. In Qatar, it is working with international companies to increase L.N.G. production capacity by more than 40 percent.It is also expanding in Morocco, Cyprus, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa and Mozambique, and has expressed interest in making billions of dollars of additional investments in United States oil and gas production.Much of the money is coming from investments Qatar removed from countries around the Middle East in retaliation for the blockade. In December, the country said it would leave the Saudi-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to focus on its gas business.Qatar is stepping up investments in the United States and elsewhere in response to changes in the global gas market.In the last few years Qatar\u2019s dominance in long-distance shipping of natural gas has been challenged by Australia, and more recently by the United States. Last year, the United States became the fastest growing exporter of liquefied natural gas as the global gas trade increased by 10 percent, primarily because of growing demand in China, Japan and South Korea.The Energy Department projects that American L.N.G. export capacity will increase from 3.6 billion cubic feet a day, to 8.9 billion cubic feet a day by the end of the year, as companies finish several facilities across the Gulf Coast.Natural gas is the fossil fuel with the fastest growing demand worldwide. The number of countries importing L.N.G. has more than doubled to over 40 in the last decade.Asian countries are using gas to replace coal and oil in their power sectors. Thailand and the Philippines are considering L.N.G. imports as a replacement for declining domestic gas production. Many European countries are seeking L.N.G. imports to reduce their dependence on Russia and because gas production on the continent is in decline.\u201cWe see the number of buyers increasing very fast,\u201d said Jean-Baptiste Dubreuil, a senior gas analyst at the International Energy Agency in Paris. \u201cIn most cases, gas is replacing more carbon-intensive fuels, so it\u2019s a positive.\u201dFor Exxon Mobil, the investment marks significantly increased interest in the L.N.G. trade that should fit neatly with its growing investment in oil and gas production in shale fields, particularly in Texas and New Mexico."}, {"title": "The Rise of the Robot Reporter", "category": "Business", "id": "c14c3615-54e0-4dcf-85a8-d32a2e4dc5ce", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/business/media/artificial-intelligence-journalism-robots.html", "publishdate": 20190205, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/business/01AIJournalism-illo/merlin_149984748_d3785a06-51d1-4a38-b979-0ebc6c8be83a-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "As reporters and editors find themselves the victims of layoffs at digital publishers and traditional newspaper chains alike, journalism generated by machine is on the rise.Roughly a third of the content published by Bloomberg News uses some form of automated technology. The system used by the company, Cyborg, is able to assist reporters in churning out thousands of articles on company earnings reports each quarter.The program can dissect a financial report the moment it appears and spit out an immediate news story that includes the most pertinent facts and figures. And unlike business reporters, who find working on that kind of thing a snooze, it does so without complaint.Untiring and accurate, Cyborg helps Bloomberg in its race against Reuters, its main rival in the field of quick-twitch business financial journalism, as well as giving it a fighting chance against a more recent player in the information race, hedge funds, which use artificial intelligence to serve their clients fresh facts.\u201cThe financial markets are ahead of others in this,\u201d said John Micklethwait, the editor in chief of Bloomberg.In addition to covering company earnings for Bloomberg, robot reporters have been prolific producers of articles on minor league baseball for The Associated Press, high school football for The Washington Post and earthquakes for The Los Angeles Times.Examples of machine-generated articles from The Associated Press: TYSONS CORNER, Va. (AP) \u2014 MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter net income of $3.3 million, after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier.MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) \u2014 Jonathan Davis hit for the cycle, as the New Hampshire Fisher Cats topped the Portland Sea Dogs 10-3 on Tuesday.Last week, The Guardian\u2019s Australia edition published its first machine-assisted article, an account of annual political donations to the country\u2019s political parties. And Forbes recently announced that it was testing a tool called Bertie to provide reporters with rough drafts and story templates.As the use of artificial intelligence has become a part of the industry\u2019s toolbox, journalism executives say it is not a threat to human employees. Rather, the idea is to allow journalists to spend more time on substantive work.\u201cThe work of journalism is creative, it\u2019s about curiosity, it\u2019s about storytelling, it\u2019s about digging and holding governments accountable, it\u2019s critical thinking, it\u2019s judgment \u2014 and that is where we want our journalists spending their energy,\u201d said Lisa Gibbs, the director of news partnerships for The A.P.The A.P. was an early adopter when it struck a deal in 2014 with Automated Insights, a technology company specializing in language generation software that produces billions of machine-generated stories a year.In addition to leaning on the software to generate minor league and college game stories, The A.P., like Bloomberg, has used it to beef up its coverage of company earnings reports. Since joining forces with Automated Insights, The A.P. has gone from producing 300 articles on earnings reports per quarter to 3,700.The Post has an in-house robot reporter called Heliograf, which demonstrated its usefulness with its coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games and the 2016 elections. Last year, thanks to Heliograf, The Post won in the category of Excellence in Use of Bots at the annual Global Biggies Awards, which recognize accomplishments in the use of big data and artificial intelligence. (As if to make journalists jittery, the Biggies ceremony took place at Columbia University\u2019s Pulitzer Hall.)Jeremy Gilbert, the director of strategic initiatives at The Post, said the company also used A.I. to promote articles with a local orientation in topics like political races to readers in specific regions \u2014 a practice known as geo-targeting.\u201cWhen you start to talk about mass media, with national or international reach, you run the risk of losing the interest of readers who are interested in stories on their smaller communities,\u201d Mr. Gilbert said. \u201cSo we asked, \u2018How can we scale our expertise?\u2019\u201dThe A.P., The Post and Bloomberg have also set up internal alerts to signal anomalous bits of data. Reporters who see the alert can then determine if there is a bigger story to be written by a human being. During the Olympics, for instance, The Post set up alerts on Slack, the workplace messaging system, to inform editors if a result was 10 percent above or below an Olympic world record.A.I. journalism is not as simple as a shiny robot banging out copy. A lot of work goes into the front end, with editors and writers meticulously crafting several versions of a story, complete with text for different outcomes. Once the data is in \u2014 for a weather event, a baseball game or an earnings report \u2014 the system can create an article.But machine-generated stories are not infallible. For an earnings report article, for instance, software systems may meet their match in companies that cleverly choose figures in an effort to garner a more favorable portrayal than the numbers warrant. At Bloomberg, reporters and editors try to prepare Cyborg so that it will not be spun by such tactics.A.I. in newsrooms may also go beyond the production of rote articles.\u201cI hope we\u2019ll see A.I. tools become a productivity tool in the practice of reporting and finding clues,\u201d said Hilary Mason, the general manager for machine learning at Cloudera, a data management software company. \u201cWhen you do data analysis, you can see anomalies and patterns using A.I. And a human journalist is the right person to understand and figure out.\u201dThe Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones are experimenting with the technology to help with various tasks, including the transcription of interviews or helping journalists identify \u201cdeep fakes,\u201d the convincingly fabricated images generated through A.I.\u201cMaybe a few years ago A.I. was this new shiny technology used by high tech companies, but now it\u2019s actually becoming a necessity,\u201d said Francesco Marconi, the head of research and development at The Journal. \u201cI think a lot of the tools in journalism will soon by powered by artificial intelligence.\u201dThe New York Times said it had no plans for machine-generated news articles, but the company has experimented with using A.I. to personalize newsletters, help with comment moderation and identify images as it digitizes its archive.Previous technological advances have rendered moot a number of jobs that were once essential to the journalism industry, such as Linotype operator. But reporters and editors have not yet been tempted to smash the programs now taking care of some of the busy work that once fell to them.\u201cWhen you look at the ways things are laid out and printed and produced and distributed, a lot of those functions have been replaced with technology,\u201d said Nastaran Mohit, the organizing director for the News Guild of New York. She added that she did not consider A.I. a threat to newsroom workers, while also noting that the guild monitors emerging technologies to make sure that hypothesis holds true.Mr. Marconi of The Journal agreed, likening the addition of A.I. in newsrooms to the introduction of the telephone. \u201cIt gives you more access, and you get more information quicker,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new field, but technology changes. Today it\u2019s A.I., tomorrow it\u2019s blockchain, and in 10 years it will be something else. What does not change is the journalistic standard.\u201dMarc Zionts, the chief executive of Automated Insights, said that machines were a long way from being able to replace flesh-and-blood reporters and editors. He added that his daughter was a journalist in South Dakota \u2014 and although he had not advised her to leave her job, he had told her to get acquainted with the latest technology.\u201cIf you are a non-learning, non-adaptive person \u2014 I don\u2019t care what business you\u2019re in \u2014 you will have a challenging career,\u201d Mr. Zionts said.For Patch, a nationwide news organization devoted to local news, A.I. provides an assist to its 110 staff reporters and numerous freelancers who cover about 800 communities, especially in their coverage of the weather. In a given week, more than 3,000 posts on Patch \u2014 5 to 10 percent of its output \u2014 are machine-generated, said the company\u2019s chief executive, Warren St. John.In addition to giving reporters more time to pursue their interests, machine journalism comes with an added benefit for editors.\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve noticed,\u201d Mr. St. John said, \u201cis that our A.I.-written articles have zero typos.\u201d"}, {"title": "Biggest Public Company?

And so the day went, the two tech titans going back and forth, until trading ended with Microsoft the leader at a market value of $823 billion.The positions of Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon have been flip-flopping since the wipeout in the iPhone maker\u2019s stock price late last year. The mantle has changed hands seven times among the three companies. Three of those switches have taken place over the past week as the big tech companies reported quarterly results. And Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) has lurked not far behind the whole time.The competition reflects the global economic concerns hanging over the markets as well as the changing technology landscape, and it\u2019s a shift from past years. Apple passed Exxon Mobil to become the most valuable company in the United States almost eight years ago, and after 2012 it held on, largely unchallenged, for six years.The company\u2019s ascension was a precursor to Big Tech\u2019s takeover of the stock market. Investors scooped up shares of the largest tech companies, believing their sales growth was unassailable, and by the second half of 2016, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple were the five most valuable companies in the S&P 500.But investors\u2019 faith in Big Tech began to weaken last year. Apple fell hard as signs of a mature mobile phone market, a softening global economy and a trade war between China and the United States raised doubts about the company\u2019s ability to sell more iPhones.Nearly $450 billion was wiped off its market value \u2014 an amount greater than all but six companies in the S&P 500.Shares of the other tech titans fell as well. But Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet have fared far better than Apple and the broader market over the past year, as bets by the first two \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, by Alphabet \u2014 on cloud computing drove a surge in revenue.Microsoft and Apple, which has recovered some of its losses since it reported earnings last week, are both valued at a little more than $820 billion. Behind them are Amazon, at $815 billion, and Alphabet, at $797 billion.In fifth place is Warren E. Buffett\u2019s investment conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway.

He does know where he thinks he\u2019ll find the answer: behind the wheel. In a series of posts on Medium, Mr. O\u2019Rourke has detailed his somewhat aimless recent travels \u2014 seeing sights, thinking thoughts, dining with strangers \u2014 in a confessional style uncommon among presidential contenders. Supporters have cheered his transparency and willingness to appear vulnerable. Skeptics believe the entries have reinforced a caricature of Mr. O\u2019Rourke as a politician with his head in the clouds. (\u201cSkateboarding man-child,\u201d the columnist George Will sniffed recently.)Below is his Medium post from Jan. 16, and an annotated look at what he might be trying to say:A lot of big trucks rolling down Pancake Blvd and there aren\u2019t any sidewalks. Gloomy early morning sky in Liberal Kansas. Snow melt on the side of the road where I\u2019m running. I find a vacant lot to cut through to another street, also busy and without sidewalks. I finally get to a smaller road that goes past a mobile home park, then a small subdivision, and out into corn fields to my right and empty fields to my left.Mr. O\u2019Rourke is establishing his preferred visual quickly: He is on the road. It\u2019s where he\u2019s been most comfortable as a candidate, hitting each of Texas\u2019s 254 counties during his 2018 Senate run and capturing minutiae \u2014 usually by live-stream, not blog. But the history goes deeper. \u201cHe loves him a road trip,\u201d said an ex-girlfriend, Katherine Raymond, remembering a few from college. I was in Tucumcari yesterday. Trying to learn more about the town that my great-grandparents lived in more than a hundred years ago. James O\u2019Rourke, son of Irish immigrants, and Anna Lloyd who immigrated to the U.S. from Wales. According to the 1910 census they lived at 1710 Second Street.I stayed at the Motel Safari, one of these classic Route 66 motels. Mid-century everything. I talked to the owner for a bit. He moved from Tennessee and away from corporate life. Starting over. It\u2019s hard not to see parallels here to Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s own past. His professional arc has frequently been an exercise in starting over: Adrift in New York City years after graduating college, he returned to El Paso. Restless in business, he tried politics. Unsatisfied with a safe House seat, he set off on a long-shot Senate bid. Giving himself to this hotel that he bought a couple years back. Hasn\u2019t taken a break in more than a year, but is going to close down for the month of February, spend some time back in Tennessee. Take a break, come back stronger. Mr. O\u2019Rourke is plainly trying to do the same. He has spoken often of the exhaustion that has lingered well after his Senate campaign ended. If he is to seek the presidency, now is the moment when he hopes to recharge.Ate at Del\u2019s and as I was finishing my blackberry cobbler asked the waitress what I should see in Tucumcari. The murals, the sights on 66. And you should check out this lake, exactly 12 miles from Tucumcari on 54.The next morning I ran. Just a couple of miles. Down 66, then through neighborhoods, past the History Museum. My leg has really been bothering me since the campaign and so I had stopped running for a while. This was my first run in more than a month. Felt good, running in new shoes.[Read about Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s life in New York City as a young man]Have been stuck lately. In and out of a funk. My last day of work was January 2nd. It\u2019s been more than twenty years since I was last not working. Maybe if I get moving, on the road, meet people, learn about what\u2019s going on where they live, have some adventure, go where I don\u2019t know and I\u2019m not known, it\u2019ll clear my head, reset, I\u2019ll think new thoughts, break out of the loops I\u2019ve been stuck in. The subtext here is more like text: Mr. O\u2019Rourke is, by his admission, in a bit of a rut. It\u2019s an uncommon admission for someone weighing a White House run.After breakfast at a diner down from the Safari, I drove over to Mesalands Community College. Met this amazing young man named Dylan, originally from Washington state, who had traveled from Amarillo to Tucumcari carrying his belongings, water and food in a wheelbarrow. He\u2019d seen the wind turbine that stands in front of Meslands, inquired within and soon enrolled. He\u2019s now the president of the student body and was my guide for the morning.He introduced me to the instructors, the head of the wind energy club, and his fellow students. I learned about how they are learning. Had a chance to introduce myself, asked questions about the program they\u2019re in, about Tucumcari, about where they\u2019re originally from. About how what they\u2019re doing fits into the larger picture \u2014 climate change, economic opportunity, infrastructure investment. How it fits into their picture \u2014 the job they\u2019re looking for, the purpose they want, the opportunity that\u2019s opened up for them. What it\u2019s like to climb that high, to use a wrench for the first time in your life, to know that you\u2019re on a track and that there\u2019s a destination.A younger Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u2014 and perhaps the present-day version \u2014 might envy the students\u2019 sense of direction. Casting about for professional purpose after college, Mr. O\u2019Rourke said he fell into the deepest depression of his life.Learned about pump storage, battery technology, the role that production tax credits have had in making New Mexico a leader in wind energy production.What do they make after graduation? Wind techs start off making $19\u201323/hr though not uncommon for some to make six figures within the first year. They graduate from the program and are hired. Students I met had traveled from throughout the southwest to come here. It\u2019s a good program and leads to a solid, highly paid job.As Beto O\u2019Rourke Weighs 2020 Run, Democrats Chafe at His Go-It-Alone StyleJan. 19, 2019Beto O\u2019Rourke Dreams of One Texas. Ted Cruz Sees Another Clearly.Aug. 31, 2018Beto O\u2019Rourke Says He Isn\u2019t Ruling Out 2020 Presidential BidNov. 26, 2018Everyone I met was proud. Really into what they were doing. The instructors, the staff, the students. Dylan came across as a born leader \u2014 confident, humble, thoughtful and full of purpose.Outside as we concluded the tour of the campus I looked up and imagined the courage it takes to climb out onto the face of these giant turbines, 250 feet up in the air. I said goodbye to Dylan, Jose, Brandon and the others. As politicians go, Mr. O\u2019Rourke is hardly unique in name-checking the locals he encounters. But he is among the more prolific. His town hall events last year frequently began with a lengthy recitation of people he met, where he\u2019d met them and what he ate in the towns where he met them.I drove to 1710 Second Street. It\u2019s now a First National Bank parking lot. Went to the Tucumcari library to see if I could find anything about James and Anna and what was going on in 1910. I didn\u2019t, but saw a book the community had put together honoring those who were killed in World War II. At the reading table a group of older men were gathered, talking politics, in Spanish and in English. Seemed to be a regular get together. Those jokers in Washington D.C. Why didn\u2019t Hillary do this? Or that? And Trump! Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s uncle remembered him once musing about how nice it would be to run a kind of gathering spot for political dialogue. \u201cI want to have that burrito store,\u201d the uncle, Brooks Williams, recalled Mr. O\u2019Rourke saying once. \u201cI want to have that place downtown where politicians come in and talk.\u201dDrove out to the lake the waitress had told me about. Had it all to myself and some ducks. Found some crab claws. Maybe left by a bird. Walked out on a pier. Looked out, took some pictures. Leaned over, scooped up water and washed my face. Picked up beer cans that someone had left and were blown into the bushes. Later learned that it\u2019s called Ute Lake. Formed by damming the Canadian River.Drove to Dalhart. Ate at the Grill. Was last there in August of 2017. Green chile cheeseburger. The table over asked if I was Beto. We talked about the campaign, about Dalhart. Talked about the livestock show they were on their way to.Dropped in at the VA clinic to say hello to the team there. I had visited in 2017 and they\u2019d really made an impression on me. A staff of two and a visiting doctor take care of veterans from a huge area \u2014 including parts of Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Kansas and New Mexico.They seemed well and I got back in the truck, drove on, thinking about this story I\u2019d read the night before about a veteran who comes back home by George Saunders. I read it twice, because it was so good and also because I wasn\u2019t totally sure that I understood what happened at the end of it. Had so many thoughts and questions about it. Not completely spelled out, not neatly defined and tied up. Wanted to talk to someone about it and maybe understand it better from their perspective. I called Kate. She saw the ending differently than I did. More of an epiphany, less of a catastrophe. We were cut off by bad service and finished the conversation by text later in the day.In a recent interview, Mr. O\u2019Rourke, an English major at Columbia University, detailed some pieces of literature that had made him think through the years: Greek tragedies (\u201cthe Greeks got me, man\u201d), a Proust work (\u201cman, it was powerful\u201d) and the autobiography of Woody Guthrie.I got to Goodwell and right away saw the sign for Oklahoma Panhandle State University on my left. Turned in and met Teri who was waiting for me. I had decided that morning that I\u2019d stop in Goodwell and we\u2019d reached out to see if anyone would like to meet. She showed me to a lecture hall where there were about 40\u201350 students and faculty.We talked about everything and anything that anyone wanted to talk about. First question: Why in the world was I in Goodwell?It\u2019s on 54, and that\u2019s the road I started on in El Paso. Never been to Goodwell and wanted to see what was here and who lived here and what they were thinking.We talked about healthcare. About war and veterans. We talked about the border and immigration and Dreamers. We talked about corporate influence in politics, PACs and election finance. We talked about how hard it is to afford college. A recruiter for OPSU told me about the anxiety she encounters among kids in high school who don\u2019t think they\u2019ll ever have the money to come here.Listened to a young woman who is studying to be a teacher, wants to teach kindergarten. Asked me how we improve the chances for children of color who are suspended and expelled at up to five times the rate of white children as early as kindergarten. Someone else asked about the criminal justice system and the disproportionate number of black men and women behind bars.Critics of Mr. O\u2019Rourke have at times rolled their eyes at his tendency to identify problems without always proposing firm solutions. This was rarely an issue in his Senate race, when Democrats were so united against his Republican opponent, Senator Ted Cruz, but could be a problem in a presidential primary.We talked about bringing the country together. Talked about national service, more young people finding purpose and common cause with their fellow Americans helping to rebuild the country \u2014 serving in whatever capacity helps to make this country stronger \u2014 infrastructure and public works, blazing and keeping trails into the wild, serving veterans and supporting teachers in the classroom. Being together, working together, for this country.A young woman asked, how do I make a difference in any of this? I said run for office. Hold town hall meetings. Bring people together, over coffee, over beer, ask your elected reps to show up and be part of the conversation. If they don\u2019t, organize to get their attention. But whatever we do, let\u2019s do it together. Listen to each other, be respectful, decent, kind. Invite those who don\u2019t agree with you and try to see it their way for a minute. Make this democracy work by being as engaged as you possibly can. Otherwise we\u2019ll lose it.Here is the core of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s appeal to supporters: His common-cause pitch is a temperamental (and generational) contrast to President Trump. The meeting broke up, and I had a chance to talk to some of the people who stayed after. The gentleman who\u2019d asked me about corporate money in politics introduced me to his wife. She was wearing a rainbow-colored wig. She explained her kids pick out the wig she\u2019ll wear each day. She\u2019s fighting cancer right now. She wanted to tell me about how fortunate she feels to be able to get the care that she needs. Because she has friends without insurance who go without, completely. And friends who have insurance but are fighting the insurance company at the same time they are fighting their cancer. Missing treatments as they fight for the care they\u2019d been paying for in their premiums. I was moved that she\u2019d tell me about her life, about how she feels about what\u2019s happening to others. I could tell it wasn\u2019t easy, maybe there was some hesitation in being so open. But I was glad that I could stay as long as anyone wanted to stay and talk.I left and it was dark. I drove to Liberal. Thought about continuing through to somewhere else but then was hungry and getting tired. Found a small motel, the Southwinds and pulled in. As he was taking care of another customer in front of me, the owner looked up and said \u201cYou look like the guy who ran for senate in Texas!\u201dWe talked for a while, he told me about his family and then called them in from a living room that was connected to the front office. His son was about to get on a train to go back to college in Kansas City. Come to KC, that\u2019s where it\u2019s at! His cousin was in from Sugar Land. I asked how much a room was and he said it was nothing. I thanked him and drove across the parking lot to park in front of room 29. I took my suitcase in, a clean, comfortable room.I would like Beto O\u2019Rourke to negotiate all my future hotel stays."}, {"title": "Are Your Children Racking Up Charges From Mobile Games?

Some Facebook employees internally referred to these children as \u201cwhales,\u201d a term typically used by casinos to describe the highest of high rollers.The report follows actions by the Federal Trade Commission five years ago that required Apple and Google to issue millions of dollars in refunds to parents whose children made unauthorized in-app charges. In 2017, the F.T.C. made a similar arrangement with Amazon. At the heart of all of this are mobile games that persuade children \u2014 who are the most vulnerable \u2014 to buy virtual goods using their parents\u2019 credit card accounts while they are playing. It has become such an issue that these games have been called \u201cbait apps\u201d in class-action lawsuits.So what can adults do to prevent their children from falling prey to bait apps and running up their credit card bills?Unfortunately, preventing unwanted in-app purchases is far from straightforward. Many young ones are clever about finding workarounds when they are blocked. And tech companies typically don\u2019t have much incentive to invest in safeguards because these purchases generate revenue.Jim Steyer, who runs the nonprofit Common Sense Media, said fighting bait apps is often confusing. Even though his group reviews tech products for families and suggests limits on tech, he himself often has to call tech companies to reverse charges made by his 14-year-old son inside apps like Fortnite, the popular shooter game.\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on the tech companies who are selling you these apps and games to make it much easier for parents,\u201d Mr. Steyer said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really unfair to assume that the average parent is tech savvy.\u201dTo come up with some solutions, I gathered many gadgets in my household \u2014 including devices from Apple, Google and Amazon \u2014 to devise a guide to fighting bait apps. Here\u2019s what you should know.AppleLet\u2019s start with Apple, the maker of many of our devices and a purveyor of mobile games through its App Store. It offers several effective tools for restricting in-app payments on iPhones, iPads and the iPod Touch.One is Ask to Buy, a set of controls that requires a parent to approve each app purchase on a child\u2019s device. It can be set up with the following steps:A parent first sets up a family sharing account, by going into the settings app, selecting \u201cset up family sharing\u201d and following the instructions. The parent then sends an invitation to the child\u2019s Apple device to join the family account. (If the child doesn\u2019t have an Apple ID, the parent can create one and add it to the family group.)Then, the parent goes into the family sharing settings, selects the child\u2019s account and turns on Ask to Buy. It notifies the parent\u2019s device whenever the child tries to buy an app or something inside an app. The parent can approve or reject the purchases.You can also disable in-app payments on Apple devices altogether. Here\u2019s how:On the child\u2019s device settings, choose \u201cscreen time\u201d and select \u201cthis is my child\u2019s iPhone.\u201dSet a secret passcode and then tap \u201ccontent & privacy restrictions.\u201d From here, tap \u201ciTunes & App Store purchases.\u201dThen choose \u201cin-app purchases\u201d and select \u201cdon\u2019t allow.\u201dAn Apple spokeswoman said the company designed the controls to \u201cprovide families easy ways to stay informed about kids\u2019 screen time, set appropriate limits and approve their downloads and purchases.\u201dGoogleGoogle\u2019s tool for managing a child\u2019s app purchases on Android devices is incomplete compared with Apple\u2019s. Google offers a parental control tool called Family Link, which includes a setting for requiring parental approval for app purchases. But children can choose to leave Family Link once they turn 13 and remove the restrictions \u2014 a limitation I have criticized in the past.While I do not recommend Family Link for managing a child\u2019s app purchases, here\u2019s an alternative method that is more reliable for regulating in-app payments on Android devices:On your child\u2019s Android device, set a password for the Google account that is used for making purchases from Google Play, which is the Android app store. Open the Google Play Store app on the child\u2019s device. Tap the hamburger menu (an icon with three lines) and scroll down to settings. Tap on the \u201crequire authentication for purchases\u201d option. Then select \u201call purchases.\u201dWith this setting turned on, you will have to enter your password whenever the child tries to buy an app or goods inside an app. As long as you set a strong password and keep it secret, the child should not be able to make purchases. This solution is imperfect because the child will need to use a separate Google account and password for unrelated tasks, like email, but it is more reliable than Family Link because the restriction won\u2019t expire when the child turns 13. Google declined to comment.FacebookThe process for blocking in-app payments on Facebook is the most lacking and the most confusing, I found.That\u2019s because people can make purchases in games on the social network and on its family of apps \u2014 which include Facebook Messenger \u2014 in a dizzying variety of ways. Children can spend in games loaded inside Facebook\u2019s mobile apps, which include Facebook and Facebook Messenger, or on a computer using Facebook.com. That means if your children are racking up charges inside Facebook\u2019s iPhone apps, the aforementioned Apple tools will help. If they are spending inside Facebook\u2019s Android apps, the Google solution above might stop them. But if they are buying things inside games on the Facebook website on a computer, there is no direct tool to prevent payments. The best you can do is to go into your child\u2019s Facebook account and remove your payment method from it.In other words, if a minor failed to buy something inside a game using a Facebook mobile app, he or she could go on a computer and use the website to make the purchase, so long as your credit card was handy. This is a glaring loophole. When I called Facebook about it, a spokeswoman pointed me to its Parents Portal, which includes guidelines on how parents can talk to their children about how they use the web.Facebook does have a process for disputing charges and requesting refunds, in the games support section of Facebook. When you visit the web tool, select \u201cprocess a refund,\u201d click \u201cpurchase made by someone under 18 years old\u201d and then choose the unauthorized game.AmazonAmazon offers games for its Fire tablets along with a range of controls for restricting app payments on those devices, which require a password to make purchases. It also offers Amazon FreeTime, which automatically blocks minors from content inside its app store.Here\u2019s how the parental controls work:On the tablet, open the Amazon Appstore app.From there, select \u201caccount\u201d and then tap \u201csettings.\u201d Then tap \u201cparental controls\u201d and select \u201cenable parental controls.\u201d With this setting turned on, the Amazon account password will be required to make in-app purchases.And here\u2019s how to set up FreeTime:Swipe down from the top of the screen and select \u201csettings,\u201d and then tap \u201cprofiles & family library.\u201dChoose \u201cadd a child profile\u201d and create a lock-screen PIN, which your child will not have access to.From the \u201cadd child profile\u201d screen, select \u201cchoose a profile picture\u201d to add a profile picture. Enter your child\u2019s name, birth date and gender.From here, you can choose \u201cuse Amazon FreeTime,\u201d which is suited for children, or \u201cuse teen profiles,\u201d which has an aesthetic more suited for teenagers. (Either one will automatically block in-app purchases.)Tap \u201cadd profile\u201d and choose the content you want available on the child\u2019s profile. Then tap \u201cdone.\u201dFortniteFortnite is an important example of an app that is widely available across many devices. It is popular with children, who want to spend inside the game to buy different items like outfits to make their Fortnite characters look unique. The problem is that even if you prevent your children from buying virtual items inside Fortnite on an iPhone, they might make the purchases elsewhere, like on a PlayStation, Xbox or Nintendo console.To prevent that, you will have to be thorough. Assess which products are in your home, and then set up the parental controls for each device, like the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.A spokesman for Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, declined to comment, pointing to the parental controls offered by device makers. Users can also request refunds for unauthorized Fortnite purchases on the company\u2019s website.If tech fails, then what?So here\u2019s what I learned: Fighting bait apps is a lot of work. But when tech fails, parents can always turn to a free tool: disciplining and educating their children. Mr. Steyer of Common Sense Media said he eventually had to teach his teenage son a lesson for his Fortnite splurging. How? He took the game console away.\u201cIt does give you a teachable moment to sit down with your kid and talk about being responsible financially, and that you don\u2019t have my permission to spend the money,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "Chief of Apple Stores Is Leaving After 5 Years in the Job", "category": "Business", "id": "485e02d1-dfdb-4b05-9483-32fbf43ef76f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/technology/apple-stores-angela-ahrendts.html", "publishdate": 20190206, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/business/06apple/merlin_107963495_c0f0e5dd-0181-4a2a-ad8b-11b187615515-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Angela Ahrendts, the former Burberry chief hired by Apple five years ago to oversee its stores, said Tuesday that she would leave the company in April.The departure is an unusual move for a top executive at Apple, which is facing retail challenges as sales in China have dropped and iPhone sales have turned sluggish.Ms. Ahrendts, 58, was one of Apple\u2019s most prominent hires when the Silicon Valley company lured her from Burberry with an initial $73 million pay package in 2014. She had spent eight years as Burberry\u2019s chief executive and was credited with expanding it into an international fashion brand.Over five years, Ms. Ahrendts was among Apple\u2019s highest-paid executives, earning more than $170 million, according to securities filings.Apple said in a news release that she was leaving \u201cfor new personal and professional pursuits.\u201dOne of Ms. Ahrendts\u2019s primary goals was to improve Apple\u2019s online retail operation so it was as admired as its sleek, minimalist stores. She generally succeeded, allowing customers, for example, to order online and pick up items in a store, said Neil Cybart, an independent Apple analyst.Mr. Cybart said that Apple\u2019s stores remained among the most lucrative in the world by square foot, and that traffic to them had been steady.\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily see any huge red flags,\u201d he said while discussing the circumstances of Ms. Ahrendts\u2019s exit.Under Ms. Ahrendts, Apple started offering more public talks, concerts and seminars at its stores in an attempt to draw in customers who weren\u2019t necessarily in the market for a new device.\u201cIt\u2019s funny. We actually don\u2019t call them stores anymore,\u201d Ms. Ahrendts said at an Apple event in 2017. \u201cWe call them town squares.\u201d She was later criticized for suggesting that a store with $1,000 products could be a community gathering place.Ms. Ahrendts said in a statement that \u201cthe last five years have been the most stimulating, challenging and fulfilling of my career.\u201dDeirdre O\u2019Brien, Apple\u2019s human resources chief, will take over management of the retail operation in addition to her current duties, the company said. She has worked for Apple for three decades.Ms. O\u2019Brien, 52, is a surprising choice as the new retail chief, given her already heavy load handling human resources for more than 100,000 employees. She will add responsibilities that include \u201cstrategy, real estate and development, and operations of Apple\u2019s physical stores, Apple\u2019s online store and contact centers,\u201d according to Apple\u2019s website.Apple was probably willing to give her such a large role to keep retail in the hands of a company veteran, Mr. Cybart said.Apple operates 506 stores on five continents, about a 25 percent increase since Ms. Ahrendts was hired. Mr. Cybart said Apple had recently increased its focus on adding stores in prominent locations in major cities like Chicago and Milan.Two Wedbush Securities analysts, Daniel Ives and Strecker Backe, said in a research note that one of Ms. O\u2019Brien\u2019s focuses would be stimulating demand in China, where the retail experience is important.They said they were encouraged that Apple had chosen Ms. O\u2019Brien over an outside hire, given the company\u2019s recent struggles.\u201cWhile the timing of this departure is a head scratcher, change could be a good thing for Apple, as the last year has been nothing to write home about,\u201d they wrote."}, {"title": "Stacey Abrams Isn\u2019t Running for President.

And her well-received speech Tuesday evening will most likely intensify the current efforts by national party leaders to recruit Ms. Abrams to run for Senate in 2020.But some of her supporters and other Democrats are also asking whether she should be running for an even bigger position \u2014 and why the clamoring has been louder for some white male politicians to run than for her.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Democrats are facing a rare, wide-open presidential nomination contest, and questions of ideology, tone and identity are already beginning to rattle a growing list of hopefuls who have been apologizing for past positions or statements. During her campaign last year and in her remarks Tuesday night, Ms. Abrams\u2019s ability to articulate an uncompromising liberal message while also blending themes of unity and togetherness impressed both ardent leftists and Democrats more toward the political center \u2014 a rare combination in such polarizing times.\u201cOur most urgent work is to realize Americans\u2019 dreams of today and tomorrow,\u201d Ms. Abrams said. \u201cTo carve a path to independence and prosperity that can last a lifetime.\u201dShe also made several calls for working with Republicans.\u201cCompassionate treatment at the border is not the same as open borders,\u201d she said. \u201cPresident Reagan understood this. President Obama understood this. Americans understand this. And Democrats stand ready to effectively secure our ports and borders.\u201d[Read a transcript of Ms. Abrams\u2019s speech.]Mr. Pfeiffer, the former Obama adviser, said in an email after his tweet: \u201cI have no idea if she can win the nomination, but neither does anyone else.\u201d\u201cWhat I do know is that she can inspire people to activism and that is key to a Democrat winning back the White House,\u201d he said.Ms. Abrams, the 45-year-old former Georgia House minority leader who lost her bid for the governor\u2019s mansion by fewer than 60,000 votes, focused her remarks on themes that have been the focus of her political career \u2014 expanding voting rights and health care and working on bipartisan issues like criminal justice reform, access to education, and transportation improvements. But in doing so, as she stood in front of a diverse group of women and men at a labor union center in Atlanta, she gave national Democrats a glimpse of why Georgia liberals have long called her the \u201cfuture of the Democratic Party.\u201d\u201cShe has certainly earned the right to be taken seriously as a national player,\u201d said the Rev.

The field, already the most diverse in history, could soon be adding new faces: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who plans to announce her 2020 decision on Sunday, and two previous candidates, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who are considering running again.Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman, has received substantial presidential buzz since losing his 2018 Senate race against the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz, even landing an interview with Oprah Winfrey on Tuesday as part of a celebrity slate that included actors like Michael B. Jordan and Bradley Cooper.But some Democrats say it is Ms. Abrams, not Mr. O\u2019Rourke, who was the breakout candidate from the 2018 midterms who should be generating presidential speculation. (Ms. Winfrey, to be sure, was a strong supporter of Ms. Abrams\u2019s bid for governor last year.)\u201cIf folks are looking at Beto because he ran in a red state differently, or because he inspired millions of people in his state and many more out of the state \u2014 if it\u2019s because he ran a different type of candidacy where he went to every region of the state and spoke the same type of vision \u2014 then surely Stacey Abrams meets and exceeds that standard,\u201d said Maurice Mitchell, the national director for the progressive Working Families Party.\u201cI find it perplexing that more pundits and more of the political establishment aren\u2019t discussing Stacey in the same breath that they discuss Beto,\u201d he said.The openness to more candidates reflects the restiveness among many Democratic voters who fear that none of their current and likely candidates can appease all of the party\u2019s ideological factions, which are sometimes bitterly opposed.More liberal candidates such as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mr. Sanders have energized the party\u2019s anti-Wall Street wing with their desire to rein in unchecked capitalism, but have upset social justice advocates in recent months with high-profile blunders on issues of race and identity. Candidates seen as more centrist, including Senators Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, have run afoul of some liberals for their unwillingness to directly target large corporations and wealthy Americans in their economic policies.Mr. O\u2019Rourke has intrigued some longtime party officials because he could possibly excite both groups of Democrats. But his liberal record has been questioned by liberal hard-liners in recent weeks as his voting history in the House has received additional scrutiny. And while his response to a question about black football players protesting police brutality went viral on social media during the midterm elections, it remains unknown whether a white man can be nominated to lead a Democratic Party that is, in 2020, increasingly reliant on votes from women and racial minorities \u2014 and particularly women of color.\u201cPeople try to serve as gatekeepers, and say \u2018this person looks like a kind of candidate we could back,\u2019\u201d said Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People, a political network of progressive women. \u201cBut, for me, from the very beginning, I looked at Stacey Abrams and said \u2018this she is exactly what the country needs.\u2019\u201dMs. Abrams has indicated that she intends to run for public office again, but her advisers in Georgia said she had yet to make a decision about when or which office to pursue. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, have implored her to run in 2020 against Senator David Perdue, a Republican, but longtime friends said Ms. Abrams had long had her heart set on being governor.For Ms. Abrams\u2019s backers, it\u2019s not only her identity as a black woman that excites them, but that she ran a campaign in Georgia that was built on liberal promises such as expanding access to Medicaid and access to affordable college for in-state students. For Kimberly Peeler-Allen, a co-founder of Higher Heights, a political group focused on engaging black women, the party\u2019s decision to select Ms. Abrams to speak Tuesday night was a step in the right direction.\u201cI think having a black woman deliver the response really sends a message to the Democratic Party, and particularly to black women,\u201d she said. \u201cIt says that at least in this moment, they see us and hear us and they want us to be part of the broader narrative of what it means to follow a democratic ideal.\u201dShe said that message did not come across in the two previous Democratic responses to Mr. Trump\u2019s annual address.Last year, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts delivered the State of the Union response in from a car factory in New England, speaking partly in Spanish but largely focusing on issues of the economy.And in 2017, Steve Beshear, a former Kentucky governor, delivered the party\u2019s response from a no-frills diner with a stoic crowd behind him. During Mr. Beshear\u2019s speech, every pictured person surrounding him was white.As for Ms. Abrams, the crowd behind her was racially diverse and featured more women than men, and blended liberal priorities with bipartisan appeals."}, {"title": "For Car Buyers Who Got a Lemon, State Laws Vary Widely", "category": "Business", "id": "4dde1693-24e3-4e93-ae53-68dad4eca3d3", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/automobiles/car-lemon-laws-states.html", "publishdate": 20190206, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/08/business/08wheels-lemon/merlin_135143076_4ee1a38d-23ee-407c-80f5-79b92754d4eb-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Motorists who live in New Jersey and have a major problem with a new vehicle have a handy tool: the best lemon law in the land. But about a third of the states have such weak lemon laws that consumers will have a tough time getting a fair deal, according to a study released this month by the Center for Auto Safety.All 50 states and the District of Columbia have \u201csomething that is arguably a lemon law,\u201d but too many fail consumers, said Jason Levine, the executive director of the center, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization founded by Ralph Nader.In the worst states, Mr. Levine said, there might as well be no lemon law on the books.The states differ on what constitutes a lemon. But in general, a lemon car or truck has a single, serious defect impairing its safety, use or value. A vehicle could also be a lemon if it had a series of problems and could not be used for a long period \u2014 often set at 30 days \u2014 because it was at the dealership.Given the cost of new vehicles, consumers should be angry that too many states \u201chave decided they are not going to give anything but mediocre rights\u201d to consumers, said Ronald Burdge, a lawyer from Dayton, Ohio, whose firm has specialized in lemon laws for decades.That weakness is compounded because attorneys general are often not given the funding they need to help consumers who have bought a lemon, he said.The International Association of Lemon Law Administrators declined to comment on the study. The executive director, Rick Soletski, said the association\u2019s policy was to have each state comment individually on such matters.Typically, lemon-law claims do not require a lawyer and are instead handled by an arbitration board that may be chosen by the automaker or the state. For autos deemed lemons, the manufacturer is required to buy them back. There is, however, no national data on how many cars the makers buy back. Under weaker laws, the owner may have to pay for the miles driven.The center\u2019s rankings are based on 10 factors, including how many repair attempts are required, the amount of time lost while the dealer has the vehicle and whether arbitration is state-run.New Jersey claimed the top spot in part because it pushes the automaker to fix a problem quickly. The automaker gets only one chance to fix \u201ca serious safety defect likely to cause death or serious bodily injury\u201d and three chances to fix a less-severe problem. It also provides state-run arbitration, which the center contends can be \u201cfairer to consumers than the manufacturer arbitration programs.\u201d And a vehicle can\u2019t be out of service for more than 20 days.New York ranked sixth. It earned high marks for not allowing an automaker to charge a customer for use under 12,000 miles.Illinois was ranked last, with a major criticism being that it lacks a penalty for an automaker that drags out the process, hoping the consumer will become frustrated and give up. Illinois also covers vehicles for only one year or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first. The center said there were also \u201ca host of other deficiencies that can lead to a bitter outcome for consumers.\u201dAnnie Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Illinois attorney general, said the office would review the center\u2019s report. Meanwhile, \u201cwe encourage consumers to visit the attorney general\u2019s website to file a complaint, and we will attempt to mediate,\u201d she said.The center also looked at whether consumers face any jeopardy by filing a lemon law complaint.That\u2019s one reason that Colorado was ranked next to last. If a consumer sues an automaker over the lemon law and loses, the judge could make the consumer pay the automaker\u2019s legal bills.It works both ways.If the consumer wins, the judge could order the automaker to pay the consumer\u2019s bills. But a consumer may just give up rather than risk a big legal bill, Mr. Levine said.Lawrence Pacheco, the director of communications for the Colorado attorney general, had no comment on the ranking.For consumers, a related and historically worrisome issue is interstate lemon laundering, said Rosemary Shahan, the president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, a nonprofit in Sacramento.When a vehicle is repurchased by the automaker, Ms. Shahan said, not all states mark the title with its lemon status. That lets an automaker sell the vehicle again without the new buyer knowing its troubled history, she said.In 1996, the Federal Trade Commission considered requiring all states to mark the titles of lemons. But faced with opposition from the auto industry, the agency backed off.\u201cThe F.T.C. failed to act, and still fails to act, to protect the public from lemons with serious defects,\u201d Ms. Shahan said."}, {"title": "Trump Loves the New Nafta.

The deal, he argued, will help American farmers and workers and ensure \u201cthat more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words: Made in the U.S.A.\u201dBut the pact, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement, is currently imperiled in Congress, and both Democrats and Republicans say it has little chance of passing without significant changes. Democrats say the deal does not go far enough to protect workers and the environment, while Republicans say it goes too far in restricting trade, particularly in the auto sector.The stalemate has some business leaders increasingly worried that the administration lacks a winning strategy to move the revised deal through a divided Congress, in a year when a prolonged government shutdown has further eroded what little inclination Democrats and Republicans had to work together on large pieces of legislation.\u201cPartisan rancor has made it more difficult to see any kind of major legislation move forward, including on trade,\u201d said John Murphy, senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said late last week that he was \u201cdoubtful\u201d that the deal, also known as the U.S.M.C.A., would pass Congress given the concerns from both sides of the aisle.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to see how it\u2019s a priority for Nancy Pelosi to give Donald Trump what would be his biggest economic policy victory, certainly since tax reform,\u201d Mr. Toomey, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal critics on trade, said in an interview.Privately, some congressional Democrats remain hopeful that the agreement can pass, particularly if negotiations with the administration continue to fly under the radar. Mr. Trump must still submit the agreement \u2014 along with legislation laying out how it would be put in place \u2014 to Congress.And administration officials continue to insist that the deal will ultimately get approved. \u201cWe are confident that Congress will approve U.S.M.C.A.,\u201d a spokesman for the United States trade representative said in an email. \u201cIt was negotiated in close consultation with Democrats and Republicans, and enjoys overwhelming support from the business community and farm groups.\u201dBut big hurdles remain to achieving bipartisan consensus that would allow the pact to move through Congress. Mr. Toomey said he could not support the deal without \u201csignificant\u201d changes in the implementing legislation. The new agreement inhibits free trade, he said, citing new wage requirements on automobile manufacturing as a particular concern.And many Republicans, including Mr. Toomey and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, say they want the White House to remove steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico because Mr. Trump had reached a deal with the two countries.Mr. Trump has so far refused to budge on the metal tariffs and has instead threatened to withdraw from Nafta to try to force Congress to vote on the new trade deal. A formal notice of withdrawal would give Congress six months to pass the pact or potentially return to a pre-Nafta trading system with higher tariffs and more restrictive trade barriers.Republicans are warning that such a move most likely falls outside Mr. Trump\u2019s authority and would only reduce the chances of Congress passing the U.S.M.C.A.\u201cI imagine you\u2019d have a huge sell-off in equities and have very, very disrupted financial markets,\u201d Mr. Toomey said. \u201cI sure hope the president does not go down that road.\u201dRepublican strategists say that unless Mr. Trump agrees to compromise, he will most likely face defeat.\u201cThe president has two options on this trade deal: the honey or the hammer,\u201d said Antonia Ferrier, a Republican strategist with Definers Public Affairs and a former aide to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Mr. Trump, she said, could bargain with Ms. Pelosi or withdraw from Nafta. \u201cNeither are great options,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is why there\u2019s so much skepticism that U.S.M.C.A. will even happen.\u201dDemocrats \u2014 including populists who tend to side more with Mr. Trump than Mr. Toomey on trade issues \u2014 say they are open to working with the administration to improve and pass the agreement. Party leaders have had productive discussions with Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, to reinforce the need for negotiators to secure additional labor and environmental protections before any floor vote.\u201cI\u2019ve talked to Lighthizer. I\u2019ve told him, unless there\u2019s strong enforcement, Nafta\u2019s not going to pass the Senate,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cHe\u2019s aware of that and says there are things they can do.\u201dThe Trump administration spent more than a year negotiating with Canada and Mexico to try to salvage Nafta, a 25-year-old pact that has become critical to the North American economy, particularly the automobile and agriculture sectors. The agreement expanded the flow of goods and capital between the three countries, and prompted multinational corporations to stretch their supply chains up and down the continent.While Mr. Trump had long threatened to rip up Nafta, the business community and many Republican lawmakers pushed to keep it intact, insisting that doing away with the pact would ultimately hurt the United States economy. The new deal, which was agreed to in September, primarily updates Nafta but contains some new provisions, including requiring higher wages at automakers and greater ability to sell dairy products in Canada.Mr. Toomey said he remained deeply concerned that the administration had not rolled back the steel and aluminum tariffs that it had imposed on Canada and Mexico after the trilateral trade agreement was reached last year.He is working on bipartisan legislation that would curtail Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to impose tariffs on the basis of national security \u2014 which the president used to justify the steel and aluminum tariffs \u2014 without congressional approval. The president would almost certainly veto such a measure."}, {"title": "Vanessa Tyson\u2019s Full Statement on Justin Fairfax", "category": "Politics", "id": "0c7cdeca-d359-4f0c-8862-48a85a286a6e", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/us/politics/vanessa-tyson-statement.html", "publishdate": 20190206, "imageurl": "", "content": "Vanessa C. Tyson, who has accused Lt. Gov. Justin E. Fairfax of Virginia of sexually assaulting her at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, released a statement on Wednesday describing her account of their encounter. Mr. Fairfax has denied the allegations. Read the full story here.Here is the complete text of her statement:On the night of Friday, February 1, 2019, I read multiple news accounts indicating that Virginia Lt. Governor Justin Fairfax would likely be elevated to Governor as an immediate result of a scandal involving Governor Ralph Northam. This news flooded me with painful memories, bringing back feelings of grief, shame, and anger that stemmed from an incident with Mr. Fairfax that occurred in July 2004 during the Democratic National Convention in Boston.I met Mr. Fairfax on July 26, 2004, when he and I were working at the Convention. We struck up a conversation on the first day of the Convention and soon realized we had a mutual friend. We crossed paths occasionally during the first two days and our interactions were cordial, but not flirtatious. We commiserated about our long work hours, and on the afternoon of the third day of the Convention, July 28, 2004, Mr. Fairfax suggested that I get some fresh air by accompanying him on a quick errand to retrieve documents from his room in a nearby hotel. Given our interactions up to that time, I had no reason to feel threatened and agreed to walk with him to his hotel. I stood in the entryway of the room and after he located the documents, he walked over and kissed me. Although surprised by his advance, it was not unwelcome and I kissed him back. He then took my hand and pulled me towards the bed. I was fully clothed in a pantsuit and had no intention of taking my clothes off or engaging in sexual activity. In the back of my mind, I also knew I needed to return to Convention headquarters.What began as consensual kissing quickly turned into a sexual assault. Mr. Fairfax put his hand behind my neck and forcefully pushed my head towards his crotch. Only then did I realize that he had unbuckled his belt, unzipped his pants, and taken out his penis. He then forced his penis into my mouth. Utterly shocked and terrified, I tried to move my head away, but could not because his hand was holding down my neck and he was much stronger than me. As I cried and gagged, Mr. Fairfax forced me to perform oral sex on him. I cannot believe, given my obvious distress, that Mr. Fairfax thought this forced sexual act was consensual. To be very clear, I did not want to engage in oral sex with Mr. Fairfax and I never gave any form of consent. Quite the opposite. I consciously avoided Mr. Fairfax for the remainder of the Convention and I never spoke to him again.After the assault, I suffered from both deep humiliation and shame. I did not speak about it for years, and I (like most survivors) suppressed those memories and emotions as a necessary means to continue my studies, and to pursue my goal of building a successful career as an academic. At the time, I found this horrific incident especially degrading given my regular volunteer work at a local rape crisis center. Over the next decade or so, I would go on to earn my PhD from the University of Chicago and become a tenured professor at Scripps College, a prestigious women\u2019s college in Claremont, California.Years later, in October of 2017, I saw a picture of Mr. Fairfax accompanying an article in The Root about his campaign for Lt. Governor in Virginia. The image hit me like a ton of bricks, triggering buried traumatic memories and the feelings of humiliation I\u2019d felt so intensely back in 2004. Prior to reading the article, I had not followed Mr. Fairfax\u2019s career and did not know that he was seeking public office. Unsure of what to do, I felt it was crucial to tell close friends of mine in Virginia, who were voters, about the assault.That October, as the #MeToo movement intensified, women throughout the world began forcefully speaking out about the sexual violence they had experienced and the impact of those experiences on their lives. The courage of so many women coming forward to confront powerful men and systems that allow such abuse to occur are part of what inspired me to action. I felt a responsibility to myself, the beloved students I teach, and the brave women I\u2019ve tried to help overcome their own trauma. The passion and resolve of so many survivors, coupled with the job security that tenure afforded me, gave me the strength I simply did not have in 2004. By December 2017, I not only told many friends that Mr. Fairfax had sexually assaulted me but I also reached out to a personal friend at The Washington Post and spoke to his colleague about the assault.After The Washington Post decided in March 2018 not to run my story, I felt powerless, frustrated, and completely drained. Again I tried to bury memories of this painful incident and focus on my work and my students.On Friday, February 1, 2019, as stories appeared in the media suggesting that Governor Northam would have to resign and that Mr. Fairfax would be sworn in as Governor, I felt a jarring sense of both outrage and despair. That night I vented my frustration on Facebook in a message that I wrote as a private post. I did not identify Lt. Governor Fairfax by name but stated that it seemed inevitable that the campaign staffer who assaulted me during the Democratic Convention in 2004 was about to get a big promotion. It was not my intention in that moment to inject myself into what has become a much larger political battle.The following morning, I was inundated with messages of care and concern from friends \u2014 including many I had told about the sexual assault \u2014 and numerous inquiries from journalists who had become aware of my post. Over the weekend, I was undecided about whether to speak out publicly. I knew that if I did so, I would immediately face accusations about my motives and be branded a liar, as is routinely the case when women come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against prominent men.On Sunday night, before I had time to decide on a course of action, an online publication published a screenshot of my Facebook post, identified me by name, and posted pictures of me. In response, at 2:55 a.m. on February 4, 2019, Mr. Fairfax issued a statement further escalating this matter by calling me a liar and falsely characterizing the reasons The Washington Post decided not to run a story about my allegations. The Post was forced to repudiate Mr. Fairfax\u2019s statement that there were \u201csignificant red flags and inconsistencies within the allegations\u201d which led it to decide not to publish a story about my account. Rather, as is often the case in situations where sexual assault by an acquaintance occurs behind closed doors years earlier, it is difficult to corroborate either the victim\u2019s allegations or the accused\u2019s denials.Mr. Fairfax\u2019s suggestion that The Washington Post found me not to be credible was deceitful, offensive, and profoundly upsetting. He has continued a smear campaign by pointing reporters to a 2007 educational video in which I talked about being the victim of incest and molestation. In that video I did not talk about being assaulted by Mr. Fairfax. This, of course, is not proof that he did not assault me. His reliance on this video to say the opposite is despicable and an offense to sexual assault survivors everywhere.Since October 2017 when I first began telling friends about the assault, I have never wavered in my account because I am telling the truth. I have no political motive. I am a proud Democrat. My only motive in speaking now is to refute Mr. Fairfax\u2019s falsehoods and aspersions of my character, and to provide what I believe is important information for Virginians to have as they make critical decisions that involve Mr. Fairfax.With tremendous anguish, I am now sharing this information about my experience and setting the record straight. It has been extremely difficult to relive that traumatic experience from 2004. Mr. Fairfax has tried to brand me as a liar to a national audience, in service to his political ambitions, and has threatened litigation. Given his false assertions, I\u2019m compelled to make clear what happened. I very much wish to resume my life as an academic and professor. I do not want to get further embroiled in this highly charged political environment.This is the only statement I and my legal team will be making."}, {"title": "When the Tools of the Trade Are the Keyboard and Mouse", "category": "Business", "id": "3cab8fbb-807e-44fc-8010-d37e5368eacd", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/technology/personaltech/when-the-tools-of-the-trade-are-the-keyboard-and-mouse.html", "publishdate": 20190206, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/07/business/07techusing01/merlin_149774187_6a0f6238-716c-4795-bb93-7170c3021915-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Daisuke Wakabayashi, a technology reporter in San Francisco, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.What are your most important tech tools?I\u2019m most particular about the tech products I use as basic tools of my job. I\u2019m a maniac about keyboards and mice; I generally hate most of them. While I use Macs at home and at work, I dislike every Apple keyboard and don\u2019t care for the company\u2019s mice, either. The keys are too flat, I never know if I\u2019ve pressed hard enough, and it hurts my hands after a while.As my colleagues will tell you, I use a very loud mechanical keyboard made by Das Keyboards. These mechanical keyboards are similar to the ones that came with my family\u2019s first IBM computer from the 1980s. I\u2019ve also used the same mouse for the last five years.Aside from that, I use an app called Voice Record Pro on my iPhone for recording interviews. If I\u2019m recording a phone call \u2014 with permission, of course \u2014 I\u2019ll use an app from Rev, which is also the service I use to have my interviews transcribed. It\u2019s a little steep at $1 per minute, but the accuracy is so much better than the A.I.-only alternatives that cost like 10 cents a minute.Why are you so particular about your mouse and keyboard? I feel like I type faster and more accurately with this keyboard \u2014 which is important because I\u2019m already a slow typer. What\u2019s more, the tactile responsiveness when I push a key is so satisfying. It\u2019s silly but it also makes me feel productive, each keystroke an audio reminder that I\u2019m one step closer to my goal.There are drawbacks. The keyboard is not as sleek and visually appealing as the Apple keyboards. They are also super loud, and the click-clacks can be distracting for people around you, as well as unsettling for people you\u2019re on the phone with if you\u2019re taking notes. I\u2019ve often been stopped by sources who ask why I\u2019m typing so feverishly, afraid that I\u2019m pounding the keys because they said something they shouldn\u2019t have. Now, I\u2019ll sometimes take notes by hand using a pen and paper, and then transcribe them later if it\u2019s a sensitive conversation.ImageDaisuke Wakabayashi prefers a mouse with heft and a mechanical keyboard.CreditKatrina Britney Davis for The New York TimesImageHe prefers a mechanical keyboard \u2014 colleagues might describe it as loud \u2014 made by Das Keyboards.CreditKatrina Britney Davis for The New York TimesMy mouse for the last five years has been a wireless one from Microsoft. It\u2019s called the Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse. I like this mouse because it has good heft. Some wireless mice are too light, and they dart around like a hyperactive child. I also don\u2019t want too big of a mouse, and then I feel like arm-wrestling with the device. This one provides a good balance. Also the bottom is plastic, and it\u2019s quiet when I move the mouse around on my desk. The Apple ones make this cringey scraping sound. (Again, I acknowledge that I\u2019m crazy when it comes to my computer accessories.)You cover Google, and in a past life you covered Apple. Both are fierce competitors with their own mobile operating systems, internet services, smartphones and computers. What do you see as the challenges for the companies going forward?Apple has focused on creating beautiful, easy-to-use products, but I find that its products are becoming harder to use. I think some of it is just a function of our devices being asked to do more \u2014 my iPhone is central to my life in ways that it wasn\u2019t even three years ago \u2014 and how do you build in that additional capability without bogging down the software? Apple\u2019s products are still beautiful, but I think that form is overtaking function in some areas. (See: headphone jack, lack of ports on laptops.) A device\u2019s beauty is meaningful only if it is also useful.Google\u2019s issues are different. They\u2019re not purely product questions, but are more fundamental. The company turned 20 last year, and it feels like it\u2019s going through an identity crisis. Google was the anti-Microsoft in the early days. Many of its longtime employees were drawn to Google not purely because it was a moneymaking machine but because it also seemed interested in being a force for good in the tech industry.

ImageHe says that his iPhone is crucial in his life in a way it wasn\u2019t even three years ago.CreditKatrina Britney Davis for The New York TimesBut as Google has grown increasingly dominant, it has become difficult to subscribe to a self-image of a whimsical do-gooder when everyone else sees you as Godzilla trampling across the internet landscape. We\u2019ve already seen some employee revolts, and I suspect we\u2019ll see more. Look at how it is wrestling with what it plans to do with search in China, which shows this identity crisis is filtering into its business and products decisions.Outside of work, what tech product are you and your family currently obsessed with? My wife and I have a 2-year-old son, and he just loves playing with our digital speakers. We have an Amazon Echo in the kitchen and a Google Home upstairs. They\u2019re both connected to Spotify. He knows that he can ask Alexa or Google to play \u201cWheels on the Bus\u201d or \u201cBaa-Baa Black Sheep\u201d and, voil\u00e0, the music comes on.But these days he\u2019s become more particular, and he likes a version of \u201cWheels on the Bus\u201d performed by Mother Goose Club, so he\u2019ll shout something like, \u201cAlexa, play \u2018Wheels on the Bus,\u2019 the goose one, PLEEEEEEEEASE.\u201d (We\u2019ve tried to tell him that Alexa won\u2019t do as he asks unless he says please.) Alexa and Google usually struggle to decipher this request, so Mom and Dad frequently intervene, but occasionally Alexa or Google understands him and he is delighted.His other favorite activity is to ask Google to play sounds of different things. His favorite requests (in no particular order): animals, emergency vehicles and modes of transportation. Recently, he discovered that Google can play the sound of a dinosaur, and this excited him to no end.But now my son thinks anything with an illuminated green ring means it\u2019s a portal for Alexa. Recently, I found him shouting instructions to my wireless iPhone charging pad. It got me thinking, why doesn\u2019t Amazon make an Echo that doubles as a wireless phone charging pad?

It now sees itself as a provider of online audio, period.The company\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Ek, emphasized the shift in direction in a blog post on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished, but what I didn\u2019t know when we launched to consumers in 2008 was that audio \u2014 not just music \u2014 would be the future of Spotify,\u201d he wrote.In announcing its fourth-quarter earnings, the Stockholm company said it had acquired Gimlet Media, the studio behind the popular podcasts \u201cCrimetown,\u201d \u201cReply All\u201d and \u201cStartUp,\u201d and Anchor, which makes tools for recording and distributing podcasts. Financial terms of the transactions were not disclosed.With the acquisitions, Spotify becomes the latest player to invest in a medium once considered a low-stakes sandbox in the larger media environment. Now that podcasts have become part of the listening routine for millions of people, major companies have recognized them as an important \u2014 but still relatively cheap \u2014 source of content.In September, the radio giant iHeartMedia bought Stuff Media, another influential producer, and recently Hollywood has begun buying up rights to popular podcasts. \u201cHomecoming,\u201d an Amazon series starring Julia Roberts, is based on a fictional podcast from Gimlet.\u201cI don\u2019t think Spotify woke up one day and realized that audio storytelling has some incredible emotional place in the life of their brand,\u201d said Owen Grover, the chief executive of Pocket Casts, a podcast app. \u201cStrategically, if they can get their users to listen to podcasts in place of music, it improves their margins.\u201dGimlet\u2019s shows will expand Spotify\u2019s podcasting slate, which includes thousands of shows widely available on other platforms, as well as high-profile exclusive productions from the comedian Amy Schumer, the journalist Jemele Hill, the rapper Joe Budden and others.\u201cWe are still at the dawn of the second golden age of audio, and we know Spotify is a perfect partner and platform to take Gimlet \u2014 and podcasting at large \u2014 to a new level,\u201d Alex Blumberg and Matthew Lieber, the public radio veterans who founded Gimlet in 2014, said in a statement.Podcasts also offer a financial advantage, helping Spotify improve profit margin and reduce its dependence on the major record companies, whose licensing deals are by far its largest expense.While podcasts are hardly a new invention \u2014 they became part of Apple\u2019s iTunes in 2005 \u2014 their popularity has surged in recent years. By some estimates, more than 600,000 podcasts are available through Apple, a number that does not include shows that are exclusive to other providers, like Spotify.But while it may seem as if every other person on earth is either a podcast listener or a podcast host, the money thrown off by the boomlet has been relatively modest. According to a study by the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PwC, the podcast industry as a whole generated $314 million in 2017, though that survey also predicts that by 2020 the number will more than double, to $659 million.Spotify, which went public in April, announced on Wednesday that it ended 2018 with 207 million active users around the world, 96 million of whom paid for monthly subscriptions. Its revenue for the year was 5.3 billion euros, about $6 billion, an increase of 29 percent from 2017.And while in 2018 the company lost \u20ac78 million, about $89 million, it had a net income of \u20ac442 million, or about $502 million, in its fourth quarter. Spotify\u2019s gross profit margin also grew in that quarter, to 26.7 percent, from 25.3 percent in the previous three months.Despite Spotify\u2019s dominance among music listeners (its chief rival, Apple Music, has 50 million paying subscribers), Mr. Ek, the company\u2019s chief executive, predicted that \u201cover time,\u201d about 20 percent of all Spotify listening would involve something other than music.\u201cUltimately, if we are successful, we will begin competing more broadly for time against all forms of entertainment and informational services, and not just music streaming services,\u201d Mr. Ek wrote in his blog post.For the music industry, which has become increasingly reliant on streaming revenue \u2014 yet has regularly tussled with Spotify over money \u2014 that may be seen as a signal that Spotify sees podcasts as a cheaper way to satisfy its customers. Barry McCarthy, Spotify\u2019s chief financial officer, has frequently pointed to podcasts as a way to increase the company\u2019s margins.\u201cEven though music rights holders think Spotify is underpaying for their music, Spotify has struggled thus far to make the economics work,\u201d Mark Mulligan, a digital media analyst at Midia Research, said. \u201cBut Spotify cannot wait to play the long game, so it sees podcasts as a nearer-term way of populating its service with higher-margin content.\u201dFor some observers, the Spotify deal also suggests an end to the Wild West era of podcasting, in which Apple played the role of disinterested host to numerous shows from all kinds of independent producers.\u201cThis is the end of the open era,\u201d said Nick Quah, the writer of HotPod, a popular newsletter about podcasts. \u201cApple never picked winners and losers. A guy or a lady in the grandma\u2019s basement had the same position as \u2018This American Life,\u2019 and they battled it out for listeners.\u201d\u201cIn the new balance of power,\u201d he added, \u201cwinners and losers might not be made in the same way.\u201d"}, {"title": "Video Game Stocks Get Clobbered, and Fortnite Is to Blame", "category": "Business", "id": "d679d8a9-216f-4d84-b86f-0e99c446036e", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/business/dealbook/electronic-arts-take-two-fortnite-earnings.html", "publishdate": 20190206, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/07/business/dealbook/07DB-GAMEMAKERS1/07DB-GAMEMAKERS1-articleLarge.png", "content": "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________Shares of video game makers slid on Wednesday after Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive Software delivered disappointing results.

After losing money for years, Twitter has now posted five straight quarters of profits, even though its revenue growth has slowed.The financial performance was marred by a drop in Twitter users for a third consecutive quarter. The company said it had 321 million users in the fourth quarter, down from 326 million in the previous quarter.Still, Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, said the results indicated that his company was finding its financial footing \u2014 especially since it was the first full year that Twitter had turned a profit.In a statement, he said \u201c2018 is proof that our long-term strategy is working.\u201dTwitter, President Trump\u2019s favorite social media service, has been grappling with challenges for some time, such as harassment and bullying on its platform. More recently, it has also had to deal with disinformation, foreign interference and accusations of political bias. Mr. Dorsey denied that Twitter was biased when he testified before Congress late last year.On Thursday, Mr. Dorsey said he was \u201cfocused on making Twitter a healthier and more conversational service.\u201d Twitter has increasingly relied on artificial intelligence to detect abuse, allowing it to remove offending messages more quickly. It has also improved account security, making it more difficult for spammers to open accounts.Much of Twitter\u2019s growth in the fourth quarter occurred in Japan, which accounted for 15 percent of the company\u2019s total revenue. The United States remained Twitter\u2019s biggest market, bringing in 56 percent of revenue.Twitter has said its decline in users is related to its efforts to stamp out fake accounts. The company said that the number of reports from individuals who had an abusive interaction on Twitter during 2018 had declined by 16 percent, and that its rules had been updated to make clear what kind of conduct the company considered unacceptable.The decrease in users has prompted concerns about whether Twitter really has room to grow. As a point of contrast, Facebook and its apps, which include Instagram and WhatsApp, continue to gain users. Facebook said last week that 2.7 billion people now used its core social network and its other apps.Twitter\u2019s stock fell nearly 10 percent on Thursday after it also issued conservative revenue guidance for the current quarter and said its expenses would continue to rise, said Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG. Twitter said that it expected revenue of $715 million to $775 million in the current quarter and that its expenses would increase 20 percent this year.\u201cMaybe this is as good as it gets,\u201d Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said of Twitter."}, {"title": "National Australia Bank Chiefs to Resign in Wake of Damaging Report", "category": "Business", "id": "df02b607-53c0-4389-93d7-1e742380176f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/business/national-australia-bank-resign.html", "publishdate": 20190207, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/08/world/08oz-banks1-print/merlin_148300065_55159ecc-eeee-4856-821b-1e9ed3aed0eb-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 The two top executives at one of Australia\u2019s largest banks will depart after a damning report on misconduct in the country\u2019s financial industry singled them out for their resistance to changing how they do business.National Australia Bank said on Thursday that Andrew Thorburn, its chief executive, and Ken Henry, its chairman, would soon resign from the company. The bank cited the report issued on Monday by an Australian royal commission that castigated the industry for putting profit ahead of its customers and called for tougher regulations and accountability.The report recounted moments during months of public hearings and submissions in which Mr. Thorburn dismissed systems failures that might have cost his customers over 100 million Australian dollars, or $71 million, as \u201ccarelessness.\u201d\u201cHaving heard from both the C.E.O., Mr. Thorburn, and the chair, Dr. Henry, I am not as confident as I would wish to be that the lessons of the past have been learned,\u201d Kenneth Hayne, who led the commission that investigated questionable financial industries practices, wrote in the Monday report.\u201cMore particularly, I was not persuaded that N.A.B. is willing to accept the necessary responsibility for deciding, for itself, what is the right thing to do, and then having its staff act accordingly,\u201d he said, referring to National Australia Bank.Dr. Henry, he said, \u201cseemed unwilling to accept any criticism of how the board had dealt with some issues.\u201dThe report issued Monday was not as far-reaching as some critics had hoped. It will largely leave in place the grip that four big banks, including National Australia Bank, have on the country\u2019s banking system. That concentration of power has led to higher costs for consumers, according to a recent Australian government report.Even if the Australian government follows through on its pledge to \u201cact on\u201d Mr. Hayne\u2019s recommendations, it has little time to do so. The government must hand down a federal budget in early April, then faces major elections in May.ImageNational Australia Bank\u2019s chairman, Ken Henry.CreditDan Himbrechts/EPA, via ShutterstockStill, the departures could help National Australia Bank fix its practices and restore its reputation, said Richard Holden, an economics professor at the University of New South Wales.\u201cIt gives the bank a reset and a fresh start,\u201d said Mr. Holden, though he noted that after Mr. Hayne\u2019s report, \u201cthey had no real option.\u201dWhether the removal of the two executives results in an effective new start depends on who replaces them, he said, citing a need for \u201cstrong and serious\u201d leaders.In its statement, National Australia Bank and the two departing executives acknowledged the role the report had played in their resignations.\u201cI acknowledge that the bank has sustained damage as a result of its past practices and comments in the royal commission\u2019s final report about them,\u201d Mr. Thorburn said in the statement from the bank. \u201cAs C.E.O., I understand accountability. I have always sought to act in the best interests of the bank and customers, and I know that I have always acted with integrity. However, I recognize there is a desire for change.\u201dMr. Thorburn will leave at the end of the month, the bank said, while Dr. Henry will retire once a permanent successor has been named.\u201cI am enormously proud of what the bank has achieved and equally disappointed about what the royal commission has brought to light in areas where we have not met customer expectations,\u201d Dr. Henry said in the company statement.National Australia Bank in particular could face pressure to prove it can change its ways. In his report, Mr. Hayne wrote that the bank \u201cstands apart\u201d in its reaction to allegations of damaging industry practices.\u201cOver all,\u201d Mr. Hayne added, \u201cmy fear \u2014 that there may be a wide gap between the public face N.A.B. seeks to show and what it does in practice \u2014 remains.\u201d"}, {"title": "The Financial Crisis Put a Chill on Big Bank Deals.

The banks would most likely shed deposits and branches in some cities to pass muster with federal regulators.In general, bank mergers tend to benefit shareholders and executives but translate into lost jobs and reduced competition, which hurts customers through higher prices and worse terms for banking products and services. BB&T and SunTrust executives insist that would not happen in this case because, while they plan to eliminate lots of jobs, they would plow the savings into technological innovations that fostered greater competition with the nation\u2019s largest banks.Analysts and investors have long said the United States banking industry is ripe for consolidation. But the anticipated wave of mergers never took place, in part because many executives feared that getting much bigger would subject them to tougher financial regulations and extra government scrutiny.Now, though, the Trump administration and its appointees at the Federal Reserve Board have eased regulations and signaled a more relaxed approach with the country\u2019s biggest banks.The industry will be closely watching how regulators react to the BB&T-SunTrust deal. If it succeeds, it could usher in an era of deal-making. If it is blocked, the decade-long drought will continue.\u201cThis will be a meaningful gauge of regulatory comfort with bank mergers,\u201d said Isaac Boltansky, policy research director for Compass Point, an investment bank. For the biggest banks, he said, \u201cmy sense is that there is still a regulatory hesitancy.\u201dThe combination of BB&T and SunTrust would create a new bank, as yet unnamed, with more than $400 billion in assets. The new bank would be based in Charlotte, which is already home to Bank of America\u2019s headquarters and much of Wells Fargo\u2019s business.The combined bank\u2019s assets would be well over the $250 billion threshold that, under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, mandates that lenders adhere to stricter capital requirements and closer regulatory scrutiny.A 2018 law raised the threshold from $50 billion, which led to widespread predictions of a wave of regional bank mergers. (The country\u2019s biggest lenders, such as JPMorgan, would still face prohibitively high hurdles to striking big acquisitions, though big regional lenders like U.S. Bank and PNC Financial might be able to buy smaller assets.)The new regulations helped give BB&T and SunTrust certainty about the regulatory environment.\u201cYou might expect that we wouldn\u2019t announce something like this without feeling confident\u201d about the response from Washington, Kelly King, BB&T\u2019s chairman and chief executive, told analysts on Thursday.The plan is already attracting attention from opponents of megabanks. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, sent a letter to the Federal Reserve on Thursday expressing concerns about the deal.She said data that the Fed had provided her office last year showed that the central bank rarely objected to proposed deals. It approved 89 percent of bank merger applications from 2014 through 2017, and 94 percent of applications during the first half of 2018. All were far smaller than the one proposed by BB&T and SunTrust.A spokesman for the Fed said officials had received Ms. Warren\u2019s letter and were planning to respond.The Democrat with the most power over the banking industry, Representative Maxine Waters of California, called the merger part of a \u201cderegulatory giveaway\u201d by Republicans.Under the terms of the proposed transaction, BB&T would pay 1.295 of its shares, an amount worth about $62.85 at the end of trading on Wednesday, for each SunTrust share \u2014 a 7 percent premium over SunTrust\u2019s Wednesday closing price.BB&T would own 57 percent of the combined entity. While its headquarters would be in Charlotte, the new bank would maintain operations in Winston-Salem and Atlanta.Mr. King of BB&T would become executive chairman of the merged bank, while William Rogers, his SunTrust counterpart, would be chief executive and take over the chairman role in 2022.\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinarily attractive financial proposition that provides the scale needed to compete and win in the rapidly evolving world of financial services,\u201d Mr. King said in a statement. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, pending regulatory and shareholder approval.Investors in both firms appeared pleased by the transaction. Shares of BB&T were up 4 percent on Thursday, to $50.46, while those of SunTrust were up 10 percent, to $64.72.The two banks said they expected to cut $1.6 billion in costs by eliminating jobs in bank branches and in so-called back office positions, such as in accounting and legal departments. They said those savings would help finance a technology center in Charlotte focused on building digital banking systems, which in theory would help the new bank compete with the national giants.\u201cThe innovation center is not just lip service,\u201d said Andrew Atherton, a director at the technology-focused investment bank Union Square Advisors. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got more dollars to deploy to tech as a larger entity, you can start to compete more directly with the JPMorgans, the U.S. Banks, the Wells Fargos, who are leaders in the technology.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: The Biggest Bank Merger Since the Financial Crisis", "category": "Business", "id": "0495e688-1fb9-4ea6-ad31-718c2c5b516e", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/business/dealbook/bbt-suntrust-merger.html", "publishdate": 20190207, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/08/business/08db-newsletter-bbt1/merlin_58095628_f85458f1-5522-4695-9f53-84878279cc31-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Thursday.

I think the bank is well positioned to be a positive contributor to that.\u201dNot everyone will be convinced. \u201cDavid Malpass will have a lot of work to do to convince other shareholders that he is prepared to move beyond his past statements and track record when it comes to the World Bank\u2019s agenda,\u201d Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, told the FT. \u201cThe rest of the world holds 84 percent of the voting power at the World Bank.

Instacart\u2019s C.E.O., Apoorva Mehta, said that he had now reversed the policy: \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to change course quickly when we realize we\u2019re on the wrong path and we believe today\u2019s changes are a step in the right direction.\u201dWhy it matters: Gig economy workers are largely contract workers, exempting them from many labor protections. But Kevin Roose of the NYT writes that Instacart\u2019s about-face shows that they can still find ways to put pressure on their companies: \u201cBy organizing en masse and expressing vocal opposition to exploitative policies, they have managed to wring some concessions out of the billion-dollar corporations whose labor they provide.\u201dBut the problem may run deeper: Shirin Ghaffary of Recode writes that \u201cmany workers in the new on-demand app economy are not being paid a consistent living wage.\u201dImageHoward SchultzCreditTed S.

Howard Schultz\u2019s potential presidential run, financed by his Starbucks billions, has been criticized by Democrats. Lawmakers are campaigning for higher taxes on the wealthy.At this moment, Farhad Manjoo asks in his latest NYT opinion column whether billionaires should even exist:\u2022 \u201cBanishing billionaires \u2014 seeking to cut their economic power, working to reduce their political power and attempting to question their social status \u2014 is a pithy, perfectly encapsulated vision for surviving the digital future.\u201d\u2022 \u201cIt could mean preventing people from keeping more than a billion in booty, but more likely it would mean higher marginal taxes on income, wealth and estates for billionaires and people on the way to becoming billionaires.\u201d\u2022 \u201cArtificial intelligence is creating prosperous new industries that don\u2019t employ very many workers; left unchecked, technology is creating a world where a few billionaires control an unprecedented share of global wealth.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Manjoo concedes that some billionaires use their wealth for good. The moral philosopher Peter Singer has pointed to Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have pledged to give away the bulk of their money to charity.\u2022 But Mr. Manjoo concludes, \u201cIf we tolerate the supposedly \u2018good\u2019 billionaires in politics, we inevitably leave open the door for the bad ones.

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.[Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]Virginia men are giving Florida Man a run for his money this week.First, Gov. Ralph Northam said he once wore blackface to dress as Michael Jackson for a dance contest, after admitting \u2014 and then denying \u2014 he posed for a racist photo in his medical school yearbook.A few days later, Lt. Gov. Justin E. Fairfax, who would take over as governor if Mr. Northam resigned, was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2004. He\u2019s denied the charge, and has hired the law firm that represented Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing.And on Wednesday, Attorney General Mark R. Herring, third in the line of succession and an expected candidate for governor in 2021, admitted that he, too, wore blackface at a college party in the 1980s. After a tearful meeting with black lawmakers yesterday, he suggested he could resign.If the three men, all Democrats, were to step down, next in line for the governorship would be a Republican \u2014 Kirk Cox, speaker of the House of Delegates, who got the job because a Republican\u2019s name was picked from this ceramic bowl in a tiebreaker. (Seriously.)The controveries are a disaster for Democrats, and for Virginia, a state that has struggled with its legacy as the birthplace of American slavery.But they may also foreshadow how some of the country\u2019s raw and polarized dynamics around gender and race could play out in the 2020 election:\u2022 For Democrats, it\u2019s the party\u2019s first high-stakes test of their new, zero-tolerance politics when it comes to racism and sexism \u2014 a brand the party has embraced in response to President Trump\u2019s demagogy on race and misogynistic attacks.\u2022 For Republicans, it illustrates how they can weaponize those politics against their opposition.Republicans, it should be noted, haven\u2019t escaped this crisis completely: It was revealed today that Thomas K. Norment Jr., the Republican majority leader in the Virginia Senate, helped oversee a yearbook that featured racist photographs and slurs. But unlike the Democrats, Mr. Norment is not high enough in the line of succession to change the balance of power in the state.While national Democrats greeted Mr. Northam\u2019s admission with quick and near-universal condemnation, they\u2019ve been notably more reserved when it comes to Mr. Fairfax or Mr. Herring resigning.By the standards set by their own party over the past few years, all three men could easily be pushed out of office.But Virginia Democrats face no easy choices. If the men all step down, they hand the leadership of a key battleground state to Republicans. If the men stay in office, they enter the 2019 elections severely hampered in their ability to mobilize the coalition of women and black voters they need to win in the state.Oh, and right now, Republicans have a single-seat majority in the Virginia House of Delegates, and the entire Legislature is up for election this fall \u2014 meaning the balance of the body is at stake.So how do Democrats get out of this? Some suggest Mr. Herring, who offered a seemingly heartfelt apology, could survive.\u201cHe reached out to each of us individually, very apologetic,\u201d United States Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia told our colleague Catie Edmondson today. \u201cHe is in dialogue with the legislative black caucus and African-American leadership in the state, and they have been impressed with his sincerity, while they\u2019ve been very disappointed with what happened.\u201dHowever it\u2019s resolved, it\u2019s clear that Republicans see a way to use the new politics of the Democratic Party against them. Don\u2019t forget, this situation started because Mr. Northam made comments supporting a state bill that would roll back restrictions on late-term abortions. His remarks prompted a \u201cconcerned citizen\u201d to point a right-wing website toward the blackface photo in his medical school yearbook.Mr. Trump seized on Mr. Northam\u2019s remarks in his State of the Union address, using them to call for legislation banning late-term abortions. This morning, he tweeted an even more direct attack.Republicans are already riding high off another racial controversy that they believe played into their hands: A viral video first seemed to show a group of Catholic boys in MAGA hats in a standoff with a Native American veteran, but the narrative grew complicated as more videos emerged, eventually earning the boys an invitation to the White House.The boys, it\u2019s worth noting, were in Washington for the March for Life, an annual anti-abortion rally.[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.]____________________Drop us a line!ImageWe want to hear from our readers.

Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com.____________________Sixty-Second Guide to \u2026 the Green New DealImageWe were curious to know more about the Green New Deal. So we turned to Lisa Friedman, who covers climate and environmental policy in Washington for The Times. Here\u2019s what she told us:You might have heard talk of a Green New Deal, a proposal backed by the rising liberal star Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and thousands of young activists with the lofty ambitions of not only fighting climate change, but also racial, social and economic injustice.If you weren\u2019t clear on exactly what the Green New Deal aimed to do, though, you weren\u2019t alone. Even the Democratic presidential candidates who embraced it were vague.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work through the details,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told me last week, when I asked whether she supported some of the specifics that had been floating around. Senator Kamala Harris of California said there were \u201cmany versions\u201d of the proposal, \u201call worthy of consideration.\u201dBut now lawmakers have finally put some flesh on the bones of the Green New Deal, introducing a sweeping resolution today that seeks to define the policy. Here are a few key highlights:\u2022 The Green New Deal calls for the United States to reach \u201cnet zero\u201d emissions within 10 years. That would include shifting America\u2019s power grid to \u201cclean, renewable and zero-emissions energy sources,\u201d increasing the energy efficiency of buildings and creating electric vehicle infrastructure to eliminate planet-warming emissions from transportation.\u2022 It also calls for a host of social-justice efforts not normally associated with saving the planet. For example, the measure would guarantee \u201ca job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations and retirement security to all people of the United States.\u201d It also guarantees \u201chigh quality education,\u201d health care and adequate housing.\u2022 The resolution includes no details on how to pay for the sweeping societal changes, though a fact sheet provided by congressional staff makes the case that it will pay for itself. \u201cThe Green New Deal is a massive investment program, not an expenditure,\u201d proponents of the measure wrote. \u201cWe will finance the investments for the Green New Deal the same way we paid for the original New Deal, World War II, the bank bailouts, tax cuts for the rich, and decades of war \u2014 with public money appropriated by Congress.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear whether the measure will even get to the House floor, where Democrats hold a majority, and it\u2019s likely dead on arrival in the Republican-held Senate. Yet as a messaging and policy tool for Democrats going into the 2020 presidential race, the Green New Deal promises to be a big deal.Read Lisa\u2019s story: Democrats Formally Call for a Green New Deal, Giving Substance to a Rallying CryWe want to hear your thoughts on the Green New Deal.

The disclosure nonetheless threatened to increase the legal jeopardy swirling around Mr. Ghosn, who is in a Tokyo jail on charges that he underreported his income as Nissan chairman. Renault had previously said that an internal review raised no questions of wrongdoing on his part.The funds at issue are connected to a \u20ac2.3 million donation Renault made to Versailles under a 2016 sponsorship deal. Versailles officials said in a statement Thursday that the sponsorship was meant to finance renovations at the extravagant estate, which was once home to French kings and is now among the country\u2019s top tourist attractions.In exchange, the carmaker was entitled to use the property for an equivalent rental value of up to 25 percent of the contribution. Any Versailles properties Renault used under the deal were to be solely for company activities like team building, not for personal events, according a person with knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The donation came from a budget controlled by the office of Mr. Ghosn in his role as Renault\u2019s chairman and chief executive, the person said.The Versailles statement said Renault had asked to rent space in the Grand Trianon, a mansion on the palace grounds, and an adjacent gallery for a dinner, on Oct. 8, 2016 \u2014 the day of Mr. Ghosn\u2019s party. The rental was valued at \u20ac50,000, the statement said.Jean-Yves Le Borgne, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s French lawyer, said: \u201cCarlos Ghosn paid for all of his wedding expenses. The event space at Versailles was made available to him without charge, and Mr. Ghosn was unaware that the use of the space would be charged against Renault\u2019s allotted usage.\u201dIn a subsequent statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ghosn said he would reimburse Versailles.The French news outlet Le Figaro reported Thursday that an invoice from an event company that organized the party listed the rental as being \u201coffered by Versailles,\u201d an indication that it had been a personal gift to Mr. Ghosn.Even with no money changing hands, staging a personal party at Versailles under the sponsorship deal could be considered an abuse of corporate assets, a criminal offense in France that carries penalties of up to five years in prison and a fine of \u20ac375,000, or about $425,000.The black-tie event with 120 guests included actresses in period clothing and powdered wigs welcoming Mr. Ghosn and his second wife, Carole. The reception hall was tended by white-suited waiters and featured tiered golden dishes filled with macarons, and a towering, pyramid-shaped wedding cake made of choux pastry.\u201cWhen you invite people to a party, they say maybe,\u201d Mr. Ghosn told Town & Country magazine, which splashed paparazzi photos of the event across its pages. \u201cWhen you invite them to Versailles, they will come.\u201dPhotos of the party have surfaced recently on social media, circulating widely as symbols of excess amid the so-called Yellow Vest protests against income inequality.Renault began to examine Mr. Ghosn\u2019s financial activities in France after he was arrested on his private jet at Tokyo\u2019s international airport in November. He has been in jail there since.Renault and Nissan have also been conducting a joint inquiry into a Dutch corporate entity that Mr. Ghosn led, Renault-Nissan BV, which the Japanese authorities have said he used to finance extra benefits for himself, including acquiring several homes with Nissan money.The inquiry, which is being led by Mazars, an auditing firm based in Paris, is expected to encompass executive compensation, payments to consultants and general expenses, according to two people familiar with the situation.For weeks, Renault stood by Mr. Ghosn. As it became apparent he could not be released on bail before a trial in Japan, he resigned, paving the way for the French automaker to appoint a new chairman and chief executive.Mr. Ghosn insists that he is innocent of all charges. He said in recent interviews with Japanese and French newspapers that he was the victim of \u201cplot and treason\u201d by other Nissan leaders who wanted to thwart his plans to bring the alliance partners together under a single holding company."}, {"title": "Germany Restricts Facebook\u2019s Data Gathering", "category": "Business", "id": "9625eada-ff31-430b-8046-83236174900d", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/technology/germany-facebook-data.html", "publishdate": 20190207, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/08/business/08facebook1/merlin_136656096_b3627752-3af5-458a-902f-f3a848585501-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "In a direct challenge to Facebook\u2019s business model, Germany\u2019s competition authority on Thursday sharply curtailed how the tech giant may profile people, saying that users could refuse to allow the company to combine their Facebook information with data about their activities on other sites.The agency, in a novel antitrust argument, said that the company had exploited its dominant position in the German market by coercing people into giving up their personal data. The social network\u2019s terms of service, regulators said, had unfairly forced people to make an all-or-nothing choice \u2014 between submitting to unlimited data collection by the company or not using Facebook at all.The practice has enabled the Silicon Valley company to collect data about its users\u2019 activities on millions of non-Facebook sites, personal details that helped make the social network a worldwide powerhouse of personalized advertising.But German regulators ruled that Facebook would now have to stop automatically collecting and combining that data and instead give German users a choice. They also prohibited the company from merging information from Facebook accounts with data from the users\u2019 accounts on other Facebook-owned services, like Instagram and WhatsApp, without permission.\u201cFacebook will no longer be allowed to force its users to agree to the practically unrestricted collection and assigning of non-Facebook data to their Facebook user accounts,\u201d Andreas Mundt, president of the Federal Cartel Office, the German competition authority, said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cThe combination of data sources substantially contributed to the fact that Facebook was able to build a unique database for each individual user and thus to gain market power.\u201dThe German ruling comes at a critical moment for Facebook. The company is under intense scrutiny by officials in the European Union and the United States after a series of scandals last year raised questions about how it collects and handles personal information. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook\u2019s data-sharing practices violated a 2011 consent agreement prohibiting it from deceiving users on privacy. A decision on that case is expected soon.Although the German decision affects only about 32 million of Facebook\u2019s more than two billion active monthly users, it could have far-reaching implications.Authorities in Germany and some other European countries contend that Facebook has unfairly used its leverage to freely collect details about users on millions of third-party sites that use tools like Facebook\u2019s \u201clike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d buttons and its analytics service, called Facebook Pixel. In doing so, the German agency\u2019s ruling is advancing a larger antitrust argument: that a tech company\u2019s abuse of its market dominance to amass information about and profile its users can amount to a kind of data coercion.\u201cThe Facebook decision is quite a fundamental decision,\u201d Mr. Mundt said in a phone interview. \u201cIf we have similar companies creating similar problems, of course, one could take a look at those as well.\u201dFacebook disagreed with the ruling, saying in a statement that the social network was merely popular in Germany, not dominant, and was being unfairly targeted. It also said its ability to use data from beyond its main Facebook site helped both improve services and protect its users\u2019 information.Facebook added that German regulators had unfairly singled out the company for business practices that are common in the industry.\u201cAll of this should be \u2014 and is \u2014 a legitimate area of focus for regulators and policymakers around the world,\u201d the company said in a statement. Yet German regulators, the company said, are trying \u201cto implement an unconventional standard for a single company.\u201dFacebook said it planned to appeal the decision, a move that must be made in the next month. The ruling does not impose fines on Facebook because the German agency conducted the case as an administrative proceeding, an approach intended to compel companies to change their practices rather than punish them.More on Facebook\u2019s Privacy IssuesThe company has been facing rising scrutiny worldwide.European Regulators Ask if Facebook Is Taking Too Much DataApril 24, 2018Why the F.T.C. Is Taking a New Look at Facebook Privacy Dec. 22, 2018Facebook Rebuked for Failing to Disclose Data-Sharing DealsDec. 19, 2018Facebook Sued by District of Columbia Over Cambridge AnalyticaDec. 19, 2018The German competition authority has been quite active in investigating market competition in the tech sector. Mr. Mundt compared the Facebook ruling to a 2013 case in which his agency charged Amazon with unfairly prohibiting sellers, as a condition of selling their products on the site, from offering lower prices elsewhere. Amazon ultimately agreed to abandon its pricing practice.The agency is now investigating Amazon\u2019s terms and practices toward third-party sellers in Germany on its site. And for the last year, the regulator has also been conducting an investigation into the online advertising industry, with a particular focus on whether a few large companies are hindering market competition.Over the last few years, Europe has emerged as the world\u2019s leading watchdog of the technology industry, punishing Amazon, Apple, Google and Qualcomm for tax evasion and anticompetitive behavior. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust chief who has clashed with Silicon Valley, argues that regulators must be more wary of a company\u2019s accumulation of data to accumulate power and stifle competition.Image\u201cFacebook will no longer be allowed to force its users to agree to the practically unrestricted collection and assigning of non-Facebook data to their Facebook user accounts,\u201d Andreas Mundt, president of the Federal Cartel Office, the German competition authority, said on Thursday.CreditRolf Vennenbernd/DPA, via Associated PressEuropean regulators have also been empowered by a tough new E.U. law, called the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., governing how companies and institutions handle people\u2019s personal information. The law allows regulators to fine companies up to 4 percent of their global revenue, or about $2.1 billion in the case of Facebook. Regulators in Ireland and Britain are among those now investigating Facebook\u2019s data-handling practices under the new law.Among other rules, the new European law generally requires companies to obtain a person\u2019s freely given consent before collecting and using their personal information.German regulators made their ruling under the country\u2019s competition law. But Mr. Mundt said Facebook had also violated the E.U. data protection law by essentially forcing users to agree that the company could freely amass their data \u2014 a process he referred to as \u201cinvoluntary\u201d consent. He added that, while many people understood that Facebook collected data about their activities on the social network, they did not understand that Facebook could collect data about them from millions of non-Facebook sites.The ruling prohibits Facebook\u2019s all-or-nothing approach to amassing personal information about its users. It allows Facebook to continue collecting data about people on its own platforms. But it will need permission before collecting data about its users from non-Facebook sites and combining it with their Facebook account data. It will also need permission to combine Facebook user account data with user data on company-owned services like WhatsApp and Instagram.\u201cWe are giving choice back to the consumer,\u201d Mr. Mundt said, adding that \u201cwe make sure that Facebook is not gathering data in an amount that might hinder competitors.\u201dIn its statement, Facebook said that the company complied with and supported the E.U. data protection law. It also said that the antitrust agency was overstepping its jurisdiction and wading into issues that should be regulated by Europe\u2019s data protection agencies.The decision \u201cunderestimates the fierce competition we face in Germany, misinterprets our compliance with G.D.P.R. and undermines the mechanisms European law provides for ensuring consistent data protection standards across the E.U.,\u201d the Facebook statement said.The German ruling could lead to wider regulatory action against Facebook. Giovanni Buttarelli, the European data protection supervisor who oversees an independent European Union authority that advises on privacy-related laws and policies, said that data protection regulators from across Europe planned to discuss the case over the next few weeks.His office, he said, has \u201cconsistently supported competition authorities taking action to combat abuse of dominance in a market by means of exploitation of consumers. We are therefore encouraged by this decision.\u201dAmie Tsang and Adam Satariano contributed reporting."}, {"title": "How Facebook\u2019s Tiny China Sales Floor Helps Generate Big Ad Money", "category": "Business", "id": "bbb4d6f5-4048-4c1b-a245-bdf41ace4c02", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/technology/facebook-china-internet.html", "publishdate": 20190207, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/07/business/07facebookchina-1/merlin_150057699_9167a238-90d9-498a-9213-0855e9a63e59-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SHENZHEN \u2014 Facebook\u2019s apps and websites have been blocked in China for years.

It functions as an experience center for the Silicon Valley giant \u2014 the only one of its type in the world.Its smallish size belies a crucial, and often overlooked, part of Facebook\u2019s business. The center \u2014 which looks as if it fell out of Silicon Valley, with stenciled paintings of chat boxes on the walls, a lit-up heart icon and a pristine billiards table \u2014 hosts prospective clients and curious customers who wish to advertise on Facebook to reach the network\u2019s 2.3 billion users, most of whom live outside China.The desire by Chinese companies and other entities to get in front of people internationally has unexpectedly turned China into one of Facebook\u2019s largest sources of advertising revenue, even though the social network itself is not available in the country. Charles Shen, chief executive of Meet Social, said his company anticipated doing $1 billion to $2 billion in ad sales on Facebook and Instagram this year. Each day, he added, Meet Social\u2019s software puts up about 20,000 Chinese ads on Facebook.In total, Facebook\u2019s revenue from Chinese-based advertisers reached an estimated $5 billion in 2018, or about 10 percent of its total sales, according to Pivotal Research Group. That would be enough to rank Facebook somewhere around the seventh-largest listed internet company in China.The experience center is also a strange testament to the borders that China has drawn across the internet. With its \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d of internet filters that Beijing used to block Facebook in 2009, the Chinese government has cut the digital abstractions of a global information network along geographic lines. That has necessitated Facebook\u2019s creation of the center, where Chinese who have hardly any experience with the social network can learn about it and figure out how to advertise on it.ImageA portrait of China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, sits nearby Facebook\u2019s experience center. The center is part of a government-run technology exhibition.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York Times\u201cThe experience center is for inviting potential clients to see how Facebook ads work,\u201d Mr. Shen said in an interview, adding that Facebook provided much of the materials in the office, while his company staffed it.Meet Social, an advertising agency, worked with Facebook to open the center last spring. While many Chinese have not used Facebook, that does not prevent them from knowing about it, Mr. Shen said. He said his company got plenty of inbound interest from clients, even though it does little advertising about itself.\u201cMost of the time, it\u2019s them who come to us,\u201d Mr. Shen said. He said his firm had set up a system so that Chinese clients didn\u2019t have to leap the Great Firewall to register an advertising account on Facebook. To do so, it uses a service provided by a state-run telecom company to legally jump the internet filters.Meet Social\u2019s clients include start-ups, gaming companies and big brands like China Southern Airlines, Mr. Shen added. His firm also runs the Facebook pages of some large Chinese brands, helping to increase engagement and to make ads that international audiences understand.The choice of venue for the experience center appears deliberate. It is part of a government-run technology exhibition, where several major tech firms show off accomplishments. Just next door, the man standing in the way of Facebook\u2019s entry into China \u2014 China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping \u2014 is given full homage. A portrait of Mr. Xi sits next to a video celebrating China\u2019s technological achievements, including its development of nuclear weapons, as part of a display by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.The Chinese authorities appear to have made no effort to shut down the experience center. The local government did not respond to a request for comment.Facebook employees come to the center to give talks, Mr. Shen said. Since many Chinese cannot access facebook.com \u2014 even if they type it into their phones while in the experience center, the site remains blocked \u2014 Meet Social provides videos on giant phone-shaped screens so people can get a better sense of Facebook\u2019s ad offerings. Examples of paid posts from Chinese brands are framed on the walls. Training in marketing and advertising strategies on Facebook\u2019s platforms is also offered.Jeffery Hong, a sales director at a wig company, which he declined to name, said he first thought of advertising on Facebook when he went to a salon run by Meet Social in Shenzhen in 2015.ImageVisitors to the experience center can learn about Facebook\u2019s ad offerings and get trained in marketing and ad strategies.CreditLam Yik Fei for The New York TimesMr. Hong previously had mostly done overseas sales through Alibaba, China\u2019s biggest e-commerce site. In the years that followed, he attended training sessions and talks by Facebook employees, including at the experience center, on an array of subjects including how to offer a good user experience and how to make ads.Now Facebook ads attract buyers to his company\u2019s site that account for about 10 percent of sales. While the company manages its own Facebook site, it also allows Meet Social to take over the page and to troubleshoot difficulties and keep up with ad trends.\u201cWe want to establish our brand, let more and more people know about us,\u201d Mr. Hong said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty effective to put ads on Facebook; the site has a lot of traffic. Many people in the West use Facebook.\u201dMeet Social is one of seven official Facebook advertising resellers in China. Others serve much the same role. Often their presence is welcome because even for tech sophisticates, doing business across the Great Firewall can be tricky.Ben Liu, 35, an entrepreneur and a former Alibaba employee, said the Facebook page he had set up for his electric skateboard company, Maxfind, was blocked in 2017 by the social network. He suspects that his employees signed in and out of the company\u2019s Facebook account from personal accounts, and all of that activity caused the company\u2019s page to be flagged as suspicious.Now Mr. Liu uses a Facebook agent similar to Meet Social. Maxfind spends around $100 to $200 a day on Facebook and has considered shelling out more for an American ad agency to spiff up its brand building, he said.But so dominant are local internet companies that even when discussing ads placed on Facebook, Maxfind\u2019s employees find it easier to do so using WeChat, the ubiquitous social media app run by the Chinese internet giant Tencent. People are more comfortable using WeChat to ask questions of the Facebook ad reseller, Mr. Liu said.\u201cMost communications are done by WeChat,\u201d he said.Advertising on Facebook has also shown him how much of a cultural gap can exist between China and the rest of the world. One of Maxfind\u2019s Facebook ads fell afoul of copyright claims for music it used in the ad, he said. And Mr. Liu said he was surprised when another of his ads on the social network was blocked by the company for being discriminatory. The ad had used the term \u201cfat.\u201d "}, {"title": "\u201860 Minutes\u2019 Veteran Is Named the Show\u2019s New Boss", "category": "Business", "id": "810ec310-4829-4d71-ba92-681aa761df78", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/business/media/60-minutes-bill-owens.html", "publishdate": 20190207, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/07/business/07SIXTYMINUTES-01/merlin_150283563_ed7df12c-610b-470e-a083-8237be896a0a-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "There\u2019s a new boss at \u201c60 Minutes.\u201dThe signature newsmagazine, which has held down a Sunday night slot for CBS since 1968, named Bill Owens as its executive producer.Mr. Owens served as the longtime No. 2 to Jeff Fager, who ran the program from 2004 until he was fired in September after having sent a threatening text message to a CBS reporter who was asking about allegations of harassment against him for a segment that ran on \u201cCBS Evening News.\u201d Since Mr. Fager\u2019s ouster, Mr. Owens has been the interim executive producer of \u201c60 Minutes.\u201dIn its announcement, CBS said Mr. Owens would report directly to Susan Zirinsky, the incoming president and senior executive producer of CBS News. That was a telling inclusion. Outside lawyers who conducted a monthslong investigation of sexual harassment at the network last year reported that the separation of the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d staff from the rest of the news division meant that the show was unable to prevent inappropriate conduct by some of its top executives.The investigation started in August with the purpose of examining allegations involving Leslie Moonves, the former chief executive of the CBS Corporation, as well as the workplace environment at CBS News and \u201ccultural issues at all levels of CBS.\u201d Mr. Moonves was ousted in September, and the company\u2019s board determined that he had been fired for cause after the investigators\u2019 report was filed in December. Another prominent CBS employee, Charlie Rose, a co-anchor of \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d and a correspondent on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d was fired in 2017 after multiple accusations of sexual harassment were made against him. (Mr. Moonves and Mr. Rose have denied the allegations against them.)In a statement, Ms. Zirinsky praised Mr. Owens, a popular figure among the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d rank and file who got his first experience at CBS as a summer intern in 1988.\u201cBill Owens is steeped in the storytelling style audiences have come to expect from \u201860 Minutes,\u2019\u201d Ms. Zirinsky said. \u201cWe are fortunate to be able to put such a talented veteran in charge of this iconic program.\u201dMr. Owens joined \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2003, working with the correspondent Scott Pelley to cover Hurricane Katrina and the genocide in Sudan. After a stint at \u201cCBS Evening News,\u201d he rejoined the newsmagazine in 2007 as a senior broadcast producer. In 2008 he was named executive editor.\u201cTo be named the executive producer of \u201860 Minutes\u2019 is an inspiring responsibility and a privilege,\u201d Mr. Owens said in a news release. \u201cI am honored to work alongside the best journalists in the business who cover the most important stories from around the world. I promise that will never change.\u201dMr. Owens is the third executive producer of the newsmagazine in its more than 50-year history. The show has maintained high ratings throughout its time on the air, and remains among the top 10 most-viewed television programs.Its founder was Don Hewitt, a journalistic legend who led the show for 36 years. But, as The New York Times reported in December, investigators who examined the corporate culture at the network revealed that CBS continued to pay a settlement to a woman who claimed that he had sexually assaulted her on repeated occasions and destroyed her career. The settlement, reached in the 1990s, was amended multiple times, including last year. In total, CBS agreed to pay the former employee more than $5 million.Ms. Zirinsky, the first woman to lead CBS News, met with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d employees to tell them of the appointment of Mr. Owens on Wednesday afternoon. Shortly afterward, she sent an email to the staff that said, in part, \u201cWe are in a new era. As an organization, and as an industry, we are forever changed.\u201d"}, {"title": "Virginia Republican Was Top Editor of Yearbook That Included Blackface Photos and Racist Slurs", "category": "Politics", "id": "17aec76f-2fff-4eee-9350-e1e49cd80c71", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/us/politics/thomas-norment-yearbook-racist.html", "publishdate": 20190207, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/08/us/politics/08norment1/merlin_150322452_6056d098-fdea-4086-89ab-471aa5cdd83b-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Thomas K. Norment Jr., the powerful Republican majority leader in the Virginia Senate, was a top editor of a 1968 college yearbook that included several photographs of students in blackface as well as racist slurs.Mr. Norment, 72, a longtime fixture and political broker in the State Legislature, is the first Republican to be swept up in Virginia\u2019s ongoing political crisis over racist behavior in the past. The Virginian-Pilot newspaper first reported on the photos and material on Thursday.As a senior at Virginia Military Institute, then an all-male college that was sometimes called \u201cthe West Point of the South,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Norment was managing editor of the 1968 edition of the Bomb yearbook. That edition included students in blackface and slurs aimed at African-Americans, Asians and Jews, according to a copy viewed by The New York Times.Mr. Norment, in a statement released by his office Thursday, said, \u201cThe use of blackface is abhorrent in our society and I emphatically condemn it.\u201d He said he was part of a seven-member team at the Bomb, \u201ca 359-page yearbook,\u201d and added, \u201cI cannot endorse or associate myself with every photo, entry, or word on each page.\u201d He noted that he did not appear in the offensive pictures and said he did not take those photos.ImageMr. Norment is the first Republican to be swept into Virginia\u2019s ongoing crisis of racist scandals.CreditSteve Helber/Associated PressThe images surfaced in the wake of acknowledgments by two Virginia leaders, Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring, that they had each worn blackface as young men. The admissions by those two Democrats have plunged Virginia into turmoil and led to calls for both men\u2019s resignations. A third Democratic leader, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, is facing an allegation of sexual assault.The Bomb yearbook includes a photograph of two smiling people in blackface holding a football, one with a cigarette and white military hat. In another photo, a young man is in blackface posing with others apparently at a party.The yearbook includes page after page of seniors posed in starched white military shirts, or sometimes informally, accompanied by breezy descriptions of their sports and social activities. Some of these descriptions refer to students with slurs and obscenities.Virginia Military Institute, founded two decades before the Civil War, is a state-supported academy that has long been favored by prominent Virginia families. It only admitted African-Americans in 1968, the year that Mr. Norment graduated. Women were first admitted about three decades later.Mr. Northam, the governor, graduated from the institute in 1981, where his yearbook entry included the nickname \u201cCoonman.\u2019\u2019 He went on to Eastern Virginia Medical School, where a photograph from his 1984 yearbook page surfaced last week showing a figure in blackface and another in K.K.K. robes.A statement by Mr. Norment on the yearbook\u2019s page dedicated to its editors, reads, \u201cIt has been the objective of this year\u2019s Bomb staff to concentrate on the VMI as it exists in actuality, not in theory.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: Jeff Bezos, Blackmail and \u2018Below the Belt\u2019 Selfies", "category": "Business", "id": "67cf5155-753b-4f30-be1c-71304379fb13", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/business/dealbook/jeff-bezos-blackmail.html", "publishdate": 20190208, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/09/business/09db-newsletter-bezos/merlin_150333240_cd75dfbd-e2d3-4f83-968d-2673850054b6-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Friday. Want this by email? Sign up here.Bezos lays bare his National Enquirer fightJeff Bezos last night accused The National Enquirer of \u201cextortion and blackmail\u201d \u2014 with a very public account of a conspiracy theory involving the White House, an affair and at least one \u201cbelow the belt\u201d selfie.Context: In December, the tabloid published an expos\u00e9 of Mr. Bezos\u2019s affair with a TV personality, Lauren S\u00e1nchez, minutes after the Amazon chief announced that he was separating from his wife. The Enquirer published what it said were text messages between Mr. Bezos and Ms. S\u00e1nchez.The political angle: Speculation ensued that the report had arisen out of the closeness of The Enquirer\u2019s chief, David Pecker, to the White House. Mr. Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has admitted asking the publisher to pay $150,000 to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, to protect Mr. Trump\u2019s election prospects, after she claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump. And Mr. Trump apparently has a distaste for reporting on him by the WaPo, which Mr. Bezos owns.The alleged blackmail: This week, according to emails published by Mr. Bezos, a lawyer for The Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., proposed withholding compromising photographs. In exchange, the billionaire would publicly deny that The Enquirer\u2019s coverage was politically motivated.But Mr. Bezos wouldn\u2019t play ball: Instead, he wrote a blog post explaining what The Enquirer is said to have demanded. As the NYT put it, Mr. Bezos \u201cpulled together random strands of the yearlong legal drama involving the president, American Media and the allegedly illegal payments to women.\u201dMr. Bezos\u2019s bottom line: \u201cOf course I don\u2019t want personal photos published, but I also won\u2019t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks, and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.\u201dLampert got approval for his Sears deal. And a scolding.A federal judge approved Eddie Lampert\u2019s $5.2 billion takeover bid for Sears at a court hearing yesterday, letting the bankrupt retailer\u2019s C.E.O. try to turn the company around. But the judge also urged Mr. Lampert to avoid becoming a \u201ccartoon character.\u201dMore from Michael Corkery of the NYT:The hearing was also a referendum on Mr. Lampert, the company\u2019s chief executive and largest shareholder who has controlled Sears since 2005.Many of the company\u2019s creditors accused Mr. Lampert and his hedge fund, ESL Investments, of running Sears into the ground, racking up losses and falling behind competitors, while spinning off the company\u2019s most valuable assets in ways that enriched his hedge fund.A lawyer for several Sears vendors, referring to the message to Mr. Lampert, said: \u201cThe judge was warning that you claim to want to save tens of thousands of jobs, I hope that is what you do and not end up liquidating the company over the next few years.\u201dImageStephen Schwarzman of Blackstone.CreditGian Ehrenzeller/EPA-EFE/RexBusiness leaders pressure Trump for a trade dealWe\u2019re now just three weeks from the deadline for an agreement between the U.S. and China. With neither side budging yet, executives are calling for compromise.The stakes are high. If no deal is reached by March 1, President Trump plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent, from 10 percent. So far, there has been little sign of a pact, and fears that it won\u2019t arrive grew yesterday when Mr. Trump said he would not meet with President Xi Jinping of China before the deadline.Business chiefs are warning of the potential fallout. For instance, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone \u201chas been phoning Mr. Trump and his senior advisers to warn that the failure to strike a deal will undermine the economy and roil markets,\u201d according to Bob Davis of the WSJ.And China is being asked to give a little. \u201cMr. Schwarzman and other business leaders, including former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, are urging senior Chinese officials to make enough concessions to U.S. negotiators to allow Mr. Trump to claim a victory,\u201d Mr. Davis adds. \u201cThat includes agreeing to a way the U.S. can enforce the deal should China fall short of its commitments.\u201dWashington might start small. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s outside advisers remain convinced the two sides will reach a deal, even if it is a limited pact that involves mainly purchases and pledges China has already made to gradually open the auto, financial services and other markets,\u201d Mr. Davis writes. \u201cThe two sides could then agree to negotiate further over tougher issues.\u201dWill BB&T\u2019s big deal spark more bank mergers?The lender\u2019s $28 billion acquisition of SunTrust is the biggest in the banking industry since the 2008 financial crisis. The question is whether it will unleash a long-awaited wave of consolidation.Many have been predicting mergers for a while. Two years ago, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase said, \u201cThere are too many banks.\u201d Last month, Bank of America\u2019s C.E.O., Brian Moynihan, predicted, \u201cThere are now 6,000 odd banks, and you\u2019ll find them continuing to consolidate.\u201dBanding together makes sense. Mergers help smaller lenders gain scale to compete against national rivals and pool expenses to invest in technology. \u201cThe world is changing and we have to change,\u201d Kelly King, BB&T\u2019s chairman and C.E.O., told the WSJ about his company\u2019s deal.It\u2019s a good time to merge. A loosening of regulations in Washington under the Trump administration helped persuade the banks to explore combining. (Not everyone is happy with that: Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Maxine Waters, both Democrats, are pushing for close scrutiny of the transaction.)F.O.M.O. could force others to act. Nobody wants to be left behind if things take off. \u201cWhen a deal like this is done it makes everybody who is a mid-sized bank sort of sit back and say, \u2018Well, what are we going to do?\u2019 \u201d Bill Harrison, a former C.E.O. of JPMorgan, told the FT.A fight may be brewing at the top of SoftBankThe company\u2019s Vision Fund is the biggest tech investor in the world, with designs on shaping the future by creating a web of closely linked companies. But two of its top executives have feuded with each other, according to Bloomberg, raising questions about whether SoftBank and its chief, Masayoshi Son, can achieve that goal.\u2022 SoftBank\u2019s C.O.O., Marcelo Claure, was originally tasked with helping the company\u2019s portfolio of investments work more closely. But he fought with Rajiv Misra, the head of the Vision Fund, Bloomberg reports.\u2022 Mr. Misra won an important battle: \u201cThe staff Claure has been hiring to improve operations were shifted over to work for Misra at the Vision Fund instead,\u201d according to Bloomberg. Mr. Claure now has reduced responsibilities.\u2022 The two men played down any disagreements in a joint interview. \u201cOur shared passion for our work should not be misread as tension,\u201d Mr. Claure told Bloomberg.\u2022 The squabble creates a headache for their boss. \u201cMasa probably finds this whole thing frustrating,\u201d the analyst Chris Lane told Bloomberg. \u201cHe should be able to go and meddle everywhere, but he doesn\u2019t have time for that and wants Marcelo to do it on his behalf. But what he really did was put two peers of equal stature in conflict.\u201dImageRepresentative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, center.CreditAlex Wong/Getty ImagesA Democratic manifesto for saving the planetA liberal group of Democrats unveiled their \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d yesterday, which calls for the U.S. to eliminate additional emissions of carbon by 2030, Lisa Friedman and Glenn Thrush of the NYT write:\u2022 Drafted by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward Markey, the measure is meant to be \u201ca grand strategy that combats climate change, creates jobs and offers an affirmative response to the challenge to core party values posed by President Trump.\u201d\u2022 \u201cIt includes a 10-year commitment to convert \u2018100 percent of the power demand in the United States\u2019 to \u2018clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources,\u2019 to upgrade \u2018all existing buildings\u2019 to meet energy efficiency requirements, and to expand high-speed rail so broadly that most air travel would be rendered obsolete.\u201d\u2022 But \u201cthe resolution has more breadth than detail and is so ambitious that Republicans greeted it with derision,\u201d Ms. Friedman and Mr. Thrush add. And its legislative prospects are bleak; Speaker Nancy Pelosi reportedly has no plan to bring the resolution in its current form up for a vote.Weird ads backfire for a fintech start-up\u201cTo the 12,750 people who ordered a single takeaway on Valentine\u2019s Day: You O.K. hun?\u201d So read an ad for the payment app Revolut that was placed in the London Underground.But Revolut doesn\u2019t have access to that kind of data.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He had to appear in proximity to the Confederate monuments that dot courthouse lawns and Civil War battlefields across Virginia without raising a whisper.In the end, Mr. Wilder won by less than one-half of 1 percent of the vote \u2014 far closer than polls indicated he would. His white fellow Democrats at the top of the ticket, tellingly, won by a far greater margin. Still, as John Warner, the former Republican senator of Virginia, put it recently, \u201cIt was a monumental chapter not just in Virginia history but in American history.\u201dImageL.

Campbell/The LIFE Picture Collection, via Getty ImagesThat state history on race and politics is now under intense scrutiny. Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark Herring, both Democrats, are facing calls to resign for wearing blackface in separate incidents as young men. The most powerful Republican state senator, Thomas K. Norment Jr., is defending himself for his role decades ago editing a college yearbook that contained racist photos and slurs. Meanwhile, Lt. Gov. Justin E. Fairfax, the state\u2019s second black politician to win statewide office, is facing two allegations of sexual assault that has imperiled his job and likely extinguished his hopes to someday be elected Virginia\u2019s second black governor.The revelations of not-so-long-ago racist behavior by top leaders, which turned the Capitol into a veritable soundstage for a mind-bending political thriller over the last week, are testing the state\u2019s image as a progressive-minded, New South beacon that backed Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for president.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]With the political crisis showing few signs of abating \u2014 Virginia\u2019s Democratic congressional delegation renewed calls Thursday night for Mr. Northam to resign \u2014 the major question is how willing Virginia\u2019s leaders and voters are to punish the transgressions of a younger Mr. Northam and Mr. Herring for behavior from a less-enlightened era before Mr. Wilder\u2019s election.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to have a greater understanding all-around of what Virginia was like, and I\u2019m not sure today\u2019s standards should go back 30 to 40 years ago, when people were in college,\u201d said Jerry Kilgore, a former state attorney general.In truth, the firestorm over blackface photos is only the latest example of Virginia suffering humiliations over racism that cause pain to its residents and tarnish its well-burnished reputation. The state\u2019s ample self-regard has suffered blow after blow, in part because of its unwillingness to fully reckon with a past that, while not as violent toward its black citizens, was no less ugly than its Deep South brethren.In 2006, then-Senator George F. Allen, a Republican, stumbled into the national spotlight by pointing a finger at an Indian-American Democrat videotaping his campaign appearance and referring to the tracker as \u201cmacaca,\u201d a slur for dark-skinned Africans.In 2017, a simmering local clash in Charlottesville over the city\u2019s Robert E. Lee statue became a worldwide story when a white supremacist rally turned deadly. A year later, for their 2018 nominee for Senate, Republicans backed Corey Stewart, a county official who ran an even balder version of President Trump\u2019s campaign, targeting immigrants and vowing to protect Virginia\u2019s emblems of the Confederacy. (This is to say nothing of the squalid scandal involving the last Republican governor, Robert F. McDonnell, whose term ended in disgrace after he was found to have taken more than $175,000 in loans and gifts from an access-seeking Richmond dietary supplement maker.)ImageA statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee stands in the Old House Chamber at the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond.CreditDrew Angerer/Getty ImagesBut the cascade of revelations here since the racist images from Mr. Northam\u2019s yearbook surfaced last Friday has stung Virginians because the blackface imagery demonstrates how deeply embedded white supremacy is in the state\u2019s not-too-distant past.Recounting Mr. Herring\u2019s tearful confession Wednesday morning to the legislative black caucus that he had once worn blackface, a longtime state senator, L. Louise Lucas, choked up for a moment as she recalled the meeting\u2019s emotions.\u201cI think I would have held it together until I saw the first brother cry,\u201d Ms. Lucas said Wednesday night, long after the gathering had broken up. \u201cIt was hard to get up from the table and walk away. He said he was sorry.\u201dLarry J. Sabato, a University of Virginia professor who has practiced and studied politics in Charlottesville since he arrived as a college student in the early 1970s, said this week should awaken the state.\u201cThis collection of scandals proves beyond a doubt that Virginia has not progressed as far as it thought it has \u2014 and it has a past it still hasn\u2019t come to terms with,\u201d said Mr. Sabato.Perhaps that is not a surprise for a state that is still littered with Confederate iconography \u2014 the new Amazon headquarters in Arlington will sit hard by Jefferson Davis Highway \u2014 and just last month celebrated Lee-Jackson Day, a state holiday. The state Capitol is filled with promotional materials trumpeting the 400th anniversary of the first representative assembly in the new world, which is what makes the General Assembly here the oldest continuous legislative body in America. But this year also marks two other milestones: the 400th anniversary of slaves being brought to Jamestown and the 60th anniversary of Prince Edward County closing its public schools to avoid integrating them.Yet to those who are eager to see Virginia move beyond its racist past, this past week\u2019s tribulations have obscured the real progress the state has made in recent decades.It is hard to overstate how important race was to the segregationist Democratic machine, led by Senator Harry F. Byrd, that controlled Virginia politics for much of the 20th century.In his seminal 1949 book, \u201cSouthern Politics in State and Nation,\u201d the scholar V.O. Key Jr. famously called Virginia \u201ca political museum piece\u201d for its efforts to keep blacks and poor whites off the voter rolls.By comparison, Mr. Key wrote, \u201cMississippi is a hotbed of democracy.\u201dIn fact, the so-called \u201cmassive resistance\u201d to integration, which had its origins here, is what extended the political life of the so-called Byrd Organization even as Virginia swelled in the years following World War II.ImageSenator Harry F. Byrd ran a segregationist Democratic machine that controlled Virginia politics for most of the 20th century.CreditAssociated Press\u201cIn the spring of 1954, however, a new issue appeared on the horizon which was to retrieve the fortunes of the Byrd organization,\u201d wrote J. Harvie Wilkinson III, now a federal judge, in his book \u201cHarry Byrd and the Changing Face of Virginia Politics.\u201d \u201cThe issue was school desegregation, and under the banner of \u2018massive resistance\u2019 the Byrd machine quickly refueled its sputtering engines.\u201dBut even well after the death of the Jim Crow era, Virginia politicians had little choice but to tread gingerly on matters of race.Few know that better than Mr. Wilder.In order to earn his party\u2019s blessing to become lieutenant governor in 1985, Mr. Wilder had to win over one of his foes, the powerful state House speaker and an old Byrd disciple A.L. Philpott. That was three years after Mr. Philpott blocked Mr. Wilder\u2019s attempt to enact a state holiday honoring Dr. King.Then, as a candidate for governor, Mr. Wilder campaigned aggressively across rural parts of the state, such as Mr. Philpott\u2019s Southside, where the Confederacy was enshrined in history.\u201cBack then, that was pretty smart politics,\u201d said Paul Goldman, a former chairman of the Virginia Democratic Party who was the architect of Mr. Wilder\u2019s historic victory. (Mr. Wilder called on Mr. Northam to resign after the governor\u2019s cringe-inducing news conference Saturday, but he has remained silent about the issues surrounding Mr. Fairfax and Mr. Herring.)Even now, the Jim Crow era of racist behavior like blackface is hardly an ancient epoch in Virginia.\u201cIf you\u2019re 50 years old, when were you born? The \u201960s, the \u201970s. The state was just coming out of segregation. Your parents, everybody else, were part of it,\u201d Mr. Goldman said.ImageThis year marks the 400th anniversary of the state\u2019s General Assembly, making it the oldest continuous legislative body in America. It is also the 400th anniversary of slaves being brought to Jamestown.CreditDrew Angerer/Getty ImagesBut Mr. Wilder\u2019s election did not fully bind up the state\u2019s wounds, and the decades since have been met with both advancements and setbacks.In 2006, Virginia Democrats pried the first of two Senate seats away from Republicans by nominating Jim Webb. Mr. Webb was a former Navy secretary in the Reagan administration who had written and spoken admiringly about the Confederacy\u2019s martial valor. While attending the Shad Planking, the state\u2019s most iconic political event and itself a vestige of the Byrd era, he gladly accepted a Confederate flag lapel sticker.Steve Jarding, a Democratic strategist who advised Mr. Webb and helped steer Senator Mark Warner to the governorship in 2001, said that at the turn of the century there had been stronger traces of explicit racism and Confederate nostalgia in Virginia politics, especially in rural areas.\u201cThe cultures were written in stone, in many ways, and they\u2019re hard to break,\u201d Mr. Jarding said. \u201cAnd that includes racist activities.\u201dStill, images of blackface and Ku Klux Klan robes \u201cwould never have been O.K.,\u201d as Mr. Goldman put it.Virginians are still coming to grips with this latest chapter in their state\u2019s history, with Mr. Northam determined to try to salvage his reputation and keep his job and Mr. Herring doing the same but likely having lost his own hopes of becoming governor.Many state officials are in almost a state of shock, stunned that the ghosts they thought had been banished have returned. As she left the Capitol Wednesday beneath the etched-in-stone Jefferson quote \u2014 \u201cThe most sacred of the duties of a government to do equal and impartial justice to all its citizens\u201d \u2014 Senate clerk Susan Clarke Schaar said she had never seen a day like it in her 45 years here.\u201cVirginia will survive this,\u201d said Mr. Warner, the 91-year-old former Republican senator whose hunt country accent and white-plumed appearance evokes the state he served for three decades. \u201cBut it has been a tragic few days.\u201d"}, {"title": "A Super Bowl Mermaid Ad and a Sexist Audition", "category": "Business", "id": "7dbb0a71-344f-496a-b517-cbc519240c64", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/business/media/bikini-audition-super-bowl-ad-seltzer.html", "publishdate": 20190208, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/09/business/09SELTZERAD-print/09SELTZERAD-01-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "In the first quarter of the Super Bowl on Sunday, in front of nearly 100 million viewers watching on CBS, Anheuser-Busch ran a commercial for its Bon & Viv hard seltzer brand. Two women, clad in cropped short-sleeved collared shirts, played the mythical mermaid founders of the brand and pitched the beverage to a group of talking sharks under the sea.It generated some buzz, and that would have been that. But in subsequent days, some who saw the commercial were reminded of a first-person essay published by Vice in December titled \u201cMy Bikini Audition From Hell Shows How Little Hollywood Has Changed.\u201dThe essay, by an actress named Ingrid Haas, detailed a demeaning experience auditioning for a commercial starring a pair of mermaids, though she did not identify the brand the ad was for or the agency that held the audition.Ms. Haas wrote that she had known she would have to wear a bikini for the audition, but that she was surprised when a male casting employee told the women that they would have to dance in front of the camera for 30 seconds. When Ms. Haas asked why they had to dance, she wrote, the man responded: \u201cWelcome to corporate America. This is how we sell stuff.\u201dThere were no women from the casting company present to appeal to, Ms. Haas wrote, and although she was proud of herself for refusing to dance, the experience humiliated and angered her.Anheuser-Busch has acknowledged that the audition was for its Bon & Viv commercial \u2014 which did not feature bikinis or dancing \u2014 and condemned the behavior that Ms. Haas described.\u201cThe behavior described in the Vice article is completely unacceptable and goes against everything that our brand and company stand for,\u201d Chelsea Phillips, vice president of the company\u2019s Beyond Beer division, said in a statement. \u201cI regret that this individual had this experience. Anheuser-Busch does not tolerate any discriminatory or demeaning behavior. I reached out to the production company who produced the commercial, because we hold our business partners to this same standard.\u201dIt is an embarrassing situation for a company to encounter with a Super Bowl ad, which can cost upward of $5 million for 30 seconds of airtime. And it is particularly so for a spot that sought to portray women as stronger and more interesting than the typical beer commercial does. Scantily clad women aren\u2019t exactly a distant memory for Super Bowl watchers, but advertisers have been moving away from such marketing in recent years.\u201cIt is extraordinary that this is still happening after the outrages of #MeToo,\u201d said Cindy Gallop, a former advertising executive and the founder of the website MakeLoveNotPorn. \u201cThe fact it\u2019s still happening demonstrates how fundamentally systemic sexual harassment is and that this is about power and abuse of power.\u201dStink Films, the production company for the ad, had worked with a casting firm called Broad-Cast, and said in a statement that it would no longer work with the individual described in the essay. That individual was not identified.Dan Cowan, the owner of Broad-Cast, said in an email that \u201ceach actor was asked to dance at the beginning of their audition as this was a way to show one\u2019s level of confidence.\u201d\u201cI do not tolerate any behavior that would make someone feel rushed or uncomfortable,\u201d Mr. Cowan said, adding that he had cast actors in more than 3,500 ads in 25 years and had not previously faced allegations of impropriety. \u201cI have reviewed this internally with my staff to continue to make my office a welcoming environment where every actor feels safe.\u201dThe layers of agencies and employees between Anheuser-Busch and the actors who auditioned for the commercial show how difficult it can be for advertisers to closely monitor how their ads are made. In the past few years, multiple organizations have been pushing to install more female leaders throughout the ad-making process, as commercial directors and agency creative directors.\u201cThe Bon & Viv spot turned out great, and I hope we continue to see more female creators and bosses depicted in ad campaigns,\u201d Ms. Haas said in a statement. \u201cMy audition experience was unfortunate and unacceptable. I hope we all get more comfortable with women saying no to uncomfortable, degrading or inequitable situations.\u201dThe Bon & Viv ad was the brand\u2019s first Super Bowl commercial and one of several spots from Anheuser-Busch during the game. The brand, previously known as SpikedSeltzer, was purchased by Anheuser-Busch in 2016. The mermaids are considered the \u201cmythical\u201d founders of the label, which was created by a man in Connecticut in 2013.Ms. Gallop said the complaint should remind brands to demand accountability from their supply chains.\u201cThe really sad thing is that this is the one instance we heard about,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is going down all the time, Super Bowl ad or no Super Bowl ad.\u201d"}, {"title": "Why Jeff Bezos Went to Medium With His Message", "category": "Business", "id": "95bd8024-b6fa-465d-a852-f749fe3bc219", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/business/media/jeff-bezos-medium.html", "publishdate": 20190208, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/09/business/09MEDIUM-01/merlin_150333240_94cae1aa-03ad-4114-8cdf-26adbcad925d-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Anyone remember blogs?Years before Facebook, Instagram and Twitter took over as the prime spots for oversharing, people had to go to websites like Open Diary, Blogger and LiveJournal to publish their thoughts for the world to read.But over time, social media became the way that people shared articles that reflected their politics, posted images of loved ones and sent out messages of frustration or exultation.Medium, the online open platform and publisher, is one bloglike platform that has persisted and innovated in the social media era. With 90 million unique monthly visitors, it has maintained relevance as a destination for open letters, petitions and personal essays. But it scarcely sparks such frenetic reactions as it did Thursday night.That was when Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s billionaire chief executive, took to the website to accuse American Media Inc., the parent company of The National Enquirer, of \u201cextortion and blackmail.\u201d The headline of the post was \u201cNo thank you, Mr. Pecker,\u201d a reference to David J. Pecker, the chairman of American Media.The post went viral, and Medium soon found itself in the middle of a major news story.In a statement, a Medium spokeswoman said the site hadn\u2019t known that Mr. Bezos was going to publish the post.\u201cWe do not actively monitor the specific, nonpublic details and actions of these (or any) accounts out of respect to and adherence to their individual privacies,\u201d the spokeswoman, Sandee Roston, said in an emailed statement.The opportunity to publish for a nonbranded platform has made Medium, which was founded by Ev Williams in 2012, an appealing destination for a number of marquee media figures and chief executives.Katie Couric has used Medium to promote interviews and philanthropic partnerships. Joanna Coles, the former chief content officer of Hearst Magazines, used the platform to write about her experience as a working mother.In 2015, Jay Carney, the senior vice president of global corporate affairs for Amazon, disputed an article in The New York Times about Amazon\u2019s work culture in a post on Medium. Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, responded on the platform, defending The Times\u2019s reporting.Medium can be appealing because it is unfiltered, and posts can be however long the writer wants them to be. For Mr. Bezos, that was about 2,100 words.\u201cWhen people have something to say, they come to Medium, where they can say it at length,\u201d Ms. Roston, the spokeswoman, said in the statement. \u201cWe make it easy for people to publish; it\u2019s clean and well designed, and there are no ads.\u201d"}, {"title": "Lampert\u2019s Deal for Sears Is Approved, but Judge Scolds Him in the Process", "category": "Business", "id": "aabba928-0513-491e-9f45-5bf6b8be0721", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/business/sears-bankruptcy-lampert.html", "publishdate": 20190208, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/08/business/08sears/merlin_148881846_0737545f-41d2-48a3-9ef7-22503f224178-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday approved Edward S. Lampert\u2019s plan to buy Sears, but the judge implored Mr. Lampert to make a fresh start.Mr. Lampert, a billionaire hedge fund manager, could avoid becoming the \u201ccartoon character\u201d his critics have painted him as, Judge Robert Drain said \u2014 a cross between Jay Gould, the Gilded Age robber baron, and Barney Fife, the blustery gullible sheriff on the \u201cAndy Griffith\u201d show.Rather, Judge Drain said, Mr. Lampert could \u201ctake action that would in fact be of great meaning\u201d to the company\u2019s constituents, particularly its workers.The remarks capped an all-day hearing on the fate of Sears, which filed for bankruptcy in October.At stake was whether Sears, a company founded shortly after the Civil War, would shut its doors or continue operating with less debt and a sound turnaround strategy.But the hearing was also a referendum on Mr. Lampert, the company\u2019s chief executive and largest shareholder who has controlled Sears since 2005.Many of the company\u2019s creditors accused Mr. Lampert and his hedge fund, ESL Investments, of running Sears into the ground, racking up losses and falling behind competitors, while spinning off the company\u2019s most valuable assets in ways that enriched his hedge fund.They questioned why Mr. Lampert, after years of failing to turn around the company, should be given the opportunity to acquire Sears out of bankruptcy. A committee of creditors wanted to liquidate the company and collect the proceeds, rather than take another risk on Mr. Lampert.As the only bidder that planned to keep Sears operating, Mr. Lampert had positioned himself as a savior, preserving 45,000 jobs and honoring contracts with thousands of vendors.But lawyers for the creditors committee warned that Mr. Lampert\u2019s plan includes hundreds of millions of dollars of asset sales, which could result in substantial job cuts anyway.In the end, Judge Drain determined that the sale of Sears to Mr. Lampert, for $5.2 billion, made sound business sense. He said the creditors failed to prove that they would recover more money by selling off the stores and other properties.The deal is not yet complete. Sears and ESL are still working out the final details and lawyers for the companies said they were hoping to close on Friday. Sticking points remain, including which side would be responsible for $166 million owed to vendors.The creditors committee nevertheless won an important concession in the case. It can still file lawsuits against Mr. Lampert for past deals that resulted in spinning off real estate and other valuable assets to companies that his hedge fund had stakes in. A lawyer for ESL said the claims were without merit.David Wander, a lawyer at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, who represents several Sears vendors in the bankruptcy, said the court imparted a clear warning to Mr. Lampert.\u201cThe judge was warning that you claim to want to save tens of thousands of jobs, I hope that is what you do and not end up liquidating the company over the next few years,\u201d Mr. Wander said."}, {"title": "When Private Fights Over Millions Become Public (Things Get Ugly)", "category": "Business", "id": "309a03eb-6113-4696-a345-74a5e5084039", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/your-money/family-estate-court-fight.html", "publishdate": 20190208, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/09/business/09WEALTH-01/merlin_150237309_d71bd70d-55f4-4ee1-aec9-df43b6dbfbc0-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "There are private family squabbles, and then there are family squabbles that splash into public view, shining a spotlight on a bitter dispute.Take the case of Belinda Neumann-Donnelly, who sued her father, Hubert Neumann, claiming he drove down the price of Jean-Michel Basquiat\u2019s \u201cFlesh and Spirit,\u201d which sold for $30.7 million at auction last May.But Ms. Neumann-Donnelly, representing her mother\u2019s estate, claims that it could have fetched far more, had it not been for her father\u2019s interference.

In fact, legal action among family members has become a booming business for lawyers who specialize in estate litigation.\u201cIf I was mentoring a young lawyer, I\u2019d direct him to the trust and estate litigation practice,\u201d said Jeffrey P. Geida, the head of tax and estate planning at Weinstock Manion, a law firm in Los Angeles. \u201cWe can\u2019t hire enough attorneys.\u201dOne reason for the uptick in litigation, Mr. Geida said, is that blended families often divide into factions that are rife with conflicting interests.Another reason is there is simply so much wealth now to argue over, said Amanda K. DiChello, a trusts and estates lawyer at Cozen O\u2019Connor\u2019s private client services practice.The Neumann case is not an outlier, she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter the amount of wealth,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are plenty of cases where people will fight over $500,000 or $300,000.\u201dBut what\u2019s good for young lawyers building a career is not good for families that want harmony \u2014 or at least want to avoid squandering millions on legal bills.Avoiding costly and destructive family squabbles is both straightforward and incredibly complex. Family members must be willing to put in effort that may be unpleasant and difficult.Step one is to talk through the plan. That\u2019s easier said than done.\u201cThere is no magic solution to address a conflict,\u201d said Blanche Lark Christerson, managing director at Deutsche Bank Wealth Management. \u201cUnderneath it all is the simmering resentment that \u2018Mom always liked you better.\u2019 Maybe that is true. But it\u2019s advisable to talk someone out of this example.\u201dMs. Christerson, who has three decades of experience advising wealthy families, said she had counseled parents who divided their estate unequally to discuss the reasons and the ramifications.Often these talks are not about dividing the money as much as they are about defining a family\u2019s values and addressing existing conflicts. Understanding that allows parents to put a plan in place, along the lines of governance principles that companies use.ImageHubert Neumann and his daughter Belinda Neumann-Donnelly at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2011. She has filed two lawsuits over family artworks.CreditOwen Hoffman/PMC; Estate of Pablo Picasso, via Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York\u201cYou can then say, \u2018This is the contract we have as a family. God forbid, if conflict does arise, we can look back and say this is the path we should be walking down,\u2019\u201d said Zachary Conway, managing director of Conway Wealth Group.Unequal divisions of estates are often just an extension of how parents treated their children while the parents were alive. But without them around to explain their actions, their children are left to create their own stories, which can deepen an existing rivalry.When it comes to the estate itself \u2014 often a mix of cash, securities, homes and tangible objects like art, cars and collections \u2014 a lack of clear reasons for the divisions can create conflict.Paul Karger, co-founder and managing partner of TwinFocus, which advises ultra-wealthy families, said the most difficult things to divide were what he calls troubled assets, which are so complex that they defy the capabilities of most wealth managers.He cited the example of a billionaire who, before he died, had troubled assets, including a yacht, two jets and real estate developments that were all uncompleted. All of the assets were valuable, but the exact amounts were unknown, and his heirs did not know who was to inherit what.\u201cThe way to guard against this is to be as detailed as possible,\u201d Mr. Karger said. \u201cWe even suggest, where great wealth isn\u2019t a factor, that parents have a side letter saying who gets this furniture or that clock.\u201dIf an estate is going to be divided unequally, the heirs should know ahead of time.In the case of the Neumann Basquiat, Ms. Neumann-Donnelly claimed in a lawsuit that her mother had written her father out of the will and left the painting to her alone. Lawyers say disinheriting someone almost always guarantees a family fight.Dean R. Nicyper, a partner at the law firm Withers Worldwide, said parents might feel they had justifiable reasons for writing a child out of their will.\u201cDuring their lifetime, a particular event arose or there was a long time with no contact and the parent says, \u2018I see no reason why I should give my child anything; he was never here for me,\u2019 or, \u2018He did something and I can\u2019t forgive him,\u2019\u201d Mr. Nicyper said.In some instances, reaching a resolution may be impossible. Selling assets held jointly may be the only solution. Ms. Neumann-Donnelly argued in her January court filing that owning the artworks with her father and sisters was no longer possible, so they should be sold and the proceeds divided evenly.\u201cThat\u2019s how court resolves this,\u201d Mr. Nicyper said. \u201cYou often see this with big estates with one big piece of property. After five generations, you don\u2019t have two people owning it, you have 40 people.\u201dSelling assets and splitting the money is fair in the eyes of the courts, but it often does not tamp down inflamed emotions. Often, they are family heirlooms, not securities in a portfolio.There are legal strategies to address this, including an in terrorem, or no-contest, clause. In exchange for not suing the estate, for instance, the person who is disinherited is given a token amount that will be forfeited if a suit is filed.Not every state allows these clauses. Florida, where some of the wealthiest Americans claim residency, does not allow in terrorem clauses. New York allows them but with caveats.\u201cIf there\u2019s something fishy in a will, people should be able to say that,\u201d Ms. Christerson said. \u201cIt boils down to transparency and what you have and what your plans are.\u201dIf parents do not lay out their wishes in complex family situations, they need to understand that litigation is a possibility.\u201cI always try to understand why a party is litigating a case when their position is flatly wrong,\u201d Ms. DiChello said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a deep history of emotion.\u201d"}, {"title": "Huawei Threatens Lawsuit Against Czech Republic After Security Warning", "category": "Business", "id": "76554f53-3ce2-4b6d-bd51-8db7fed68ace", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/business/huawei-lawsuit-czech-republic.html", "publishdate": 20190208, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/09/world/09huawei-czech-print/merlin_149938461_292aafc5-908b-4327-9a35-239b7f7a081c-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "PRAGUE \u2014 In an attempt to push back against attempts to limit its reach in Europe, the Chinese technology giant Huawei threatened legal action against the Czech Republic if its cybersecurity agency did not rescind its warning about the risk the company poses to the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure.As nations across Europe take the first steps to reconfigure the systems that control the internet, Huawei\u2019s threat was the latest salvo in the escalating war over who will control the hardware that will underpin the new 5G, or fifth-generation, networks.For more than a year, the United States has been engaged in a global campaign aimed at limiting the reach of Chinese telecommunication firms, contending that they pose a threat to security.While American officials have not offered specific details to support their concerns, they have pointed to China\u2019s National Intelligence Law, passed in 2017. They say the law requires Chinese companies to support, provide assistance to and cooperate in Beijing\u2019s national intelligence work, wherever they operate.That law was one of the factors that led the Czech cybersecurity agency, Nukib, to issue a formal warning in December about the risk posed by Huawei and another Chinese technology firm, ZTE.The warning, which carries the force of law, requires all companies in the Czech Republic that are deemed critical to the nation\u2019s health to perform a risk analysis that takes security concerns into account.It has already led several large companies and government ministries to distance themselves from Huawei, including barring the company from bidding on new projects.On Friday, the Czech newspaper Dennik N published excerpts from a letter from Huawei to the head of the Czech cyber agency, Dusan Navratil, and Prime Minister Andrej Babis threatening legal action.\u201cHuawei cannot represent a cybersecurity threat as stated in the warning,\u201d the letter said. \u201cHuawei, according to the Chinese law, does not have any obligation to install backdoor or spyware into their products, and the company would never agree to such a request.\u201dRadoslaw Kedzia, Huawei\u2019s chief representative in the Czech Republic, wrote that the cyber agency had failed to provide any specific evidence of wrongdoing and failed to explain its analysis of the Chinese law.\u201cAs consequence of the warning, Huawei has already suffered losses and faces many difficulties,\u201d he wrote in the letter, dated Feb. 1. \u201cFor example, it was excluded from public procurement, even those that do not concern critical infrastructure.\u201d\u201cRetail activities have been harmed and the brand damaged,\u201d according to the letter. The company called on Czech officials to rescind the warning, adding that if they did not receive a reply by Feb. 14, they would take the matter to court.Officials at the cybersecurity agency acknowledged receipt of the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, but declined to comment.The pushback by Huawei was part of a broader campaign by the company to defend itself across the continent.Huawei sent a letter to the British Parliament this week defending its track record and claiming that any malicious activity on its part would \u201cdestroy its business.\u201dThe embattled company, which was founded by a former engineer in China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, claimed that the attacks against it were unfounded.\u201cThe governments in some countries have labeled Huawei as a security threat, but they have never substantiated these allegations with solid evidence,\u201d Ryan Ding, the president of Huawei\u2019s carrier business, wrote in the letter to the British lawmakers.The United States, Australia and New Zealand have already barred the company from participating in the building of the new 5G networks.In the coming months, countries across Europe are expected to begin to put in place infrastructure that would allow for the superfast, widely connected networks.Which companies will lead that effort remains an open question. But as Huawei\u2019s threat of legal action demonstrates, the Chinese firm has no intention of ceding the lucrative market."}, {"title": "Virginia Lieutenant Governor Faces Eroding Support From Democrats After New Accuser Speaks", "category": "Politics", "id": "04145a0b-18d3-4db2-83e8-e790b2680cad", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/us/politics/meredith-watson-justin-fairfax.html", "publishdate": 20190208, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/09/us/politics/09vanessatyson-promo/09vanessatyson-promo-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "content": "A second woman came forward Friday with claims that she had been sexually assaulted by Lt. Gov. Justin E. Fairfax of Virginia, intensifying the weeklong political crisis in the state and leading top fellow Democrats to call for Mr. Fairfax to resign.The woman, Meredith Watson, accused Mr. Fairfax of raping her in 2000 while they were students at Duke University, saying in a statement that his actions were \u201cpremeditated and aggressive\u201d and demanding that he step down immediately.Ms. Watson spoke out two days after Vanessa C. Tyson, a political science professor from California, said she was assaulted by Mr. Fairfax during the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston.By Friday night, Mr. Fairfax was facing a wave of calls for his resignation. Democrats in the Virginia House and Senate urged him to step down, saying he \u201ccould no longer fulfill his duties to the commonwealth,\u201d as did the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, a powerful bloc within the General Assembly. Patrick Hope, a Democrat in the Virginia House, said he would introduce articles of impeachment on Monday if the lieutenant governor had not resigned.The list of nationally prominent Democrats who have said Mr. Fairfax must step down includes former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia and Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California, all 2020 presidential candidates.[Justin Fairfax puts Virginia Democrats in a bind over impeachment.] They were joined by Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, who said in a Twitter statement posted at 11 p.m. Friday that the accusations against Mr. Fairfax \u201cdetail atrocious crimes.\u201dMr. Fairfax has denied both accusations and said Ms. Watson\u2019s was \u201cdemonstrably false.\u201d He vowed he would not resign.\u201cI demand a full investigation into these unsubstantiated and false allegations,\u201d Mr. Fairfax said. \u201cSuch an investigation will confirm my account because I am telling the truth.\u201dAfter days of intense pressure on the state\u2019s Democratic governor and attorney general over past incidents when they wore blackface, the spotlight swung quickly to Mr. Fairfax, who only days ago had been preparing for the possibility of becoming the state\u2019s second African-American governor if Gov. Ralph Northam bowed to calls to resign.Virginia\u2019s political turmoil is complicated by its history as the onetime heart of the Confederacy. Mr. Northam and the attorney general, Mark Herring, have admitted wearing blackface in the 1980s. Many Democrats have been calling for Mr. Northam to resign, but some have offered words of support for Mr. Herring.There is no clear succession plan should Mr. Fairfax resign. The last vacancy occurred in 1971, when Lt. Gov. J. Sargent Reynolds died and a special election was held to fill the vacancy.[If Justin Fairfax is forced out in Virginia, who would take over his job?]Still, Virginia Democrats have started discussing possible Fairfax replacements, with many mentioning State Senator Jennifer McClellan. Ms. McClellan is a veteran African-American legislator from Richmond who is widely thought to have statewide aspirations.Nancy Erika Smith, a lawyer for Ms. Watson, said in the statement outlining her client\u2019s allegations that Ms. Watson was coming forward out of a sense of civic duty after learning about the allegation by Dr. Tyson.\u201cThe details of Ms. Watson\u2019s attack are similar to those described by Dr. Vanessa Tyson,\u201d Ms. Smith said.Ms. Smith provided an email exchange between Ms. Watson and a friend from Duke, Milagros Joye Brown, in which Ms. Watson tells her friend not to include her on correspondence regarding Mr. Fairfax because he had raped her in college.ImageIn response to an email soliciting campaign donations from a fellow Duke alumna, Meredith Watson said that Mr. Fairfax had raped her.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]In an interview, Ms. Smith recounted her client\u2019s claim that Mr. Fairfax assaulted her during spring break in 2000 at the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity house at Duke.\u201cIt was her sophomore year at Duke and his senior year, and they were hanging out,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Smith said. \u201cThey had never dated. She had dated one of his friends. They did not have a romantic relationship. He gets up and walks out. Comes back in. Shuts off the light and locks the door. She knew things were going south when he locked the door.\u201dMs. Smith said that her client did not seek medical attention or go to the police or the university administration and that Ms. Watson perceived Mr. Fairfax as a politically influential figure on campus.A college friend of Ms. Watson\u2019s, Kaneedreck Adams, said in an interview that Ms. Watson told her she was raped the day after she said it happened, and named Mr. Fairfax as her assailant.\u201cShe was upset, she was kind of crying quietly and she said that she had been raped\u201d by Mr. Fairfax, Ms. Adams said.\u201cI said, \u2018Did you say no?\u2019 and she said, no she couldn\u2019t say no,\u201d Ms. Adams said. \u201cAnd she said she was trying to get out of there, get away, remove herself from the situation, and she said Justin kept pushing her down.\u201dMs. Watson, who has worked as a fund-raising consultant for nonprofit companies, would not be conducting interviews discussing her allegations, a spokeswoman said.Before Ms. Watson came forward, Mr. Fairfax had been grappling with Dr. Tyson\u2019s allegation and repeatedly insisting that he had been falsely accused and that no corroboration existed.But in interviews with The New York Times this week, six people said that Dr. Tyson told them over the last two years that she had been sexually assaulted at the convention, and that her account was consistent with her public statement this week. The people said she provided varying levels of detail, but three of them said she identified the assailant as either a lieutenant governor or a politician on the rise or specifically as Mr. Fairfax.ImageVanessa C. Tyson, an associate professor in politics at Scripps College in California, said Mr. Fairfax sexually assaulted her in 2004 during the Democratic National Convention in Boston.CreditScripps College, via Associated PressTwo professors currently joining Dr. Tyson in a prestigious fellowship at Stanford told The Times that she recounted the 2004 episode with Mr. Fairfax to them last fall, saying he had sexually assaulted her.\u201cWhat she told us was pretty much exactly what was in the statement that she released but with vastly less detail,\u201d said Elizabeth A. Armstrong, a sociology professor at the University of Michigan.Another fellow, Jennifer J. Freyd, a University of Oregon professor known for her work studying sexual violence, also remembers the conversation, relaying that Dr. Tyson described how the incident was \u201cclearly a traumatic experience.\u201dDr. Tyson did not tell anyone in 2004 about the encounter with Mr. Fairfax, according to people close to her legal team, and she did not notify the police or file a complaint.There has been an outpouring of encouragement for Dr. Tyson, 42, who has taught at Scripps College in California and Dickinson College in Pennsylvania over the last decade, and earned a Ph.D in political science from the University of Chicago.More than 740 academics have signed a letter of support for her, according to its organizer, Nadia E. Brown, a political scientist at Purdue University, who said Dr. Tyson also told her that she was assaulted. A GoFundMe account, set up by a political scientist at Menlo College in California, had raised more than $20,000 as of Friday morning.\u201cEverything she said in her statement was exactly what she told me when we talked,\u201d said Diane L. Rosenfeld, a founding director of the Gender Violence Program at Harvard Law School, who said Dr. Tyson told her of the alleged assault in December 2017.\u201cShe\u2019s not doing this for any fame,\u201d Dr. Rosenfeld added. \u201cShe\u2019s not suing him for money, so disbelievers and doubters can\u2019t say, \u2018Oh, she just wants money.\u2019 She just wants, as she says, the Virginia voters to know who this person is.\u201dDr. Tyson has declined to give an interview to The Times. She has said she was spurred to come forward by the realization that Mr. Fairfax might soon become Virginia governor.In her statement, Dr. Tyson described a forced sexual encounter with Mr. Fairfax in a Boston hotel room while the two were working at the Democratic National Convention in 2004. It began with kissing that was \u201cnot unwelcome,\u201d she said, but quickly escalated into non-consensual oral sex.At the time of the alleged assault, Dr. Tyson was volunteering at a Boston rape crisis center. She had helped start the center\u2019s Survivor Speakers Bureau, where she shared her story about being sexually abused as a child.In separate interviews Thursday and Friday, five friends of Dr. Tyson said she told them of the encounter either in late 2017, early 2018 or last fall. On Friday, after The Times published its article on Dr. Tyson\u2019s supporters, a sixth woman came forward to say Dr. Tyson had also confided in her. Susan J. McWilliams, a politics professor at Pomona College in California, said that in a conversation around the time of Mr. Fairfax\u2019s election as lieutenant governor in 2017, Dr. Tyson told her that he had assaulted her during the 2004 convention.\u201cI did not know who Justin Fairfax was,\u201d Dr. McWilliams said. \u201cAnd I immediately went home and Googled him.\u201dThe Stanford fellowship that Ms. Tyson began last fall is merely her latest academic accomplishment after a working-class upbringing in the Los Angeles area, the biracial daughter of a single white mother. Dr. Tyson graduated from Princeton in 1998 and would later tell The Princeton Alumni Weekly that she identified as African-American partly because that was the way the world saw her. \u201cI am biracial, but I could not pass for white,\u201d she said.She would go on to obtain a masters and doctorate, both in political science, at the University of Chicago.In a statement issued Thursday, Scripps College in California, where Dr. Tyson is a professor of politics, confirmed that Dr. Tyson \u201cshared with several members of the Scripps community the details about a 2004 sexual assault,\u201d and that those conversations \u201care consistent\u201d with her written account.Friends describe Dr. Tyson as gregarious, and a mentor to younger scholars, particularly people of color. \u201cAcademics are socially awkward people,\u201d Dr. Brown said. \u201cWe tend to be a lot more introspective and quiet and reserved, and she pulls people out of their shells.\u201dDr. Freyd, the Oregon professor who is also doing a fellowship at Stanford, said that she and Dr. Tyson have become close despite having known each other for only a few months. On Thursday, Dr. Freyd joined 35 other fellows at Stanford\u2019s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences to support her.Next Tuesday, Drs. Tyson and Freyd are planning a symposium at Stanford \u2014 arranged well before Dr. Tyson disclosed her allegations. It is titled \u201cBetrayal and Courage in the Age of #MeToo.\u201d"}, {"title": "Why Sony Needs More Than a Big Share Buyback to Help Its Fortunes", "category": "Business", "id": "a121f0b4-c8d0-46dc-9825-45d4a60fd4e6", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/business/dealbook/sony-share-buyback.html", "publishdate": 20190208, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/09/business/09db-views-sony/merlin_150333390_ec6edb50-d1c8-4de1-bc90-e4ef1e13b2e9-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________Sony\u2019s blockbuster share buyback misses the bigger picture at the company.Japan\u2019s $55-billion electronics giant said on Friday that it would repurchase 100 billion yen, or about $911 million, worth of stock. Coming just days after the company reported disappointing earnings, that\u2019s a sign of confidence from its chief executive Kenichiro Yoshida.To boost longer-term returns, though, he needs to convince investors that a much-needed deeper overhaul of the conglomerate is also underway.The buyback will be Sony\u2019s largest ever. Just last week, the company announced a worse-than-expected fall in operating profit from its PlayStation console division, which is its cash cow business. That helped wipe $9 billion off the company\u2019s market value in the days that followed. The latest move is already cushioning that blow: By late morning in Tokyo on Friday, Sony\u2019s shares were up by as much as 5 percent.That should boost Mr. Yoshida\u2019s standing with shareholders. Since taking over last April, the chief executive has presided over an 8 percent loss in share price as of Feb. 7, which is largely in line with Tokyo\u2019s benchmark Topix index.The repurchase plan also shows that Sony\u2019s balance sheet is stronger than it has been in recent years. Net cash, excluding the group\u2019s financial services business, stood at 445 billion yen, or about $4 billion, as of December, up from 177 billion yen a year earlier.

Pecker, the chief executive of A.M.I., was trying to use the photos to blackmail him and deter him \u2014 and the news outlet he owns, The Washington Post \u2014 from investigating allegations that The Enquirer\u2019s coverage of his affair was politically motivated.Mr. Bezos said he had asked Mr. de Becker \u201cto proceed with whatever budget he needed.\u201d Those are words that could inspire any employee.

The two actresses died a day apart in December 2016.CreditWilly Sanjuan/Invision, via Associated PressHis own childhood was full of the violence and fear that he is now paid to shield others from. Mr. de Becker has written that his mother, a heroin addict, regularly beat him and his sister, and shot his stepfather. She committed suicide when he was 16.He then moved in with the family of a friend from Beverly Hills High School, Miguel Ferrer, the son of the actor Jos\u00e9 Ferrer and the singer Rosemary Clooney. Ms. Clooney later gave him a job as her road manager. He went on to work as Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s assistant. (Another close friend was the actress Carrie Fisher; he gave a eulogy at a memorial service in 2017 for Ms. Fisher and her actress mother, Debbie Reynolds, who died a day apart.)In an interview with The New York Times in 1997, Mr. de Becker said his experience with Taylor had led him to understand the perils of celebrity and the \u201cmarketing of human beings.\u201dHe has been enmeshed ever since. He has investigated stalkers for stars like Olivia Newton-John and Cher. He supervised security for public figures visiting President Ronald Reagan and his family at the White House. He worked with members of the family of Ronald L. Goldman when they sued O. J. Simpson over Mr. Goldman\u2019s 1994 killing at the home of Mr. Simpson\u2019s former wife. And he helped Bill and Camille Cosby when they received threatening letters after their son\u2019s 1997 murder.For most people seeking Mr. de Becker\u2019s advice, they can buy peace of mind for a few dollars with a paperback copy of his best seller, a book that Oprah Winfrey has gushed over, \u201cThe Gift of Fear.\u201dFor those who can afford it, there is a more hands-on option.

And now that he finds himself in a mud fight with the supermarket tabloid that exposed his extramarital affair, he is showing off the same drive that helped him turn a simple idea \u2014 selling books on the internet \u2014 into an all-purpose, $780 billion powerhouse.Mr. Bezos has risked significant personal embarrassment in taking on American Media Inc., the company that owns The National Enquirer, which last month devoted 11 pages to the tale of his extramarital affair. But with a personal fortune of more than $130 billion, he has the means to torment his tormentors. And as he showed Thursday with his surprise blog post, which accused the tabloid publisher of \u201cextortion and blackmail,\u201d Mr. Bezos is willing to get dirty in the pursuit of victory.He has attacked American Media right where it hurts \u2014 its shaky legal position \u2014 and the strategy is showing early signs of paying off.Federal prosecutors are reviewing Mr. Bezos\u2019 claim that he has been extorted, according to two people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. And those prosecutors have planned a meeting with Mr. Bezos\u2019 representatives, one of those people said.If American Media is found to have broken a law \u2014 any law \u2014 it would be in violation of a deal with federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York. The agreement was struck in September after American Media admitted paying hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign to protect Donald J. Trump from allegations of an affair. Under the deal, the company would not be prosecuted for its Trump-related efforts as long as it stayed out of legal trouble for the next three years.Even as American Media fell into legal jeopardy last year, its board stood by the company\u2019s chairman, David J. Pecker, and its top news executive, Dylan Howard. On Friday, however, the company announced that the board was starting an investigation of Mr. Bezos\u2019 claims.\u201cAmerican Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cNonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary.\u201d[Read a primer on the players and plot points in the fight that has erupted between Mr. Bezos and American Media.]The Enquirer expos\u00e9 detailed Mr. Bezos\u2019 affair with Lauren Sanchez, a former host of the Fox show \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance.\u201d It appeared a day after Mr. Bezos announced on Twitter that he and his wife of 25 years, the novelist MacKenzie Bezos, were getting divorced.Mr. Bezos wrote the blog post himself, according to one person close to him, who was not authorized to speak publicly, and several lawyers reviewed it before he hit publish. In the post, he said American Media had threatened to publish compromising photographs of him, including a \u201cbelow the belt selfie,\u201d if he did not publicly affirm that The Enquirer\u2019s reporting on his affair with Ms. Sanchez was not motivated by political concerns.\u201cIf in my position I can\u2019t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?\u201d he wrote.At 55, Mr. Bezos has become a prominent player in Hollywood and Washington. Thanks to Amazon\u2019s entry into the entertainment business, he is no stranger to the red carpet and Golden Globes after-parties. And with a 27,000-square-foot mansion in the capital\u2019s Kalorama neighborhood, which he bought for $23 million three years after he acquired The Post in 2013, he is a figure to be reckoned in political circles, albeit one who suffers name calling from the president\u2019s Twitter account.Now, in his fight, Mr. Bezos has assembled an all-star crisis-management team of protectors and lawyers who have popped up alongside powerful political figures and celebrities over the last few decades.A key team member is the veteran Hollywood lawyer Martin Singer, who is technically representing Mr. Bezos\u2019 longtime security chief, Gavin de Becker. Mr. Singer knows exactly how American Media works, and he has not always worked on the virtuous side of the street.ImageJennifer Salke, left, the Amazon Studios chief, with Mr. Bezos, the screenwriter Sam Esmail and the actress Emmy Rossum at a Hollywood party in January.CreditEmma Mcintyre/Getty ImagesThis is the lawyer who represented Bill Cosby in 2005, when The Enquirer was preparing an article about sexual assault allegations made against Mr. Cosby by a member of Temple University\u2019s athletics staff, Andrea Constand. Mr. Singer persuaded the tabloid to sit on Ms. Constand\u2019s story in return for an exclusive interview with the former prime-time star. And now he is Team Bezos.Also working on behalf of the Amazon founder is the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner. It has long represented Amazon in corporate matters, but now lawyers there are working for Mr. Bezos personally.One of them, Jonathan Sherman, previously represented American Media as it worked to squash negative stories about President Trump, according to a person familiar with the situation. Another working for Mr. Bezos, William Isaacson, represents Amazon in its corporate matters.David Boies, a partner at the firm, defended the producer Harvey Weinstein against accusations of sexual harassment and abuse. As part of his services, he helped orchestrate a smear campaign against the alleged victims of the mogul\u2019s sexual misconduct and hired Black Cube, a private investigations firm staffed by former Israeli intelligence agents, to undercut accusers and the journalists looking into Mr. Weinstein.Another team member is Mr. de Becker, who has thwarted stalkers for stars like Olivia Newton-John and Cher and provided security for public figures visiting President Ronald Reagan and his family at the White House.Mr. de Becker is also the author of \u201cThe Gift of Fear,\u201d a 1998 book that offers advice for dealing with threats (available on Amazon in paperback for $7.19). Concerning blackmail attempts specifically, he counseled confrontation, rather than appeasement \u2014 and it seems that Mr. Bezos followed the de Becker strategy with his blog post.\u201cVictims often try to appease the extortionist, but these efforts just allow him to retain the underserved mantle of a decent person,\u201d Mr. de Becker wrote. \u201cI suggest that clients compel the extortionist to commit to his sleaziness, which puts him on the defensive.\u201dIn fighting back, Mr. Bezos is showing himself to be not unlike his no-holds-barred antagonist in the White House. And his media counteroffensive against the tabloid publisher has all the hallmarks of the opposition research campaigns that spice up election seasons.Before and after Mr. Bezos published his revealing post on the online platform Medium, various media outlets gave significant space to competing and sometimes contradictory claims about the possible motives behind American Media\u2019s big story. All of those theories had little to do with the idea that salacious details about the private life of a famous multibillionaire would be of interest to checkout-stand impulse buyers.In an article late last month, The Daily Beast quoted Mr. de Becker as confirming that his team was looking into Michael Sanchez, the brother of Ms. Sanchez, as the potential leaker of private text messages The Enquirer published in its expos\u00e9. Mr. Sanchez denied it. As the piece noted, he is close with the Trump adviser and longtime provocateur Roger Stone, who has been indicted by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.Then there was Mr. Bezos\u2019 suggestion in his Medium post that the coverage was somehow tied to American Media\u2019s attempts to win business and possibly investment from Saudi Arabia. Mr. Bezos and his investigators had failed to offer any solid evidence for that theory \u2014 or, for that matter, any of the others.In October, American Media paid for and produced a magazine called The New Kingdom, which mysteriously appeared on newsstands ahead of a visit to the United States by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The publication of this 100-page glossy, filled with laudatory text and splashy photos of the crown prince, coincided with American Media\u2019s efforts to strike business deals in Saudi Arabia. The company has faced double-digit losses in its print circulation in recent years.Mr. Bezos has long played hardball in his business, and Amazon can wipe value off entire companies just by announcing new ventures in their industry. Only recently did Amazon start turning a consistent profit.Mr. Bezos\u2019 aggressive stance plays out in the company\u2019s actions in ways big and small. Last decade, a start-up called Diapers.com began gaining traction by offering free shipping to new parents. Amazon aggressively lowered its prices, undercutting the upstart.Amid the price war, it bought the company for $545 million in late 2010 and shut the site down in 2017. Amazon now captures 67 percent of all baby-related purchases online, according to the marketing analytics firm Jumpshot."}, {"title": "Sanders and O\u2019Rourke Are Way Ahead in Race for Small-Dollar Donors", "category": "Politics", "id": "8b693266-3224-4751-b55a-45a391fd8319", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/2020-democrats-campaign-funding.html", "publishdate": 20190209, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/09/us/campaign-money-chart1-promo-1549725862448/campaign-money-chart1-promo-1549725862448-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Senator Bernie Sanders would begin a 2020 presidential bid with 2.1 million online donors, a massive lead among low-dollar contributors that is roughly equivalent to the donor base of all the other Democratic hopefuls combined.Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman who narrowly lost a Senate race last year, is also poised to be a fund-raising phenom if he runs for president: He has twice as many online donors as anyone eyeing the race besides Mr. Sanders.Three senators who are already running have their own solid track records with small donors. Senator Elizabeth Warren, with the third-highest number, has notable strength in New Hampshire, even topping Mr. O\u2019Rourke there. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has built up broad national support among small donors, despite a reputation as a big-money fund-raiser, while Senator Kamala Harris raised $1.5 million online in her first 24 hours as a presidential candidate.Small-dollar donations are expected to be a huge deal in 2020 \u2014 the renewable resource that Democratic candidates will depend upon to fuel their campaigns. And those five Democrats represent a distinctive top tier with the most formidable followings, each counting a base of at least 230,000 online donors, according to a New York Times analysis of six years of federal election filings from ActBlue, the Democratic Party\u2019s dominant donation-processing platform.[Check out the 6 days when 2020 Democratic hopefuls scored big with small donors.]The findings provide a window into one of the most closely guarded and coveted resources of a modern campaign: the digital donor lists that bring in the vast bulk of low-dollar donations. These online donations average just under $40, and candidates like to point to such modest amounts as evidence of the breadth and depth of their support among regular people.In the early stages of a presidential race, when polling measures little more than name recognition, the relative size of donor networks can provide one of the best metrics of strength.\u201cThe people who have a strong base right now have a material head start,\u201d said Teddy Goff, who served as a top digital strategist for the campaigns of President Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cAnd more often than not, there is a good reason they have that base, and it\u2019s that they have a talent for connecting with the grass roots of our party.\u201dFor Mr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Rourke, the enormous early edge in their donor rolls has afforded them the flexibility to wait longer before deciding to jump in, and has sparked a sense of urgency in other campaigns. Both men have signaled they would rely overwhelmingly on small donors to fuel any campaign.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]The particular power of Mr. Sanders\u2019s list was on display in late December when he emailed supporters with the provocative subject line, \u201cIf I run.\u201d That single email netted $299,000 from 11,000 donations, according to a senior Sanders official.That is almost the exact amount that Ms. Warren raised on the day she announced she was entering the race, data shows.The Times\u2019s analysis estimated the size of the online donor armies for current and potential candidates by comparing hundreds of millions of dollars in donations processed through ActBlue. The analysis does not include candidates who have not run for federal office, such as mayors or governors, nor those who did not use ActBlue.To get a sense of scale, if Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2.1 million donors constituted a city, the closest approximation would be to Houston, the country\u2019s fourth-largest by population. For Mr. O\u2019Rourke, it would be Seattle (742,000). For Ms. Warren, Honolulu (343,000). Ms. Gillibrand would be Toledo, Ohio (271,000). Ms. Harris would be Winston-Salem, N.C. (239,000).ImageBeto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman, amassed a huge number of online donors during his 2018 Senate race against Ted Cruz.CreditEric Gay/Associated PressSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who entered the race at the start of February, would be Grand Forks, N.D. (56,000) \u2014 a sign of how Mr. Booker has not yet converted his vast social-media following into financial contributors.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., despite being nationally known, would probably also begin far behind because he has not run for office on his own in a decade. His political action committee reported about $925,000 in donations of less than $200 since mid-2017, but since Mr. Biden does not use ActBlue there is no estimate of his number of donors. A spokesman for Mr. Biden declined to comment.[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]Mr. Biden does have one unusual asset: access to the Obama campaign\u2019s vaunted email list, which was 9 million-strong when turned over to the Democratic National Committee in 2015, according to the party. But email lists rapidly atrophy, and one that is seven years old is seen as a relative relic.Donors lists can take years to compile, and the biggest ones are often only developed through running a high-profile race. Email remains the dominant way to raise money online, and campaigns heavily advertise efforts like petition-signing drives on Facebook to harvest new donor email addresses. Those lists, in turn, generate volunteers and a network of potential supporters who can amplify candidates\u2019 messages on social media to build further support. Grass-roots giving is seen as so important in 2020 that the Democratic National Committee has included it as part of its presidential debate qualification rules.Who\u2019s Running for President in 2020?Who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out and who\u2019s still thinking.\u201cIt is hard to see someone winning this nomination who isn\u2019t at or near the top of ability to generate small donations, because they are a measure of enthusiasm,\u201d said Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist and veteran of the Obama White House.Candidates are under intense pressure to lock down donors, big and small, in an already sprawling race. Whether small-dollar donors and larger bundlers give to multiple candidates or stay \u201cmonogamous\u201d remains an open question, as Democrats have not had such a sizable field since the rise of online fund-raising.The findings represent the best snapshot of small donor strength at the starting gate of a campaign where the ability to raise tens of millions of dollars from small donors will be crucial, particularly as leading candidates are disavowing super PACs that allow for unlimited sums from wealthy backers.Of course, in a race likely to stretch over the next 18 months, early advantages can dissipate quickly. A strong poll or viral moment can prompt donors to give to new candidates, thereby growing their lists by huge numbers \u2014 so long as they are positioned to capitalize. Ms. Harris\u2019s launch-day haul, for instance, rivaled that of Mr. Sanders in 2015.Ms. Dunn said she saw the initial rankings less as a predictor for the coming primary\u2019s outcome and more as a revealing indicator of \u201cwho was able to use their 2017 and 2018 effectively to prepare for a presidential race.\u201dBoth Ms. Harris and Ms. Gillibrand landed on the leader board despite having not faced a competitive election in recent years. The two senators spent heavily to bulk up their small donor lists, investing in multimillion-dollar campaigns on Facebook in 2017 and 2018 to add email addresses to their supporter list and lure in new contributors.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like growing vegetables,\u201d said Tim Lim, a veteran Democratic digital strategist. \u201cYou have to be mindful. You have to be aware of major events. You have to be patient. But then, within six months or so, your investment will pay back.\u201dWhile it is no surprise that Mr. Sanders is ahead with small digital donors \u2014 he is the only potential candidate to have a previous run for president included in the analysis \u2014 the sheer magnitude of his opening advantage is striking.Mr. Sanders had 369 days during his 2016 presidential campaign where he processed more online donations than Ms. Gillibrand did on her single best day in the Senate \u2014 the day after President Trump tweeted about her \u201cbegging\u201d him for money \u2014 through the end of 2018, according to the data. (Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s biggest days were notably smaller than those of her rivals with large bases of support.)The advantage that Mr. Sanders and Mr. O\u2019Rourke enjoy is not just the size of their lists but the exclusivity of their donors \u2014 the vast majority of whom (an estimated 87 percent for Mr. Sanders, 72 percent for Mr. O\u2019Rourke) have not contributed to any other potential 2020 candidate. In contrast, less than half of Ms. Warren\u2019s donors have given only to her among the potential 2020 field.Ms. Gillibrand actually had slightly more donors who were exclusive to her than Ms. Warren \u2014 even though she counted 70,000 fewer donors overall.Critical questions remain about almost every candidate\u2019s donor lists: Will donors to Mr. Sanders from his 2016 primary challenge to Hillary Clinton stick with him in a 2020 race with progressive alternatives? How much of Mr. O\u2019Rouke\u2019s flock were drawn to the chance to defeat Senator Ted Cruz, a favorite liberal villain? And how many of Ms. Warren\u2019s boosters backed her against then-Senator Scott Brown but may not be on board for a run for the White House?Behind the top five candidates, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who is traveling through the early states as he considers a run, finished next with 114,000 donors. Next was Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who was the only senator to endorse Mr. Sanders in 2016 and is now mulling a campaign; his 105,000 online donors suggest his fund-raising potential is relatively underrated.Mr. Booker is among the most widely followed potential presidential candidates on social media (he has 4 million Twitter followers) but the New Jersey Democrat had the seventh-most donors among senators looking at 2020 bids. Mr. Booker\u2019s campaign website intermittently used ActBlue in 2013, 2014 and 2015, suggesting his full number of online donors is likely at least somewhat higher.\u201cHe\u2019s the perfect case study to show what it takes to build a large online grass-roots following today. It\u2019s folly to think you can just grow that organically,\u201d said Mr. Lim, the digital strategist. \u201cJust because you have a lot of followers or people who like you or talk to you, that doesn\u2019t translate to an organized and impactful community of donors.\u201dMr. Booker has announced that Jenna Lowenstein, a former top digital strategist for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, would serve as his deputy campaign manager, a move seen as focusing on improving his online donor footprint.Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who is expected to announce a 2020 bid on Sunday, lags far behind her colleagues, with fewer than 38,000 donors. That figure was about on par with Richard Ojeda, who briefly declared his presidential candidacy after losing a House race in West Virginia before abruptly quitting in late January.Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who announced her bid for president in January, had 41,000 donors, but more than 75 percent of her donors overlapped either with Mr. Sanders, whom she endorsed in 2016, or with at least two other potential candidates.Ms. Gabbard\u2019s single best day for online donations came two and half years ago. That was the day Mr. Sanders sent a fund-raising email for her."}, {"title": "On Politics: The Biggest Stories of the Week", "category": "Politics", "id": "235aabcc-f2c5-4811-8572-454f370dd885", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/on-politics-the-biggest-stories-of-the-week.html", "publishdate": 20190209, "imageurl": "", "content": "From Virginia\u2019s scandals to the State of the Union, it\u2019s been a busy week in American politics.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi wore one, and her apparently sardonic applause for Mr. Trump turned into a meme. Some House Democrats sent pointed messages to Mr. Trump with the guests they brought to his address, including climate scientists and survivors of sexual assault.Stacey Abrams, who nearly became the first African-American female governor in November and is being courted to run for the Senate in 2020, delivered the Democratic response to Mr. Trump\u2019s address with an appeal for less expensive health care, inclusive immigration and better ballot access.

On Thursday, Democrats began their quest to secure the president\u2019s long-withheld tax returns through an obscure provision in the federal code.The House Judiciary Committee held an oversight hearing on Friday with acting Attorney General Matthew G. Whitaker, in which Mr. Whitaker testified about the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation. Mr. Whitaker said he had not interfered with the inquiry or provided inside information to the president.The new Democratic leadership of the House Veterans Affairs Committee said Friday that it would investigate the influence exerted over the Department of Veterans Affairs by three members of Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida golf club. It was an indication that the committee \u2014 known as one of the most bipartisan on Capitol Hill \u2014 could adopt a harder edge as empowered Democrats move to scrutinize the administration.Liberal Democrats introduced their \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d on Thursday, a sweeping resolution to redefine the debate on climate change, drafted by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J.

With so many Democratic candidates running, and only so much money to go around, whom small donors choose to support will determine in part which contenders will have the cash to compete \u2014 and who will not.So, what clicks with donors online?The Times analyzed six years of online donations to potential 2020 candidates through ActBlue, the Democratic Party\u2019s main donation-processing platform, to tally the number of donations each candidate has received by day.[See the rankings of 2020 Democratic hopefuls with small donors.]The findings show that the art of inspiring online donors is very much about timing: It\u2019s about having a moment in the national spotlight \u2014 and then capitalizing on it. Also, small donors are just like the rest of us: procrastinators inspired by a looming deadline.With that, here are six days when some current and potential Democratic candidates for president scored big online, and why:Elizabeth Warren: \u201cNevertheless, she persisted\u201dThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, just wanted Senator Elizabeth Warren to stop talking. Instead, Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, handed Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, a sound bite that she leveraged into her single biggest day of online donations.It happened during a Senate floor debate on Feb. 7, 2017, when Mr. McConnell declared: \u201cShe was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.\u201d[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]The last three words quickly became a feminist catchphrase, and a slogan for Ms. Warren in particular (to this day, Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign sells, among other \u201cpersisted\u201d items a \u201cpurr-sist\u201d cat collar for $22.95).The next day, Ms. Warren received more than 27,000 online donations \u2014 about two and a half times better than her next best day since 2013 \u2014 worth $591,000. It was also triple the number of donations her presidential exploratory committee received from ActBlue on Dec. 31, 2018, the day she entered the 2020 race.Kirsten Gillibrand Turns Trump Tweet Into GoldImageSenator Kirsten Gillibrand at the Capitol on Tuesday.CreditSarah Silbiger/The New York TimesKirsten Gillibrand, somewhat famously and improbably, was in a bipartisan Bible study class when President Trump tweeted in December 2017 that the New York senator was a \u201clightweight\u201d and a \u201ctotal flunky\u201d and that she \u201cwould come to my office \u2018begging\u2019 for campaign contributions not so long ago.\u201dThe tweet was broadly condemned as sexually suggestive. Ms. Gillibrand denounced it as a \u201csexist smear.\u201d She also began to process more online donations than she ever had in a two-day period. The day after and the day of the Trump tweet were Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s best and third-best days on ActBlue; her Senate re-election account processed more than $204,000 those two days.Bernie Sanders\u2019s pre-Super TuesdayImageSenator Bernie Sanders campaigned in Minneapolis on Feb. 29, 2016.CreditSam Hodgson for The New York TimesIt is no surprise that all of Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s biggest days came in the heat of the 2016 primary with Hillary Clinton. None were bigger than Feb. 29, 2016 (yes, leap day), the eve of Super Tuesday\u2019s decisive contests. That day, so much money poured in that Mr. Sanders moved his goal from raising $40 million in February to $45 million in emails to supporters.\u201cToday is one of the most important days of our campaign: the final FEC fund-raising deadline before Super Tuesday,\u201d Mr. Sanders wrote in an email.He processed more than 203,000 donations that day \u2014 four times more than any potential 2020 candidate has processed on any other single day \u2014 worth $5.2 million. Mr. Sanders again topped 200,000 donations at the end of March deadline.Mr. Sanders has not approached such showings since the 2016 race ended. His best day for donations in 2018 came when he emailed supporters asking them to split contributions between him and Andrew Gillum, the candidate for Florida governor whom Mr. Sanders had endorsed in the primary, receiving 8,400 donations.Cory Booker: \u2018I am Spartacus\u2019ImageSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey spoke during the confirmation hearing of Justice Brett M.

But for Senator Cory Booker the peak came on Sept. 7, 2018 \u2014 the day after he threatened to release confidential documents damaging to Mr. Kavanaugh.\u201cThis is about the closest I\u2019ll probably ever have in my life to an \u2018I am Spartacus\u2019 moment,\u201d Mr. Booker said.He was mocked for making a comparison to the slave who led an uprising against the Romans and whose colleagues all stood with him.

Some are from perfectly ordinary quarterly deadlines when, like clockwork, campaigns beg small donors for just a bit more cash ahead of a Very Important Deadline.For Beto O\u2019Rourke, there appeared to be no more powerful motivator than the end of the third quarter in 2018. The last day of September, his campaign received more than 46,000 donations via ActBlue \u2014 33 percent more than his second-best day. In fact, three of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s four best days in the entire campaign were the last three days that month; he processed more than 101,000 online donations then worth $4.5 million."}, {"title": "Justin Fairfax Puts Virginia Democrats in Bind on Impeachment", "category": "Politics", "id": "e56376d0-beb5-42ef-94d1-ddc563fd5844", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/justin-fairfax-virginia-impeachment.html", "publishdate": 20190209, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/10/us/10virginiadems1/merlin_150321012_acdb42bb-b682-4197-89f5-56d90ef13572-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Justin E. Fairfax\u2019s refusal to resign as lieutenant governor of Virginia in the face of two allegations of sexual assault has presented Democrats with an excruciating choice: whether to impeach an African-American leader at a moment when the state\u2019s other two top leaders, both white, are resisting calls to quit after admitting to racist conduct.Less than a week after Gov. Ralph Northam and Attorney General Mark R. Herring said they wore blackface as young men, Mr. Fairfax on Friday faced a second assault accusation in three days. On Saturday night, Mr. Fairfax called on the F.B.I. to investigate the allegations, and asked that \u201cno one rush to judgment\u201d and for \u201cdue process.\u201d But he is now under intense pressure to resign or face impeachment, transforming what had been a crisis for Virginia Democrats into a searing dilemma for the national party.The political turmoil for Democratic leaders this weekend is unfolding at the intersection of race and gender, and risks pitting the party\u2019s most pivotal constituencies against one another. If Democrats do not oust Mr. Fairfax, at a time when the party has taken a zero-tolerance stand on sexual misconduct in the #MeToo era, they could anger female voters.But the specter of Mr. Fairfax, 39, being pushed out while two older white men remain in office \u2014 despite blackface behavior that evoked some of the country\u2019s most painful racist images \u2014 would deeply trouble many African-Americans.[If Justin Fairfax is forced out in Virginia, who would take over his job?] \u201cI think the Democratic Party would lack credibility if they followed a double standard,\u201d said Representative Karen Bass of California, who is the head of the Congressional Black Caucus. Ms. Bass said that both Mr. Northam and Mr. Fairfax should step down.President Trump, who lashed out at Mr. Northam in his State of the Union address, prodded Democrats on Twitter Sunday for that perceived double standard.On Saturday, an adviser to Mr. Fairfax said the lieutenant governor was deeply distraught over the allegations and had no intention of resigning. In Mr. Fairfax\u2019s statement on Saturday night, the lieutenant governor confirmed he had an encounter with his second accuser, Meredith Watson, but said it was consensual. He asked for an independent investigation of all the allegations and for he and his accusers to \u201cbe respected during this process.\u201dIn another sign that Mr. Fairfax will attempt to remain in office, he has added an African-American woman from the state\u2019s most politically influential law firm to his legal team. The woman, Ava Lias-Booker, is a partner at McGuireWoods who, like Mr. Fairfax and Ms. Watson, graduated from Duke University.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Almost all of Virginia\u2019s Democratic leaders and lawmakers on Friday night called on Mr. Fairfax to resign, and a legislator vowed to introduce articles of impeachment if Mr. Fairfax did not quit by Monday. Statements released Saturday night by the legal teams of both of Mr. Fairfax\u2019s accusers said the women would be willing to testify at an impeachment proceeding against Mr. Fairfax.The state Democratic Party, after a conference call of its steering committee on Saturday morning in which there was near-unanimous support for Mr. Fairfax to resign, issued a statement saying he no longer had \u201ctheir confidence or support\u201d and should quit.\u201cIt\u2019s a nightmare right now,\u201d said Representative A. Donald McEachin, a Virginia Democrat who can trace his history here back to Revolutionary War-era slaves.ImageProtesters carried a fake coffin, to symbolize what they called the death of the Democratic Party, toward the Virginia State Capitol on Thursday.CreditDrew Angerer/Getty Images\u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard on the Democratic brand for so many years,\u201d he said, \u201cand now we have to deal with this.\u201dGov. Northam also insists he will not resign. He does not face an imminent impeachment threat, and neither does Mr. Herring, the attorney general and second in line to the governor, who has been effusively apologizing for once wearing blackface. The governor, in an interview on Saturday with The Washington Post, said he intends to use the remainder of his term to pursue racial reconciliation and has been reading works like \u201cThe Case for Reparations\u201d by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Alex Haley\u2019s \u201cRoots\u201d to learn more about experiences of African-Americans.Just how far Virginia Democrats go to confront these three statewide officials \u2014 who swept into office in 2017 on the first wave of backlash to President Trump\u2019s election \u2014 will send a signal about how committed they are to taking a hard line on racial and sexual transgressions, and will echo well beyond this state\u2019s borders.To some Democrats, Mr. Fairfax\u2019s alleged conduct is the most serious because he is the only one of the three accused of a crime. But that does not make the political quandary any less torturous at a moment when the party\u2019s 2020 presidential primary is getting underway with more black and female candidates than have ever run for the White House.\u201cTo show a firm grasp of the obvious, the optics would be difficult and the substance would be difficult,\u201d said State Senator J. Chapman Petersen, who is white, about how it would look if Mr. Northam and Mr. Herring remained in office while Mr. Fairfax was exiled.Women and African-Americans have never been more politically powerful: The Democrats\u2019 40-seat win in the House midterm elections in November, as well as their 2017 triumph in the top Virginia races, was powered in no small part by those voters. And with Republicans barely hanging on to their legislative majority in the Virginia Capitol, Democrats were counting on the same two blocs to propel them to victory in this fall\u2019s election of all 140 delegates and state senators.Ultimately, some Democrats here said, they must begin the process of emerging from the wreckage that is the executive branch of Virginia state government by turning to what is perhaps their most loyal constituency: black women.And barely hours after Ms. Watson came forward on Friday saying she was raped by Mr. Fairfax in 2000 when they were students at Duke University, several senior Virginia Democrats began making the case that should Mr. Northam continue his refusal to resign, he ought to appoint State Senator Jennifer McClellan to replace Mr. Fairfax if he quits or is impeached. (It is not certain that Mr. Northam could appoint any successor to Mr. Fairfax, scholars said, because of conflicting provisions and interpretations of the Virginia Constitution and state law.)Ms. McClellan, who is black, is a longtime Richmond legislator who was already thought to have statewide ambitions and has a close relationship with Senator Tim Kaine.\u201cJennifer would make an exceptionally good lieutenant governor,\u201d said C. Richard Cranwell, a former state Democratic chairman and legislator, when asked about the senator.Delegate Charniele L. Herring, who is the chairwoman of the House Democratic Caucus and a former chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said, \u201cAfrican-American women have been a core, consistent base, and it\u2019s important that we as a party reconcile with them.\u201dBut some of the country\u2019s most prominent black women were just as confounded about the way forward as any Democrat in Virginia.\u201cThis has been one of the most difficult political weeks of my life,\u201d said Donna Brazile, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cThere\u2019s no playbook for this.\u201dImageGov. Ralph Northam, center, with Mr. Fairfax and Attorney General Mark Herring last year. All three men are resisting calls to quit after recent accusations of misconduct.CreditSteve Helber/Associated PressEven before Ms. Watson made her accusation Friday, Mr. Fairfax was in grave jeopardy. He infuriated Virginia\u2019s three freshman Democratic women in the congressional delegation with his dismissive treatment of the initial assault claim made by Vanessa C. Tyson, and then compounded his difficulty by not calling any of them. Similarly, he had not called Mr. McEachin, one of two African-Americans in the delegation, before Ms. Watson spoke out.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a woman to be upset about the way Justin has handled this,\u201d Mr. McEachin said.It came to no surprise to Virginia Democrats, then, when Mr. McEachin and the three female lawmakers \u2014 Representatives Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton \u2014 were some of the earliest on Friday night to demand Mr. Fairfax resign.As for Mr. Northam, the governor, he told his cabinet on Friday that he would not resign. In an email to state employees acknowledging that the state is in \u201cuncharted waters,\u201d he said: \u201cYou have placed your trust in me to lead Virginia forward \u2014 and I plan to do that.\u201dBut some black Democrats are unhappy about the prospect of him remaining in office, after he acknowledged he wore shoe polish to go in blackface as part of a Michael Jackson costume for a dance contest in 1984.Yet Ms. Bass, the Congressional Black Caucus leader, and other Democrats offered some measure of praise for Mr. Herring, who revealed that he wore blackface to imitate a rapper as a University of Virginia undergraduate but has pleaded for forgiveness from the state\u2019s black lawmakers.\u201cAt least he came forward and seemed to be sincere and apologized,\u201d Ms. Bass said.Other national Democrats also praised Mr. Herring, who methodically reached out to nearly every prominent African-American lawmaker in Virginia, and said it was time the party reconsider its demands for instant accountability for the transgressors in its ranks.\u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect politicians to have lived perfect lives \u2014 the general public doesn\u2019t expect that, and they are much more forgiving than the Twitter outrage mob,\u201d said Elisabeth Smith, a Democratic strategist, singling out Mr. Herring. \u201cIf anything, we\u2019ve learned the importance of taking a step back and taking a deep breath before demanding these guys\u2019 heads on a plate.\u201dBut there is far less sympathy among black lawmakers in the Capitol for the governor, who has flip-flopped about whether he was in a racist photo that appeared on his medical school yearbook page.\u201cNortham called me Friday night and took ownership of that photo and said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s me in the photo,\u2019\u201d recalled Ms. Herring, who is not related to the attorney general. \u201cThen, Saturday, moonwalks it back, and then adds some more pain with the description about how he needs to only put a light coat of shoe polish on because it\u2019s hard to get off. He doesn\u2019t get it.\u201dFor Ms. Herring and other legislators, the controversies over blackface were painful reminders of the state\u2019s not-so-distant past and its lingering prejudices. Ms. Herring said she had often thought about a particular red glow from her childhood: what she saw when a cross burned outside her Georgia home when she was 9.And just a few blocks north of Virginia\u2019s elegant state capitol, several black Richmonders were downright suspicious of Mr. Northam. The Virginia crisis began a week ago Friday when Mr. Northam\u2019s yearbook page surfaced on a conservative website, with one photo featuring a man in blackface and another in Ku Klux Klan robes, and Mr. Northam said he was in the photo and then, a day later, said he was not. Now it is Mr. Fairfax who is under far more pressure to resign or get impeached than Mr. Northam.Deon Wright, 42, said he did not know what to think about the various parts of the political crisis. But one thing is certain, Mr. Wright said: \u201cYou\u2019re more able to survive as a white man in America who wore blackface than as a black man that\u2019s facing #MeToo accusations.\u201d"}, {"title": "Virginia\u2019s Lieutenant Governor Faces Impeachment Threat and Calls to Resign", "category": "Politics", "id": "16a5fbf6-396c-4ed7-be8e-d57666966bec", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/us/politics/virginia-justin-fairfax.html", "publishdate": 20190209, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/09/us/politics/09fairfax-react/merlin_143947065_bd4e2af9-5b9f-4144-8c9d-93181d9423df-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "RICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Lt. Gov. Justin E. Fairfax of Virginia faced a wave of demands for his resignation on Friday night \u2014 and the threat of impeachment proceedings \u2014 after a second woman came forward to accuse him of sexual assault.His detractors included an increasing number of fellow Virginia Democrats, including Senator Tim Kaine, at least seven members of the state\u2019s congressional delegation and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Some raised pointed questions about whether he remained fit to succeed Gov. Ralph Northam, who has been under pressure to resign over his acknowledgment that he once wore blackface.Mr. Fairfax, who until this week was a rising star in Virginia politics and only the second black man ever elected to statewide office, denied any wrongdoing and vowed not to quit. But his political standing appeared to be in a free fall by Friday night, when the Democratic caucuses in the state House and Senate said that Mr. Fairfax needed to quit.\u201cDue to the serious nature of these allegations, we believe Lt. Gov. Fairfax can no longer fulfill his duties to the Commonwealth,\u201d the caucuses said in a statement. \u201cHe needs to address this as a private citizen. The time has come for him to step down.\u201dMr. Kaine, a former governor, wrote on Twitter late Friday evening that the allegations against Mr. Fairfax \u201cdetail atrocious crimes\u201d and that \u201che can no longer effectively serve the Commonwealth.\u201d Senator Mark Warner, also a former governor, described the day\u2019s disclosures as \u201cdevastating\u201d and said that if the allegations were accurate \u201cthen they are clearly disqualifying and he must resign.\u201dEarlier in the evening, Mr. Fairfax faced other calls from Washington for his exit.\u201cGiven recent developments, I believe that it is best for the Commonwealth of Virginia if Justin Fairfax dealt with these accusations as a private citizen,\u201d Representative A. Donald McEachin, an African-American Democrat whose district includes Richmond, the Virginia capital, wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe can no longer serve us as the lieutenant governor of Virginia.\u201dMinutes later, five more Democratic members of Congress from Virginia demanded that Mr. Fairfax step down from the job, citing a series of accusatory public statements and an NBC News report that Mr. Fairfax used a harsh obscenity to describe one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.\u201cLt. Governor Fairfax has also shown exceptionally poor judgment in his handling of these allegations,\u201d the lawmakers \u2014 Don Beyer, Gerry Connolly, Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton \u2014 said in a scathing joint statement. \u201cHe repeatedly attacked his accuser, he reportedly used vile and degrading language to describe her, he mischaracterized an investigation into the encounter, and he sought to blame others for events in his own past. These actions do not meet the standard to which we hold Virginia\u2019s highest elected officers.\u201d[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Mr. Fairfax, 39, who only last weekend seemed imminently poised to become governor, has been under siege in recent days as speculation about his personal behavior coursed through the Capitol. On Wednesday,  Vanessa C. Tyson, a college professor from California, used a two-and-a-half-page statement to detail how an episode of consensual kissing in 2004 \u201cquickly turned into a sexual assault,\u201d including forced oral sex.On Friday afternoon, a lawyer for a second accuser, Meredith Watson, said that Mr. Fairfax had raped Ms. Watson when they were both students at Duke University in 2000.\u201cMr. Fairfax\u2019s attack was premeditated and aggressive,\u201d the lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith, said in a statement. Although Ms. Smith did not describe Ms. Watson\u2019s account as exhaustively as Dr. Tyson did hers, the lawyer said that \u201cthe details of Ms. Watson\u2019s attack are similar to those\u201d that Dr. Tyson had put forward.In interviews with voters around Richmond on Friday, Mr. Fairfax still had scattered support. The clientele at Genesis Barbershop downtown looked up at the TV and saw a man who, they said, had gotten his haircut there just a week earlier. The news about their customer \u2014 Mr. Fairfax \u2014 wasn\u2019t good.\u201cHe\u2019s done,\u201d muttered a 59-year-old man who gave his name only as Coach. \u201cTwo women? With all that #MeToo stuff?\u201dEveryone agreed that the politics had gotten much dirtier, that it was all bad for the state. But they also questioned why these allegations seemed to come out in one big wave.\u201cIt\u2019s all happening at the same time for a reason,\u201d said Patrick Jones, a 51-year-old pastor whose son was getting a haircut. This was a scheme by the Republicans, he contended.\u201cThe people putting this out there don\u2019t care about any of this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey only care about putting a bad name on the Democratic leadership and winning back the state.\u201dBut in a telling indication of the lieutenant governor\u2019s mounting political vulnerability, many of the fiercest demands for Mr. Fairfax\u2019s resignation were coming from Democrats. And even before Ms. Watson came forward on Friday afternoon, few people at the Capitol were offering the lieutenant governor their full-throated support \u2014 a remarkable abandonment of a man who was preparing to run for governor in 2021.Dr. Tyson\u2019s account, some legislators said, had rung true.\u201cShe\u2019s very credible, and I\u2019m very disturbed,\u201d Delegate Charniele L.

Just this week, new meat-labeling bills were introduced in Arizona and Arkansas.These meat alternatives may look and taste and even bleed like meat, but cattle ranchers want to make sure that the new competition can\u2019t use the meat label.\u201cThe word meat, to me, should mean a product from a live animal,\u201d said Jim Dinklage, a rancher and the president of the Independent Cattlemen of Nebraska, who has testified in support of meat-labeling legislation in his state.The push for state labeling laws is a reflection of how quickly start-ups like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, which produce burgers from plant-based ingredients, have grown to challenge the traditional meat industry. Sales of plant-based meat substitutes increased 22 percent to $1.5 billion last year, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm.Other start-ups are getting closer to being able to create chicken nuggets and sausage from actual meat cells grown in a lab. Even though it is not yet commercially viable, traditional meat producers are worried the lab-grown meat could eventually become a low-cost alternative with little regulatory oversight.\u201cAbout a year and a half ago, this wasn\u2019t on my radar whatsoever,\u201d said Mark Dopp, the head of regulatory affairs at the North American Meat Association. \u201cAll of a sudden, this is getting closer. This is likely to happen in the near future, and we need to have a regulatory system in place to deal with it.\u201dMeat producers say they don\u2019t want to lose control of labeling like the dairy industry, which lost its battle to keep almond and soy producers from using the word milk on their beverages. Egg and even mayonnaise producers have faced similar fights.\u201cAlmonds don\u2019t produce milk,\u201d said Bill Pigott, a Republican state representative in Mississippi who wrote the legislation there. He owns a farm that has produced both dairy and beef. But his worries have gone beyond almond and soy liquid\u2019s being labeled milk.\u201cThe fake, lab-produced meat is a little bit more of a science fiction-type deal that concerns me more,\u201d Mr. Pigott said.He introduced his bill in January after the local association of cattle ranchers contacted him. It passed in the state\u2019s House and is waiting for debate in the State Senate.The various legislative efforts are likely to face tough challenges \u2014 and not just from vegetarians.A bill in Virginia was voted down after lawmakers received a letter from the National Grocers Association, the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the Plant Based Foods Association that defended increasingly popular products. It said requiring \u201cnew and unfamiliar packaging would only confuse shoppers and frustrate retailers at a time when demand for such options is at an all-time high,\u201d growing at 23 percent a year.The most restrictive proposal, in Washington State, would make it a crime to sell lab-grown meat and would bar state funds from being used for research in the area because some lawmakers say not enough is known about it to consider it safe. The bill has not yet come up for a vote.ImageA conveyor belt of Impossible Burgers.CreditImpossible BurgerSurprising coalitions are forming around the future of lab-grown meat. The North American Meat Association has said it wants lab-grown meat to be referred to as meat to ensure that new products are not able to shirk any of the regulations applied to traditional meat. And most large meat companies have stayed out of the debate. Some of them, including Tyson and Cargill, have made investments in lab-grown-meat start-ups.In Nebraska, a meat-labeling bill was written by Carol Blood, a Democratic state senator from suburban Omaha. Despite her last name, Ms. Blood has been a vegan for years.She said she had decided to pursue her bill after overhearing two women in her local Fresh Thyme supermarket expressing confusion about whether a package of Beyond Meat burgers contained animal flesh.\u201cI don\u2019t care that it says burger \u2014 I care that it says it\u2019s meat,\u201d Ms. Blood said. \u201cI have this thing that sticks in my craw when people are trying to be deceitful.\u201dBeyond Meat is not, in fact, produced with any meat. It gets its trademark bloody look from beet juice.\u201cWe provide the consumer with meat made from plants, and believe that it is reasonable for the consumer and for us to refer to our products as plant-based meats,\u201d the chief executive of Beyond Meat, Ethan Brown, said in an email.Last year, Missouri passed the first law that barred companies from \u201cmisrepresenting a product as meat that is not derived from harvested production livestock or poultry.\u201dThat law has been challenged in court by the company Tofurky, which specializes in tofu and other soy-based foods, as well as the local branch of the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups.Sarah Sorscher, who works on regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said there was little evidence that consumers were confused by the labeling of alternative meat companies.\u201cWe think the issue of whether they use a term like meat is a proxy for this bigger issue, which is that the meat industry is concerned about competition from these products,\u201d Ms. Sorscher said. \u201cThe bills don\u2019t seem to be directed at solving a problem in the marketplace. It is about fighting off competition.\u201dBeyond Meat has received assurances from the authorities in Missouri that its labels make it clear that the product is not meat and will not run afoul of the new law.The Good Food Institute, which represents both plant-based meat companies and cell-based-meat start-ups, has scrambled to get employees and lobbyists to state capitals where laws are being considered.Jessica Almy, who is the policy director for the organization, said she believed that most of the state laws and proposals would be rendered moot if and when the Agriculture Department weighed in on labeling for lab-grown meat, which it promised to do last year. Still, she argues that the state-mandated labels could create more confusion for consumers.\u201cThere is no truthful way to refer to it without using meat terms,\u201d Ms. Almy said.Mr. Dinklage, the Nebraska rancher, said he was also interested in providing clarity to consumers. He also wants to protect a livelihood that is growing harder all the time.\u201cJust think what it actually costs eventually in a lab as compared to running a ranching operation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a lot cheaper and that puts me out of business.\u201d"}, {"title": "\u2018He May Not Even Be a Free Person,\u2019 Elizabeth Warren Says of Trump in 2020", "category": "Politics", "id": "26b4f052-f78d-41db-af86-826b83d74e73", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-trump-2020.html", "publishdate": 20190210, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/11/us/politics/11WARREN/merlin_150492669_609f0d32-93c1-4ef0-b03b-0871a0168e12-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa \u2014 Countless Democratic leaders have urged the party not to spend the 2020 campaign tangling with President Trump over tweets and taunts. But Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts made a novel argument on Sunday for ignoring the president: He could soon be in jail.Addressing a crowd of several hundred at the Veterans Memorial Building in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Ms. Warren said it was up to Democrats to decide whether they would spend every day parrying \u201ca racist tweet, a hateful tweet, something really dark and ugly\u201d from the president. She said the party should ask: \u201cAre we going to let him use those to divide us?\u201d\u201cBy the time we get to 2020, Donald Trump may not even be president,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cIn fact, he may not even be a free person.\u201dProdded by reporters to explain the remark a few hours later in Iowa City, Ms. Warren said she was simply noting the proliferation of inquiries into the president.\u201cIt\u2019s no longer just the Mueller investigation,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cThey\u2019re everywhere and these are serious investigations, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201dIn addition to the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russian interference in the 2016 election, there are continuing investigations spearheaded by federal prosecutors in New York and by the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing related to the 2016 campaign and Russia, and there is no indication that the president himself could be indicted or incarcerated before the 2020 election.Ms. Warren\u2019s remark was an unusually blunt jab at Mr. Trump, from a candidate who has largely declined to spar personally with the president since her entry into the 2020 race. Mr. Trump has repeatedly ridiculed Ms. Warren, often in personal terms and with racist slurs, for having in the past identified herself as having Native American ancestry. Ms. Warren recently apologized to the Cherokee Nation for having done so.On Saturday, Mr. Trump appeared to invoke the Trail of Tears, the infamously cruel forced relocation of Native Americans in the early 19th century that caused thousands of deaths, when he mocked Ms. Warren on Twitter: \u201cSee you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz.\u201d Ms. Warren did not refer explicitly to the Twitter post on Sunday.[For those who need a refresher, here is a brief history of the Trail of Tears.]Aside from the imprisonment crack, Ms. Warren spent little time in Iowa discussing Mr. Trump\u2019s legal issues and caustic persona. She played down talk of impeachment and stressed to reporters that she was focused on \u201cstructural\u201d problems that \u201cwere broken long before Donald Trump got here.\u201dShe was not the only Democrat to suggest obliquely in Iowa this weekend that Mr. Trump might meet a swift downfall of some kind. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, in his first trip to Iowa as a presidential candidate, suggested in passing on Saturday that if he won the Democratic nomination, he was not certain he would face Mr. Trump in the general election.\u201cShould I be our nominee and Trump also be the nominee \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if he will be \u2014 but if he is the nominee, you will see the toughest, strongest person standing against him,\u201d Mr. Booker said. \u201cWhatever he wants to throw at me, bring it.\u201d"}, {"title": "Flip-Flop by Fed Scrambles Outlook for World Markets", "category": "Business", "id": "5e5ddbb7-4682-4a61-9ad8-de202ca0b78a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/business/federal-reserve-stock-market.html", "publishdate": 20190210, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/11/business/11fedmarkets-promo/11fedmarkets-promo-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "content": "Once again, the Federal Reserve has upended markets.Investors had been bracing for the Fed to keep raising interest rates and shrinking its vast portfolio of assets, the equivalent of tapping on the brakes of the United States economy. But this year, the central bank has signaled that it was backing off.Much has been written about the stock market\u2019s joyful reaction to the Fed\u2019s altered approach. But the impact was much broader than that. The central bank\u2019s shift cascaded through markets around the world in ways large and small. Here\u2019s a look at the consequences of the Fed\u2019s new tone.StocksThe Fed\u2019s change of heart helped halt and partly reverse December\u2019s brutal stock sell-off. On Dec. 24, the S&P 500 was down nearly 20 percent from its recent high. After the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, began on Jan. 4 to espouse the virtues of patience and flexibility, the market turned sharply higher. The S&P 500 is now up about 15 percent from its nadir in December. Stocks of companies that are sensitive to changes in interest rates have climbed at especially speedy clips. Shares of homebuilders, for example, are up more than 17 percent since the market low in December. That suggests the Fed\u2019s shift has been a big reason for the market\u2019s recent pop. \u201cI think the Fed\u2019s turnaround has been vital to the recovery that we\u2019ve seen in equity markets,\u201d said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at the wealth management firm Wilmington Trust. BondsIn December, stress started to build in the market for corporate bonds. Investors balked at putting money in anything other than super-safe government bonds. One sign of this was a widening of \u201ccredits spreads\u201d \u2014 the difference between the relatively low yields on government bonds and the relatively high yields on corporate bonds. Since Jan. 4, when the Fed\u2019s swivel began, those credit spreads have fallen sharply. That is largely because the yields on corporate bonds have declined, while those on government debt have barely budged. A big reason for the drop in corporate bond yields is that investors have greater confidence in the United States economy and the ability of American companies to remain financially healthy.Currencies One way to think about the short-term interest rates that the Fed sets is that they are the rates at which investors \u2014 or even people with savings accounts or certificates of deposits \u2014 get paid for holding American dollars. When the Fed raises rates, and other central banks don\u2019t, those higher United States rates attract capital from around the world. The influx of money pushes up the value of the dollar relative to other currencies. Last year, as the Fed raised interest rates four times and appeared ready to continue in 2019, the dollar rose about 10 percent relative to the euro and other major currencies. The rising value of the dollar has big implications. It makes American manufactured goods more expensive, and therefore less competitive, on the world market. It depresses the overseas earnings of American companies when they get converted back into dollars. And it reduces the prices of commodities, many of which are priced in dollars on global markets. (All else being equal, if the dollar\u2019s value rises, you need fewer dollars to buy the same barrel of oil or ton of iron ore.) The rise in the value of the dollar, along with a supply glut in the world\u2019s oil market, helped push crude oil prices down by more than 40 percent from October to the end of December.When the Fed signaled that it was backing off further rate increases, that slowed the upward momentum of the dollar. In fact, it appeared to put a ceiling on the dollar\u2019s rise, at least for now. That, in turn, is likely to help American companies and strengthen commodity prices. Crude oil prices are up 16 percent in 2019.Emerging MarketsA weaker dollar is also a boon to emerging markets, whose economies often rely on exporting commodities and borrowing money from foreign investors. The weak dollar helps on both counts. With higher commodity prices, it becomes easier for commodity-producing countries and companies to pay off loans, which foreign investors often require to be repaid in dollars. This is a reversal of the 2018 trend, in which the strong dollar provoked a run on emerging markets like Turkey and Argentina, causing the value of their currencies to drop. Money now is flooding back to those developing economies, propelling stock markets in Turkey, Russia and Brazil.The FutureThe question is how durable this relief rally will prove. Even with the Fed\u2019s pro-economic-growth stance, there are plenty of remaining risks to the global economy \u2014 and therefore to financial markets. Chief among those is the possibility that huge economies in China, Japan and Germany sputter.\u201cThe Fed has applied a Band-Aid onto a broken arm,\u201d said Frances Donald, head of macroeconomic strategy at asset manager Manulife in Toronto. \u201cThis is enough to give us a moment to alleviate our worst concerns. But it doesn\u2019t solve the underlying problem, which is a sizable growth slowdown.\u201d"}, {"title": "These 50 Start-Ups May Be the Next \u2018Unicorns\u2019", "category": "Business", "id": "8b5a5067-c088-431a-b310-616bb54a8850", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/technology/these-50-start-ups-may-be-the-next-unicorns.html", "publishdate": 20190210, "imageurl": "", "content": "Hong KongAirwallexWhat it does: Makes a system that lets businesses send and collect money overseasSan FranciscoAlto PharmacyAn online pharmacySan FranciscoAmplitudeMakes analytics tools that help companies run digital businessesBeijingBeisen Makes talent management and measurement tools[The next wave of unicorns will look quite different from the prior generation.]San FranciscoBenchlingMakes software for life science researchers and companiesNew YorkBetterCloudProvides cybersecurity for cloud software companiesSan FranciscoBlendMakes mortgage and consumer loan application software for lendersNew YorkBrazeMakes mobile marketing softwareLeawood, Kan.C2FOA financial services platform that provides companies access to working capitalJaipur, IndiaCarDekho GroupOffers online sales, financing and insurance for autos and education servicesS\u00e3o Paulo, BrazilCargoXA Brazilian start-up that uses technology to make trucking companies more efficientSan FranciscoCartaProvides equity management services for investors, founders and employeesSan FranciscoCheckrProvides background checks of workersLondonCitymapperA map, transit and navigation app for citiesBANGALORE, IndiaClearTaxMakes software for filing taxes and managing investmentsBerlinContentfulMakes software for digital contentBangalore, IndiaDailyHuntA news and entertainment appSunnyvale, Calif.DatriumA cloud storage providerPalo Alto, Calif.DeepMapMakes mapping technology for autonomous vehiclesSydney, AustraliaDeputyMakes software for companies to manage staff schedules and timesheetsSan FranciscoDomino Data LabMakes software for managing dataPalo Alto, Calif.EarninA short-term loan providerSan FranciscoEmbark TrucksMakes self-driving semi trucksSan FranciscoExpanseProvides large organizations with security for internet-connected devicesSan FranciscoFaireA wholesale marketplace for boutiques and small vendorsSan Carlos, Calif.Farmers Business NetworkAn online platform for farmers to share and analyze data, buy supplies and sell cropsBostonFlywireMakes payments software for global transactionsSan FranciscoFrontMakes email collaboration softwareNew YorkGlossierMakes skin-care and beauty productsMexico City And S\u00e3o Paulo, BrazilGrow MobilityDockless bikes and scooter servicesSan FranciscoHackerOneFinds and fixes software vulnerabilitiesStockholm, SwedenKRYProvides services for patients to consult doctors through mobile devicesWashington and San FranciscoMapBox Provides mapping technologyOakland, Calif.MarqetaProvides payments infrastructure for issuing physical, virtual or tokenized payment cardsBeijingMedbanks Network TechnologyMaking oncology systemsGuangzhou, ChinaMiaoshou DoctorBuilding online communication between doctors and patientsCambridge, Mass.OnshapeMaking cloud-based design tools for manufacturingSeattleOutreachProvides a sales engagement platformBangalore, IndiaPracto TechnologiesConnecting patients to health care providers using techS\u00e3o Paulo, BrazilQuintoAndarA residential real estate rental platformBangalore, IndiaRazorpayProvides payments technology to online merchantsAustin, Tex.RigUpAn online platform for contract workers in the energy industry to find workAtlantaSalesLoftProvides technology for companies to increase salesSan FranciscoSegmentProvides a platform for gathering and managing dataNew YorkSiSenseMakes software for analyzing and visualizing dataSan FranciscoSonderProvides apartment-like hotels in citiesSan FranciscoStandard CognitionProvides artificial intelligence tools for physical storesSan FranciscoUpgradeAn online lending platformShanghaiXiangwushuoA sharing platform that lets people swap used itemsNew YorkZolaOnline wedding registries and wedding planning tools"}, {"title": "Amy Klobuchar Enters 2020 Presidential Race", "category": "Politics", "id": "68a82be7-92f2-4e13-8df3-9254c8d72e9a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-president-2020.html", "publishdate": 20190210, "imageurl": "", "content": "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 Amy Klobuchar, the third-term Minnesota senator, entered the race for the Democratic presidential nomination on Sunday, hopeful that her moderate politics, Midwestern roots and carefully cultivated history of bipartisanship can appeal to a broad swath of voters in contentious times.On a snow-covered stage in Minneapolis along the banks of the Mississippi River, with the temperature barely above single digits, Ms. Klobuchar said that as president she would \u201cfocus on getting things done\u201d and reverse some of President Trump\u2019s signature policies. On her first day in office, she said, the United States would rejoin the Paris climate agreement.\u201cFor too long, leaders in Washington have sat on the sidelines while others try to figure out what to do about our changing economy and its impact on our lives, what to do about the disruptive nature of new technologies, income inequality, the political and geographic divides, the changing climate, the tumult in our world,\u201d she said.\u201cLet\u2019s stop seeing those obstacles as obstacles on our path,\u201d she continued. \u201cLet\u2019s see those obstacles as our path.\u201dMs. Klobuchar, 58, is the fifth woman currently serving in Congress to announce her candidacy, joining a crowded and diverse field of Democratic presidential hopefuls. With most of the top-tier candidates hailing from coastal states, Ms. Klobuchar believes  her low-key brand of \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d politics could make her a compelling candidate, particularly to the Iowa voters who cast the first primary votes and in states like Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that swung the 2016 election to President Trump.\u201cShe\u2019s not afraid to just be herself,\u201d said Shirley Friberg, 81, of suburban Minneapolis, who clutched a cup of hot cocoa before the event and offered a scarf to a frozen stranger. \u201cAnd I think in small towns, that\u2019s a big thing.\u201d[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]A politician who prides herself on being able to \u201cdisagree without being disagreeable,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar coasted to victory in November, beating her Republican opponent with 60 percent of the vote in a state that Mr. Trump nearly won in 2016.ImageSupporters cheered for Ms. Klobuchar at her event on Sunday.CreditJenn Ackerman for The New York TimesDespite Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s friendly public persona, she\u2019s said to be a difficult boss. A survey of senators by the website LegiStorm from 2001 to 2016 found that her office had the highest turnover in the Senate. \u201cI have high expectations,\u201d she told The New York Times last year. A recent HuffPost article portrayed her as a demanding manager who lost some potential 2020 campaign staff members because of her reputation.Republicans latched onto that criticism on Sunday, dismissing her candidacy as one of limited appeal.\u201cShe has virtually no grass-roots backing and even her own staff is complaining that she\u2019s \u2018intolerably cruel,\u2019\u201d Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said in a statement.Her popularity at home, however, was hard to dispute. Despite the distinctly Minnesota weather, supporters turned out by the thousands on Sunday, cramming into a riverfront park wearing snow pants, ski goggles and parkas. Some arrived on cross-country skis or brought dogs wearing coats.Asha Harris, 37, of Minneapolis, said the criticisms of the senator\u2019s management style were plainly sexist.\u201cWhen a woman is demanding and wants something and wants people to perform, it\u2019s seen as difficult,\u201d said Ms. Harris, who was still deciding which Democratic candidate to support. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of demanding bosses, male bosses, in my life, and nothing was said of them. They were told they were great leaders.\u201dAs snow accumulated on her coat and microphone, Ms. Klobuchar told the crowd that she would focus on reforming election laws, including a plan to automatically register people to vote when they turned 18. She also pledged to expand laws protecting online privacy.Her announcement caught the attention of Mr. Trump, who said on Twitter on Sunday afternoon: \u201cAmy Klobuchar announced that she is running for president, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing.\u201dWhile her approach may appeal to centrists and moderate Republicans in her home state, her breaks with liberal orthodoxy risk alienating the ascendant progressive wing of her party. Ms. Klobuchar backs a less expansive college affordability proposal, has not embraced Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s \u201cMedicare for all\u201d legislation and has not joined the movement to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.ImageMs. Klobuchar with her husband John Bessler, left, and her daughter Abigail.CreditJenn Ackerman for The New York TimesFacing a relatively safe re-election race, Ms. Klobuchar spent most of the midterms promoting other Democrats running for office in her home state. She has made numerous visits to Iowa during her 12 years in office, most recently to push a message of \u201cheartland economics\u201d to rural residents and farmers, arguing that Democrats cannot afford to forget about the middle of the country.\u201cMinnesota matters, Wisconsin matters, Nebraska matters, Ohio matters \u2014 and, yes, Iowa matters,\u201d she told the Iowa Farmers Union in December.Ms. Klobuchar grew up in the Minneapolis suburbs as the daughter of a schoolteacher and a columnist for The Minneapolis Star Tribune. After graduating from Yale and the University of Chicago Law School, she returned to Minnesota to work as a corporate lawyer. The birth of her daughter, who was born with a condition that required her to remain in the hospital, plunged her into political activism. Ms. Klobuchar pushed for legislation that would guarantee new mothers a 48-hour hospital stay, a proposal that eventually became federal law. She was elected prosecutor for the state\u2019s most populous county in 1998 and became the first elected female senator from her state in 2006.In the Senate, Ms. Klobuchar has cultivated a worker-bee persona, not leading on divisive issues like immigration and focusing instead on curbing the cost of prescription drugs, addressing sexual harassment and protecting online privacy. A 2016 analysis found that she had passed the most laws of anyone in the Senate.Ms. Klobuchar rose to national prominence during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, when she pressed the nominee on whether he had blacked out drinking. \u201cHave you?\u201d he shot back, to which she calmly replied, \u201cI have no drinking problem, Judge.\u201d\u201cWhen I turned on the TV and watched that hearing, I was so damn proud she was our senator,\u201d said Gov. Tim Walz, one of several Minnesota officials who spoke at Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s event.After she took the stage to chants of \u201cAmy,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar reminisced about her family ties to northern Minnesota\u2019s mining-centric Iron Range. The region, once a Democratic stronghold, has remained supportive of Ms. Klobuchar even as Mr. Trump and other Republicans have made inroads.\u201cI always liked Amy,\u201d said Bob Vlaisavljevich, the Republican mayor of Eveleth, Minn., an Iron Range town with 3,700 residents, who said he voted for Ms. Klobuchar last year and posed for photos with her in front of the world\u2019s largest free-standing hockey stick. \u201cShe\u2019s just more reasonable, more accessible, more sympathetic to where we\u2019re coming from on things.\u201dWhether that bipartisan appeal would come through in a presidential election remains uncertain. If there were a Klobuchar-Trump matchup in 2020, Mr. Vlaisavljevich said he would probably lean toward the president."}, {"title": "Cryptocurrency Was Their Way Out of South Korea\u2019s Lowest Rungs.

Now that the market has virtually collapsed, many people young and old are mired in debt and losses. Still, many young South Koreans continue to see digital money as a way to break out. South Korea remains the third-largest market for virtual currency, behind the United States and Japan. A total of $6.8 billion in cryptocurrencies changed hands in January, according to the data provider Messari. South Korea is a major trading hub for Bitcoin, the best-known cryptocurrency, as well as a wide variety of other virtual currencies that exist without the backing of any country\u2019s central bank. Cryptocurrencies have become a cultural phenomenon in the country. Coffee shops print their own digital coins. A national television network made a game show called \u201cBlock Battle,\u201d in which contestants \u2014 one named \u201cKimchi Powered\u201d \u2014 battled to build a company based on cryptotechnology. On a recent evening in Seoul, a group of women and men in their 60s and 70s gathered at an event lit by strobe lights for the start of a new digital coin.ImageThe winning team and other contestants on the set of \u201cBlock Battle,\u201d a television show in which contestants competed to build a business based on blockchain technology.CreditJean Chung for The New York TimesBut it was millennials like Mr. Kim who led the charge. Many call themselves \u201cdirt spoons,\u201d a reference in South Korea to economic and social status, with gold and silver spoons being the best off and dirt spoons being the worst. Cryptocurrencies seemed to be a way to disrupt that social order. \u201cThere is no true opportunity in South Korea for the average young person,\u201d said Kim Han-gyeol, 23, who graduated from a vocational school and became a part-time software developer for an e-book company. She lives with her parents and works part time at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, studying English online at night.At first, she made a lot of money investing in cryptocurrencies. She used a few thousand dollars she made to buy nice clothes for herself and her mother, and dreamed of starting a coffee shop with her loot. Then, she lost nearly all of it. \u201cI felt a sense of shame when I lost money on my Bitcoin investments, not once but twice because of my greed to make a fortune in one go,\u201d she said. Even still, she added, she\u2019ll stick to digital coins.\u201cThere is nowhere else to go to recover my losses anyway,\u201d she said.Being young in South Korea can be defeating and stifling. To succeed is to get either a government position or a job at one of a small but powerful group of family-owned conglomerates that control most of the products Koreans use. This requires getting into one of a handful of exclusive universities, a feat that has become so difficult that many young people delay applying for several years.Income inequality is among the worst in Asia. Youth unemployment is 10.5 percent and has hovered near that figure for the past five years even as overall unemployment is 3.4 percent. Young Koreans are called the \u201csampo generation,\u201d a portmanteau referring to the three things they have given up on: courtship, marriage and family.Adding to their sense of disillusionment is a string of political scandals, including one that led to the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye, that exposed the deeply entrenched ties between South Korea\u2019s powerful conglomerates and politicians.When cryptocurrency came along, it set off discussions in chat rooms, weekly hangouts and even intellectual salons created just for digital coins: Could this new system uproot South Korea\u2019s rigid social order?Buying digital coins was a lot easier than buying stocks or getting a loan to start a business. Kim Ki-won needed to invest only a small amount in the early days. \u201cIt was an opportunity for me to make big money,\u201d he said, his eyes wide with excitement even now thinking about the prospect.For Remy Kim, a 29-year-old who is host to several cryptocurrency channels on the social media app Telegram, digital money could mean nothing short of revolution.ImageRemy Kim, a 29-year-old cryptocurrency investor, believes he is the youngest person in South Korea to own a Rolls-Royce.CreditJean Chung for The New York TimesOnline he goes by \u201cLes Mis,\u201d after \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables,\u201d the Victor Hugo tale of the poor rising up in revolution. Mr. Kim writes about Cryptopia, a future where everyone is equal and the social constructs that money creates don\u2019t exist. \u201cCrypto played a role in shifting wealth from one group in society to another,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has affected Korean society tremendously.\u201d Mr. Kim discovered cryptocurrencies after his computer was hacked by a person who demanded Bitcoin in ransom. In the end, he paid the hacker 1.2 Bitcoins \u2014 which at the time was worth nearly $800. Soon he was buying digital coins for himself, riding a Bitcoin bubble that peaked at more than $19,000 for a single Bitcoin.He made enough to buy himself a half-million-dollar navy blue Rolls-Royce. As far as he knows, \u201cI\u2019m the youngest person in Korea with a Rolls-Royce,\u201d he said. Mr. Kim said he had since lost much of what he made, but he doesn\u2019t like to dwell on this. (He still has the Rolls.)Last year, South Korea\u2019s government mulled shutting down virtual currency exchanges where investors buy and sell, saying that it was starting to look a lot like gambling. At the time, some exchanges were processing transactions worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But the news caused an outcry, and the government merely barred cryptocurrency investors from opening new anonymous accounts linked to banks in an attempt to crack down on money laundering.Even some former cryptocurrency evangelists warn that the best days are over. They include Kimchi Powered, the contestant on the \u201cBlock Battle\u201d television show. Kimchi Powered, whose real name is Jung Ki-young, made it all the way to the show\u2019s finals, in part by entertaining the judges with silly costumes. On the night of the final round, Mr. Jung, 36, wore a shimmering suit jacket. ImageJung Ki-young, a one-man team called Kimchi Powered, made it to the finals of \u201cBlock Battle.\u201dCreditJean Chung for The New York TimesHe still invests in cryptocurrencies, but warns others that there aren\u2019t as many opportunities to make money as before.\u201cMany people are very depressed these days because the price of Bitcoin has dropped,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt was my intention to give people a reason to laugh rather than trying to win the competition.\u201d Falling prices aren\u2019t the only reason South Koreans can\u2019t make money as they did before. Big companies increasingly overshadow small investors. Hyundai, a major conglomerate, created a blockchain platform called HDAC and advertised the technology at the World Cup. A unit of Lotte, a conglomerate that became embroiled in a corruption scandal in 2017, has worked with blockchain start-ups.A number of South Koreans have also been hit by scams. \u201cKoreans lack knowledge about finance,\u201d said Remy Kim, the investor who goes by Les Mis and who gives tips and information on how cryptocurrencies work. \u201cThey are stingy at the store, but then they poured everything into cryptocurrencies.\u201dStill, many dirt spoons hold on to the hope that cryptocurrencies will turn back around. Kim Ki-won said he would tell his parents about his cryptocurrency obsession soon. But first, he wants to make enough to start a business. He is sure that the market will turn around.\u201cI have nothing to lose,\u201d he said. \u201cI always wanted to be rich.\u201dDespite Bitcoin\u2019s Dive, a Former Soviet Republic Is Still Betting Big on ItJan. 22, 2019How Bitcoin Could Help Iran Undermine U.S. SanctionsJan. 29, 2019"}, {"title": "The Next Wave of \u2018Unicorn\u2019 Start-Ups", "category": "Business", "id": "dd2fac53-5e56-403f-8768-836d8a3103be", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/technology/new-wave-unicorn-start-ups.html", "publishdate": 20190210, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/09/business/09nextunicorns/09nextunicorns-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Technology start-ups worth $1 billion, once as rare as unicorns, are now plentiful enough and old enough that there\u2019s a new generation behind them \u2014 one that looks very different.Silicon Valley\u2019s current crop of highly valued tech start-ups, which include now-household names like Uber and Airbnb, all benefited from the spread of smartphones and cheap cloud computing. Many of these companies built global empires by simply taking existing businesses \u2014 like taxis, food delivery and hotels \u2014 and making them mobile. Some of the start-ups became giants: Uber, for instance, may reach a $120 billion valuation this year.But as those companies have matured and prepare to go public, the easy opportunities for disrupting old-line industries are drying up. Now, many of the up-and-coming start-ups that may become the next unicorns have names like Benchling and Blend. And they largely focus on software for specific industries like farms, banks and life sciences companies. That\u2019s according to an analysis for The New York Times by CB Insights, a firm that tracks venture capital and start-ups. CB Insights used a variety of data \u2014 including financial health and the strength and size of the market a company serves \u2014 to identify 50 start-ups that may be on a path to achieving a $1 billion valuation (though there is no guarantee they will get there). Software start-ups may seem boring. But many of them are growing fast because industries like agriculture require more software tools as they adapt to the tech era, said Jason Green, an investor at Emergence, a venture capital firm that invests in cloud software companies.[A list of 50 start-ups that may be the next billion-dollar unicorns.]\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not as sexy as the companies in the first wave,\u201d said Kirsten Green, a venture capitalist at Forerunner Ventures. \u201cA lot of those industries are big giant industries that we need in our lives and in business, and they need to be modernized.\u201dOther potential unicorns, such as Checkr and Earnin, are building businesses off the last generation of unicorns by offering services to them. CB Insights also pinpointed three start-ups that are popular with millennial women \u2014 Glossier, Zola and Faire \u2014 as unicorn candidates.Some of these companies may reach the $1 billion threshold quickly, as unicorn start-ups are created more quickly than ever, said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights. Funding rounds of $100 million or more \u2014 a once eye-popping sum of capital \u2014 have become common. Today, there are 315 unicorns, compared with 131 in 2015. \u201cIf you are one of those high-momentum companies, investors are going to be beating down your door because there is so much interest in investing in the next big winner,\u201d Mr. Sanwal said.Here\u2019s a look at some of the up-and-comers.Software for science, farms, finance and moreIn 2012, Sajith Wickramasekara founded Benchling. His goal: To solve some of the personal frustrations he had with the outdated technology tools that he used in the molecular biology labs of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he was a student.Benchling, based in San Francisco, began providing software that allows lab scientists to replace their paper notebooks with searchable records stored in the cloud. That way, scientists could more easily use the records to collaborate with one another, Mr. Wickramasekara figured. Younger researchers were also increasingly asking for such tools.\u201cSoftware has touched a lot of different sectors of the economy, but it has not kept up in the field of science,\u201d said Kaiser Mulla-Feroze, Benchling\u2019s chief marketing officer. Today, 140,000 scientists use Benchling\u2019s software, including academics at Harvard and M.I.T. who use a free version, and paying customers like Pfizer and Regeneron. Benchling charges smaller companies $15,000 a year, while large customers who use more advanced features pay millions of dollars a year, Mr. Mulla-Feroze said. Benchling has raised nearly $30 million in funding. Last year, the start-up tripled its revenue and number of customers, Mr. Mulla-Feroze said.The company is representative of a new class of software start-ups as different industries adopt more technology. Mr. Green, the venture capitalist, said it\u2019s become clear that software aimed at niche sectors offers larger opportunities than previously expected. \u201cHealth care, automotive, retail, consumer packaged goods, advanced manufacturing companies \u2014 they\u2019re all trying to figure out how technology helps reduce costs or how technology is going to help them build their next business model,\u201d said Mr. Sanwal of CB Insights.Other fast-growing start-ups that fit this description include Farmers Business Network, which was founded in 2014 by Charles Baron, a former Google program manager, and Amol Deshpande, a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist. The company charges farmers $700 a year to share and analyze data about their farms, buy supplies and sell crops. Mr. Baron said the start-up counts 7,700 farms as customers and has raised nearly $200 million in funding. A company like Farmers Business Network wouldn\u2019t have been possible 10 years ago, before the proliferation of cloud computing and the \u201cdigitization\u201d of farming processes, Mr. Baron added. Now, farms produce a lot of data, which Farmers Business Network is helping them to process and use to make decisions. \u201cAgriculture is going through a digital revolution,\u201d he said. Serving millennial womenIn 2013, when Shan-Lyn Ma\u2019s friends began getting married, she noticed that most digital tools for wedding planning were outdated, poorly designed or cost money. So Ms. Ma, who previously worked at a site that held flash sales for designer merchandise, Gilt Groupe, started Zola, which offers a streamlined place to create free wedding registries. Zola now sells 70,000 gift items in its registry. It has also developed tools like online guest lists and R.S.V.P. tracking, all designed to lure more couples to its registry product. The site has been a hit with millennials, allowing the company to raise $140 million in funding and reach a valuation of $600 million.Zola is one of three companies on the list of potential next unicorns that have been fueled by millennials\u2019 spending. Glossier, a beauty products company in New York, and Faire, an online marketplace for local boutiques and vendors to buy and sell wholesale items, have also grown by largely catering to a youthful audience. Max Rhodes, who founded Faire in 2017, said millennial women are driving a resurgence of local boutiques. These shoppers \u201cdon\u2019t want to drive out to the strip mall and buy the most stuff that\u2019s made as cheaply as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want unique products that have a story behind them.\u201d Next-generation gig economyThe rise of companies like Uber and Airbnb has created its own mini-economy of start-ups. One of those is Checkr, which was founded in 2014 by Daniel Yanisse and Jonathan Perichon, who worked as software engineers at Deliv, a delivery start-up. Both had become frustrated at the slow-moving background checks for the delivery drivers they wanted to hire for Deliv, so they created their own business to expedite the process.Now Checkr works with Uber, Lyft and Instacart. It has also added other types of customers like the insurance company Allstate.Checkr is selling \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d to the gig economy, said Rich Wong, a partner at Accel, a venture firm that invested in the start-up. Another potential unicorn that serves gig economy workers is Earnin, founded in 2012 and based in Palo Alto, Calif. Earnin, which makes an app that provides free cash advances to workers, has a partnership with Uber that lets its drivers cash out immediately after a ride. Ram Palaniappan, Earnin\u2019s founder, said the app has been downloaded more than 1 million times and its users open the app 25 times a month on average. And the restNotably, 17 of the fast-rising start-ups are dispersed internationally. CB Insights identified five companies in India, four in China, and three in Latin America as possible candidates to reach $1 billion in valuation. They ranged from CargoX, a Brazilian start-up using technology to make trucking companies more efficient, to Deputy, an Australian company that provides tools to businesses to manage their hourly workers."}, {"title": "Democrats\u2019 2020 Choice: Do They Want a Fighter or a Healer?", "category": "Politics", "id": "0ae672e0-bd89-4a1c-9b7c-6e3f48d0fefa", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/us/politics/democrats-2020-healer-fighter.html", "publishdate": 20190211, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/12/us/politics/12fighterhealer1-print/merlin_150489945_dc2db1a8-1ccf-424e-b73d-a96e01b55ff7-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "MASON CITY, Iowa \u2014 Senator Cory Booker glided into the state first, offering himself as a herald of peace in a northern Iowa church that advertised \u201cradical hospitality\u201d on its marquee. As a rainbow cracked the frozen sky outside, Mr. Booker spoke of restoring \u201cgrace and decency\u201d and erasing \u201cthe lines that people think divide us \u2014 racial lines, religious lines, geographic lines.\u201dSenator Elizabeth Warren arrived soon after, still thrumming with the energy of a weekend announcement speech in Lawrence, Mass. Having vowed there to \u201cfight my heart out\u201d against government corruption and corporate power, Ms. Warren roused the crowd in Cedar Rapids on Sunday not with bounteous optimism but a call to arms.\u201cThis is the time,\u201d she said, \u201cto take on the fight.\u201dIn the space of a weekend, the two Democrats mapped the philosophical and temperamental fork their party must navigate as it challenges President Trump. Down one path, Mr. Booker\u2019s, lies a mission of healing and hope, with a campaign to bind up social wounds that have deepened in the Trump era. The other path, Ms. Warren\u2019s, promises combat and more combat \u2014 a crusade not just to defeat Mr. Trump but to demolish the architecture of his government.As much as any disputation over policy, this gulf defines the Democratic field, separating candidates of disparate backgrounds and ideologies into two loose groups: fighters and healers.And the 2020 primary, Democratic leaders say, could hinge on whether their voters are more determined to reunite a divided country or to crush Mr. Trump and his party.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Bonnie Campbell, a Democrat who served as Iowa\u2019s attorney general, said Ms. Warren of Massachusetts and Mr. Booker of New Jersey vividly captured the two approaches. Praising Ms. Warren for her forceful economic critique and Mr. Booker for his forward-looking pragmatism, Ms. Campbell said there was thirst for both outlooks among Democrats \u2014 and sometimes within individual Democrats like herself.\u201cHonestly, I think there\u2019s a bit of schizophrenia on what our message should be,\u201d Ms. Campbell said. \u201cYou can be angry and passionate about what\u2019s happened, and also recognize that the task ahead of us is to bring the country together. Either one of those messages will carry the day, or they\u2019ll be blended together.\u201dImageSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in Iowa City, where she drew roars of applause on Sunday when pledging to \u201cattack corruption head-on.\u201dCreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesA range of blends is already available in the Democratic primary, with Mr. Booker and Ms. Warren representing the purest archetypes and their competitors arrayed on a spectrum between them. Senators Kamala Harris of California and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York entered the race last month on footing closer to Ms. Warren\u2019s, with differing policy agendas but overlapping political vocabulary. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a fiery populist, is expected to join the fray soon, and perhaps Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio.Mr. Booker\u2019s rhetorical space has been less crowded so far, but several Democrats exploring the 2020 race have been wielding similar themes. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, have both extolled bipartisanship. Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas Senate candidate, told Oprah Winfrey last week that he was preoccupied with uniting \u201ca deeply divided country.\u201d[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]It is perhaps not an accident that the most confident Democratic tribunes of good feeling are all men, while the party\u2019s sternest warriors are mainly women. In a contest for the presidency, a position traditionally viewed in martial terms, it may be easier for a man of Mr. Biden\u2019s backslapping swagger or Mr. Booker\u2019s athletic stature to show tenderness or vulnerability without fear of appearing weak.And it was with enthusiastic physicality, and regular references to having played high school and college football, that Mr. Booker preached love and understanding. He clasped his chest and his face at moments of emotion, usually stirring murmurs of appreciation and sympathy; in one case, he wrapped his arm around a voter for a midspeech selfie. While Mr. Booker said he was ready to spar with Mr. Trump, stating matter-of-factly that \u201cthere is nobody in this race tougher than me,\u201d his overarching theme was about reconciliation.At an airy adult learning center in Waterloo, Mr. Booker insisted that the capacity to conquer all manner of hardships was within human reach \u2014 a contrast with Ms. Warren and other populists, who tend to describe ordinary people being stripped of power by big institutions.\u201cThe most common way people give up their power,\u201d Mr. Booker said, \u201cis not realizing that they have it.\u201dForces of darkness appeared in Mr. Booker\u2019s political narrative \u2014 the country, he said, has a \u201ccancer on our soul\u201d \u2014 but there were few villains. Where malignant people intruded, Mr. Booker leavened their presence with humor: Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina senator who embodied virulent racism, became the subject of a laughter-inducing vocal impression. Describing how a racist white real estate agent directed a dog to attack his father, Mr. Booker added a punch line: Each time his father told the story, he joked, \u201cthat dog got bigger!\u201dImageRoyceann Porter, left, and Mazahir Salih listened to Mr. Booker at an event in Iowa City on Friday.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesAt times, Mr. Booker\u2019s calls for conciliation had an ideological subtext. He repeatedly detailed distinctions with the Democratic left, calling on progressives to \u201creclaim the fiscally responsible label\u201d and denouncing corporate power selectively, focusing chiefly on consolidation in the agricultural sector.Patti Downs, who went to hear Mr. Booker speak in Waterloo, said she believed he had the leadership abilities to be a good president. Ms. Downs said she was also eyeing Mr. Biden but already admired Mr. Booker for his bipartisan instincts and his attention to \u201ceveryday problems,\u201d like wages and health care, rather than more abstract debates.\u201cWe need more of that, and I think he might be the person to do it,\u201d said Ms. Downs, a retiree who used to run a health care clinic. \u201cI think maybe he can bring about the changes of civility, and bring politics down from that lofty place that most of us have no way to relate to.\u201dIf Mr. Booker\u2019s remarks projected the jaunty optimism of a marching band \u2014 his announcement video literally featured one \u2014 Ms. Warren\u2019s echoed with cannon fire. In a hall at the Veterans Memorial Building in Cedar Rapids and during an afternoon rally at the University of Iowa, she drew roars of applause when pledging to \u201cattack corruption head-on\u201d and wrangle power from a set of named foes: drug companies, oil companies, student loan companies, private prison companies, gun companies and the National Rifle Association.All, Ms. Warren declared, should be tamed through legislation and regulation.\u201cRules matter,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s why I\u2019m in this fight.\u201dMs. Warren punctuated her rhetoric with a different set of gestures, pumping a tight fist for emphasis or slicing the air with an open palm; in Cedar Rapids, she closed by raising both hands overhead like a boxer soaking in applause.Unlike Mr. Booker, Ms. Warren taunted Mr. Trump, urging Democrats not to build their 2020 message around him because he might not be president that long. \u201cIn fact,\u201d she said, \u201che might not even be a free person.\u201dImageA crowd cheered at a rally for Ms. Warren in Cedar Rapids on Sunday. Both her and Mr. Booker\u2019s approaches have a rich history in Democratic politics in Iowa.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesOn Sunday, Ms. Warren made only a glancing reference to unity, cautioning a voter who raised the idea of impeaching the president that the process would divide Americans and that, if it came to that, Democrats must \u201chelp pull this country together.\u201dCindy Garlock, a leader with the liberal activist group Indivisible Iowa who watched Ms. Warren on Sunday morning, said she had not picked a favorite but believed that Ms. Warren had a winning message. Ms. Garlock said she had also seen Mr. Booker during his visit but found Ms. Warren\u2019s presentation \u2014 dotted with plans to raise taxes on the wealthy and crack down on pharmaceutical and student-loan companies \u2014 more convincing.\u201cShe is a fighter, but I think that will also unite the country, if we\u2019re fighting for the right purpose,\u201d Ms. Garlock said. \u201cHer purpose is to help regular people who are going to work every day, trying to pay their bills, which is the majority of this country.\u201dBoth approaches have a rich history in Democratic politics, nationally and in Iowa \u2014 a state that has helped elevate conciliators like Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama to the presidency, while for decades sending prairie populists like Tom Harkin to Congress.Mr. Booker shares a clear political lineage with Mr. Obama, who captured the Iowa caucuses in 2008 with a message of national unity. But the party has also shifted left since then, and has grown more suspicious of Republicans who harried Mr. Obama and elected Mr. Trump. In 2016, Mr. Sanders nearly upset Hillary Clinton in Iowa as a populist insurgent.Mr. Trump\u2019s slashing style may also weigh on primary voters and caucusgoers, Democrats say, guaranteeing that even a kindhearted nominee would face a blizzard of personal attacks and crude trash-talking.Still, Representative Dave Loebsack, a veteran Democrat whose district covers Iowa\u2019s southeastern quadrant, said he believed that even partisan Iowans yearned for political reconciliation. Though he is neutral in the race, Mr. Loebsack predicted that Mr. Booker\u2019s uplifting narrative would resonate.\u201cI think we have to be careful with anger and outrage and alienation because that can also feed into the worst instincts of folks,\u201d Mr. Loebsack said, adding of Mr. Booker: \u201cI love his message of love and redemption and all the rest.\u201d"}, {"title": "\u2018A Woman, Just Not That Woman\u2019: How Sexism Plays Out on the Trail", "category": "Politics", "id": "b489ad66-acae-4e3b-8229-1c881372dff4", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/us/politics/sexism-double-standard-2020.html", "publishdate": 20190211, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/10/us/11doublestandards-slide-YD2Z/11doublestandards-slide-YD2Z-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "In the words of her detractors during the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton was abrasive and shrill. She was aloof. She was unlikable.It\u2019s not a coincidence that some of these adjectives are now bubbling up in discussions of Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris as they campaign for the 2020 Democratic nomination.Few Americans acknowledge they would hesitate to vote for a woman for president \u2014 but they don\u2019t have to, according to researchers and experts on politics and women and extensive research on double standards in campaigns. Reluctance to support female candidates is apparent in the language that voters frequently use to describe men and women running for office; in the qualities that voters say they seek; and in the perceived flaws that voters say they are willing or unwilling to overlook in candidates.[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]The influence and impact of these stereotypes and double standards are about to play out in uncharted territory: a presidential race featuring six women running for the Democratic nomination, all vying to compete against President Trump, who has a history of making sexist comments.\u201cFor 20 years, we\u2019ve heard participants in our focus groups say they would vote for a woman, just not that woman,\u201d said Amanda Hunter, research and communications director at the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which supports women in politics. \u201cThat promise will be put to the test in some cases, because folks may not be able to hide their bias behind that excuse when there\u2019s multiple women on the debate stage.\u201dSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is the latest woman to join the 2020 field, kicking off her campaign on Sunday. In the run-up to her announcement, she faced headlines about her well-known reputation in the Senate as a difficult boss. Whether she is held to a different standard than men remains to be seen: Male politicians pressure and berate staff members too, and, like Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s Senate office, President Trump has had high employee turnover.ImageSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota spoke to reporters in December about sexual harassment legislation.CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesHow much sexism ultimately influences votes is a matter of debate. In general elections, partisanship beats everything else, said Kathleen Dolan, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, whose research shows that most voters stick with their party\u2019s candidate regardless of gender.But there has been little comparable research on primaries, where partisanship isn\u2019t in the equation. And the Democrats will have a wide-open presidential primary in 2020 with multiple leading female candidates.What is not a matter of debate is the array of ways that sexism can manifest on the campaign trail, affecting not only how voters perceive candidates but how candidates present themselves to voters.The likability trapThe very first question of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s campaign was about her likability. \u201cA lot of people see you as pretty likable,\u201d a reporter told her. Did she consider that a \u201cselling point\u201d?Ms. Warren\u2019s evaluation arrived with similar speed, in a Politico article that asked how she could \u201cavoid a Clinton redux \u2014 written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground.\u201dOne of the most amorphous qualities candidates are judged on, likability is also deeply influenced by gender bias, researchers say. Voters look for it in men, too \u2014 consider the \u201cwho would you rather have a beer with\u201d question in campaigns \u2014 but only in women, research shows, do they consider it nonnegotiable.ImageSenator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York campaigned at a brewery in Iowa last month.CreditRachel Mummey for The New York Times\u201cWe know that voters will not support a woman that they do not like, even if they believe that she is qualified,\u201d Ms. Hunter said. \u201cBut they will vote for a man that they do not like if they believe he is qualified.\u201dIn 2016, for instance, both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump had poor favorability ratings; among voters who said they viewed both candidates negatively, Mr. Trump won by roughly 20 percentage points.Women also tend to be viewed as unlikable based on their ambition. Harvard researchers found in 2010 that voters regarded \u201cpower-seeking\u201d women with contempt and anger, but saw power-seeking men as stronger and more competent. There is often some implication of unscrupulousness in descriptions of female candidates as \u201cambitious\u201d \u2014 an adjective that could apply to any person running for president but is rarely used to disparage men. Within 24 hours of Ms. Harris\u2019s campaign kickoff, some critics were bringing up her onetime relationship with a powerful California politician, Willie Brown \u2014 a common tactic faced by women that sexualizes them and reduces their successes to a relationship with a man.And if a narrative of unlikability takes hold, it can influence voters without their even realizing it.\u201cI actually heard so often that people didn\u2019t like her and she was unlikable that I started to think, \u2018I don\u2019t know if I really like her so much,\u2019\u201d Heather Pasqualino Weirich, a Democrat from Phoenixville, Pa., said of Mrs. Clinton, whom she later supported. \u201cI realized I had no reason why I didn\u2019t like her.\u201dMasculinity and femininityThe qualities voters tend to expect from politicians \u2014 like strength, toughness and valor \u2014 are popularly associated with masculinity. This often means that from the moment a man steps onto the campaign trail, he benefits from a basic assumption that he is qualified to run, while a woman \u201chas to work twice as hard to show that she\u2019s qualified,\u201d Ms. Hunter said.\u201cPeople just start off assuming that you care about the soft issues, you care about hearth and home, and that you can\u2019t know anything about finance or military,\u201d said former Senator Carol Moseley Braun, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004.For many years, female candidates tried to adopt the characteristics voters wanted to see \u2014 to act, stereotypically speaking, like men. This worked for some but also brought pitfalls. For one thing, it did not challenge the premise that masculinity is better suited for leadership. It also opened women up to a familiar double standard: A man who speaks authoritatively might be confident or opinionated, while a woman who does the same is arrogant or lecturing. Most pressingly, it created a backlash among some voters who saw women acting \u201clike men\u201d and deemed them inauthentic.ImageSenator Kamala Harris of California held a news conference last month at her alma mater, Howard University, after announcing her candidacy for president.CreditTom Brenner for The New York TimesNichole M. Bauer, an assistant professor of political communication at Louisiana State University, found that when women played up stereotypically masculine qualities, voters \u2014 regardless of party \u2014 rated them better in terms of leadership ability, but voters in the opposing party rated them significantly lower in terms of likability. There was no similar backlash to male candidates who defied gender stereotypes.Dr. Bauer said that in all her research, she had found no way for women to win the support of voters in the opposing party. It\u2019s a basic psychological phenomenon, she said: If a Republican starts out disliking a Democratic woman, or vice versa, \u201cthey\u2019ll use gender stereotypes about women to maintain that perceived negative relationship\u201d no matter what the woman does.Superficial judgmentsPerhaps the most obvious way female candidates are judged differently is on their appearance: not only how \u201cattractive\u201d they are and how they dress, researchers say, but also their facial expressions, their body language and their voice. Accused in 2015 of \u201cshouting\u201d about gun violence, Mrs. Clinton responded: \u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m not shouting. It\u2019s just when women talk, some people think we\u2019re shouting.\u201dWomen are conscious that small elements of how they present themselves are subject to scrutiny. Representative Madeleine Dean \u2014 one of four Democratic women elected to the House last year from Pennsylvania, whose congressional delegation was previously all-male \u2014 said an aide would stand in the back of the room during her campaign events, holding up a cardboard sign with a smiley face to remind her to shift the serious expression she naturally wore while listening to voters.She was also coached, \u201cthough I did not take his coaching, not to cross my arms in front of myself because then you look mad,\u201d Ms. Dean said.These sorts of criticisms were common in the 2016 campaign, not only against Mrs. Clinton but also against Carly Fiorina, who ran in the Republican primary. \u201cLook at that face,\u201d Mr. Trump said at one point, openly mocking Ms. Fiorina\u2019s appearance. \u201cWould anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?\u201d (Mr. Trump subsequently claimed he had been talking about her persona. Ms. Fiorina, who did not respond to interview requests for this article, said at the time, \u201cI think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\u201d)Because these judgments are so superficial, and their gendered nature so obvious, they draw substantial backlash. But that doesn\u2019t mean they stop.\u201cThe women who run are still going to be, I think, more scrutinized about their appearance,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. \u201cI would love to think that they won\u2019t get the kind of comments that Hillary Clinton got about, \u2018Why is she yelling at me?\u2019 \u2018Why doesn\u2019t she smile more?\u2019 I\u2019d love to think that that\u2019s all gone now, but I don\u2019t believe that to be true.\u201dWho is a leader?History influences what voters see as normal. And for 230 years in the United States, presidential leadership has been male.For many decades, this was a self-sustaining cycle: Female candidates were outside the norm, so they didn\u2019t win, so they remained outside the norm. But the history of women\u2019s representation at other levels of government shows that the norm can shift.\u201cWhen we take a look at states that have had female governors, when voters see women succeed in executive office, it opens the door for more women in that role because it does literally change the face of leadership,\u201d Ms. Hunter, of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, said.Precisely because women running for president have lacked models for how to do it, what they are left with, Ms. Walsh said, is \u201cvery prescribed: \u2018Wear a little suit, talk about your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 but don\u2019t talk about your personal life, don\u2019t talk about your kids because then people are going to ask who\u2019s taking care of your kids.\u2019\u201dIn 2018, of course, many female candidates ran unabashedly as themselves, bucking the public images and political messages that women traditionally adhered to in campaigns. Some of them appeared with their young children; others proudly showed off their tattoos; and many talked in personal terms about discrimination and harassment as well as a range of policy issues.The presence of six women in the 2020 race, Ms. Walsh argued, is \u201cgoing to give women who run for office at every level more leeway, and a path to navigate that may be not quite so narrow.\u201d"}, {"title": "U.K. Economy Falters as Brexit Looms.

Last spring, worried that the United States was not keeping pace with China and other countries, Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary, sent a memo to the White House imploring the president to create a national strategy on A.I.Now, Mr. Trump has taken that step, though this \u201cAmerican A.I.

Initiative\u201d executive order on Monday.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesThe United States is engaged in an increasingly bitter trade war with China. And while American companies like Google and Amazon are now leaders in A.I., experts in the field are concerned that China could surpass the United States in the development of technologies that will power surveillance systems and autonomous weapons as well as driverless cars and a wide range of internet services.In July 2017, Chinese unveiled a plan to become the world leader in A.I., aiming to create an industry worth $150 billion to its economy by 2030, and two Chinese cities promised to invest $7 billion in the effort. Other governments, too, began making large investments, including South Korea, Britain, France and Canada.In the United States, the Defense Department has accelerated efforts to embrace A.I., shifting $75 million of its annual budget to a new office that will develop these technologies. Other government agencies also have major projects in the works. But many A.I. experts have worried that the top talent in the United States is moving to companies like Google and Amazon and away from government agencies.Last year, these concerns increased when Google pulled out of a project to build A.I for the Pentagon after employees protested that the technology they were working on could be used for lethal purposes. Companies like Google are also expanding their operations in countries like China, France and Canada, as the A.I. talent in those countries continues to expand.In a briefing with reporters on Sunday, a senior administration official said the White House would increase efforts to educate American workers in the field. The administration plans to work with the National Council for the American Worker to create educational efforts through industry and academia, and it will call on government agencies to develop fellowships related to A.I.The official did not provide specifics on how the United States will track the progress of these efforts."}, {"title": "Grammy Awards Show Stops Its Ratings Bleed", "category": "Business", "id": "6f2b4a74-805b-4895-b3bf-b9746d07c16e", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/business/media/grammy-awards-show-ratings-cbs.html", "publishdate": 20190211, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/10/fashion/10obama-grammys/merlin_150503424_61cb08bc-8684-4171-a3cc-5af29d0f4768-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Viewership for the Grammy Awards held steady on Sunday night, drawing an audience of 19.9 million people, according to Nielsen.That was slightly better than the 19.8 million viewers who tuned in for the show last year.

Alicia Keys hosted, and Michelle Obama made a cameo in the opening minutes of the ceremony.The viewership figures will also help stop the bleeding. The Grammys, which is generally the second-most-watched awards ceremony program, behind the Oscars, saw a 24 percent drop in viewers last year. Ratings declines have been the norm for awards shows in recent years, but the Grammys had proved mostly resilient.Despite the onstage star power, several big names did not show this year, including Kendrick Lamar, Childish Gambino and Ariana Grande.Sunday\u2019s total audience also keeps the Grammys within range of the Oscars.

Republicans wanted an exception to the cap for criminals; Democrats said a proposed 16,500-bed cap left more than enough room for them.What\u2019s at stake? The last shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, cost the American economy $11 billion and tanked President Trump\u2019s political standing with the public. Another shutdown could cause more economic harm, hitting the I.R.S. just as tax season starts.What\u2019s next? Lawmakers could pass another short-term spending bill, though many are reluctant to punt on a final budget agreement again. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is preparing to hold a rally for supporters in El Paso. (Many in the city aren\u2019t happy with that.) But he really has only two choices, according to Axios: shut down the government or declare a national emergency to get border wall money, and \u201cboth options are horrible.\u201dJeff Bezos is winning his National Enquirer fight, for nowThe Amazon founder risked embarrassment by going public with what he said was an extortion attempt by The National Enquirer. So far, he\u2019s scoring big points (\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d jokes aside).His disclosure has gotten results. Federal prosecutors are reviewing his extortion claim, the NYT reports, citing unnamed sources. If The Enquirer\u2019s parent company broke the law, it would be in violation of a nonprosecution agreement over its paying hush money to help President Trump in 2016. (A lawyer for the publisher\u2019s chairman said yesterday that the company committed no crime.)And he\u2019s winning the P.R. battle. At a time when billionaires are reviled, Maureen Dowd of the NYT writes, \u201cthe richest dude on earth has managed to come through a traumatic week inspiring admiration.\u201d (Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept counters that it would be odd for Mr. Bezos to gain pity, given that Amazon \u201cis a critical partner for the U.S. government in building an ever-more invasive, militarized and sprawling surveillance state.\u201d)Where did The Enquirer go wrong? Danny Westneat of The Seattle Times points out that it picked a fight with the head of a company so powerful that it got Seattle to change its tax policies and won $3 billion in tax incentives from New York for office space. \u201cYou don\u2019t pressure Amazon. It only goes the other way around,\u201d Mr. Westneat writes.But Mr. Bezos could still lose. Jon Swartz of Barron\u2019s notes that Amazon shares fell 2.6 percent on Friday. \u201cHis hands-on management is considered crucial to the success of the company and anything that pulls his attention away from day-to-day management is at least a concern for investors,\u201d Mr. Swartz writes.ImagePro-Brexit protesters in London last month.CreditTolga Akmen/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesCorporate America is worried about BrexitFears that Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. could roil economies have now officially spread across the Atlantic.Wall Street has been warned about Brexit\u2019s impact. \u201cWith less than seven weeks to go before the U.K. is due to leave the E.U., several S&P 500 groups have for the first time put Wall Street on formal notice of the risks should London and Brussels fail to reach a divorce deal,\u201d the FT reports. Companies like Lockheed Martin, McCormick, Expedia and Cadbury have all spoken out.Driving the concern are fears that a depressed pound could make American goods unaffordable in Britain, while the costs of imported British goods could rise. There\u2019s also a fear about the broader effect of Brexit on global political and economic stability.American banks are also nervous. \u201cWhile U.S. banks want Britain to maintain the closest possible ties with the EU after Brexit, U.K. banks and insurers are anxious they don\u2019t become beholden to new laws made by Brussels,\u201d Bloomberg reports.More Brexit news: The E.U.\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said that he \u201cwill not reopen\u201d the existing Brexit deal, but is open to reworking the political declaration that accompanies it. The British government is trying to secure an extra two weeks in which to win concessions from Europe by promising lawmakers another vote on Britain\u2019s withdrawal options. And Prime Minister Theresa May has also offered concessions to the opposing Labour Party to break the current impasse in Parliament.Tax refunds are down, despite Trump\u2019s overhaulAmericans are getting a rude surprise: Their refunds appear to be getting smaller, despite President Trump and Republicans passing a huge set of tax cuts over a year ago.How big is the drop? \u201cThe average refund of $1,865 was 8.4 percent smaller than the average refund in the period last year,\u201d Reuters reports, citing figures from the I.R.S. Heather Long of the WaPo adds that the number of people receiving a refund has fallen by nearly 25 percent so far. (The I.R.S. warns not to read too much into the figures, because this is just part of the data \u2014 a result of delayed processing due to the government shutdown.)Why is this happening? It\u2019s not actually a sign that Americans are paying more in taxes. \u201cPeople generally got a piece of their tax cut last year gradually in the form of lower withholding on their paychecks,\u201d Joseph Rosenberg of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center told the WaPo.People are angry nonetheless. The WaPo reports: \u201cPeople have already taken to social media, using the hashtag #GOPTaxScam, to vent their anger. Many blame President Trump and the Republicans for shrinking refunds. Some on Twitter even said they wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump again after seeing their refunds slashed.\u201dThe next unicorns are boring, and that\u2019s O.K.The last class of tech companies that gained valuations of over $1 billion, including Uber and Airbnb, remade entire industries. Don\u2019t expect the next wave to be nearly as flashy, according to Erin Griffith of the NYT.Who are they? They have names like Benchling, Checkr and Zola, and many create software for specific industries \u2014 including data analysis systems for farmers and background checks for gig workers.Why aren\u2019t they as exciting as their predecessors? Ms. Griffith points out that Uber, Airbnb and their peers \u201cbuilt global empires by simply taking existing businesses \u2014 like taxis, food delivery and hotels \u2014 and making them mobile.\u201d Easy opportunities to disrupt traditional businesses have dried up, forcing new companies to find smaller niches.But don\u2019t underestimate their potential. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not as sexy as the companies in the first wave,\u201d the venture capitalist Kirsten Green conceded to the NYT.

And now, just a couple months in, we\u2019re seeing one way that could take shape: sexism as a shield, fending off criticism that, on its surface, would seem nongendered.\u201cThe risk-benefit calculation by operatives has totally shifted because of this moment, and because of the alertness, particularly among women in the Democratic electorate, on this issue,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.For more than a decade, Hillary Clinton was the only model for how to deal with gender in a presidential race. Now, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss, coupled with the #MeToo Movement, has forced a national conversation about gender and power, priming Democratic primary voters to think differently about leadership and the barriers women face in politics.Part of what\u2019s happening is simply a reflection of something Americans have never seen before: Six different women using different campaign strategies to win the White House.It makes sense that a greater number of female candidates would provide more opportunities for sexist treatment. My colleague Maggie Astor has a terrific piece today explaining all the challenging and frequently implicit ways gender bias can manifest on the campaign trail.But, at the same time, for the first time in the history of presidential campaigns, gender is likely more of an advantage than it is a liability. That means it can be leveraged in ways we\u2019ve never before seen on a national stage.Even before Ms. Klobuchar formally entered the race, her aides were already telling reporters that accounts of her difficult management style played into sexist ideas about women and power. Aides and supporters of Senator Kamala Harris argue there is gender bias in the view that her past relationship with Willie Brown, a powerful California politician who was married when the two dated, could be a liability.So where does this leave the voters trying to sort through these claims of sexism? Jennifer L. Lawless, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, suggests a three-pronged test:1. Would the same allegations be leveled against a man?2. Do they only matter because she\u2019s a woman?3. Is the same criticism being leveled at multiple female candidates?By Dr. Lawless\u2019s assessment, the more serious problem for Ms. Klobuchar isn\u2019t that the stories about her bad treatment of her staff tap into sexist tropes \u2014 it\u2019s that they conflict with her \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d public persona.Now, having the very first question Ms. Gillibrand face as a candidate be about her \u201clikability\u201d? That\u2019s sexist. But, Dr. Lawless says, making fun of her fried chicken cluelessness is just another manifestation of a political rule as old as photography: Never eat ugly.ImageCreditAssociated PressImageCreditJacqueline Larma/Associated PressJust ask Gerald Ford (tamale with wrapper), John Kerry (Swiss cheese on cheesesteak), or that photo of Michael Bloomberg and pizza we highlighted just a couple weeks ago.____________________Drop us a line!ImageWe want to hear from our readers.

Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com.____________________Sixty-Second Guide to \u2026 H.R. 1ImageWe were curious to know more about H.R. 1, a voting and ethics bill making waves in Congress. So we asked Catie Edmondson, who covers Capitol Hill for The Times, to break it down for us:The first major piece of legislation House Democrats unveiled in their new majority is an ambitious, 600-page bill that reads like an anthology of liberal anti-corruption proposals. Intended to show voters that they are following through on their campaign pledges, the bill, called H.R. 1, has three overarching goals: to dismantle barriers to the ballot box, end big money in politics, and impose stricter ethics rules on government officials.It also, unsurprisingly, takes a few jabs at the president.The bill is so sprawling that even the SparkNotes version put out by its lead sponsor, Representative John Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, is a whopping 22 pages, divided into sections including \u201cVoting,\u201d \u201cCampaign Finance,\u201d and \u201cEthics.\u201d Here are a few of the highlights.H.R. 1 would:\u2022 Automatically register citizens to vote.\u2022 Require states to allow voters to register on the day of a federal election.\u2022 Make Election Day a federal employment holiday.\u2022 Require presidents and candidates for the nation\u2019s highest offices to release their tax returns.\u2022 Create a matching system for small donations to campaigns.\u2022 Ban campaign contributions from corporations with significant foreign ownership.Opposing the bill has become a pet interest of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader. (He has dubbed it \u201cthe Democrat Politician Protection Act\u201d and mused publicly that much of it is \u201cprobably\u201d unconstitutional.) So it faces dim prospects in the Senate, making H.R. 1, as one of my colleagues put it, less a legislative vehicle than a political platform for the Democrats heading into 2020.Even if little, or none, of it becomes law, Democrats will use it to draw a stark contrast between their values and the president\u2019s \u2014 and to drive a wedge between the occupant in the Oval Office and voters.[Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox.]____________________What to read tonight\u2022 A former Miss Costa Rica says a former president and Nobel laureate attacked her.

One of the principal designers of Central Park in New York, he took pains to replicate the gentle beauty he saw in European parks that blended trees and shrubs, streams and bridges. \u201cThe park throughout is a single work of art,\u201d he wrote. That pastoral artistry can be fleeting in a large metropolis. The relationship between humans and nature improves mental health and promotes prosocial behavior. But as cities grow, green space is squeezed out. Community leaders are finding ways to restore some of the balance. The opening of the High Line in Manhattan in 2009 brought national attention to the idea of reclaiming underused space for parks. Its success led to the development of a network of projects across the country, including an elevated park in Philadelphia, a deck spanning a freeway in Dallas and a multiuse trail around downtown Atlanta. Rail Park in PhiladelphiaPhotographs by Michelle GustafsonImageAn elevated viaduct a quarter-mile long, the first section of the Rail Park in Philadelphia offers a peek of what\u2019s planned. The project will eventually transform three miles of rail lines used by the now-defunct Reading Railroad. Visitors can relax on large wooden platforms and bench swings. The pathway meanders through an area once home to shuttered factories; eventually, it will connect 10 neighborhoods in the city. The Rail Park is part of the High Line Network, a collaborative group of 19 reclamation projects across North America that was announced in 2017 after the success of the High Line. Project organizers share information to help communities transform obsolete infrastructure into public parks.

The park has created more than $2 billion in economic development, according to the foundation that runs it, and has increased property values in the area. The foundation recently announced a $76 million expansion that will add 1.2 acres and include a 20,000-square-foot pavilion with a visitor center.

Both parties already view Arizona as a swing state in the presidential race and in 2018 Democrats won a Senate race there for the first time in decades.Ms. McSally, an Air Force veteran, was narrowly defeated in a statewide race last year by Senator Kyrsten Sinema. Ms. McSally joined the Senate anyway a few months later, appointed to fill the vacancy left by John McCain\u2019s death after a placeholder appointee, Jon Kyl, resigned.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Mr. Kelly, 54, unveiled his campaign in an online video highlighting his experience as an astronaut and Navy pilot. Ms. Giffords, a former member of Congress who was shot and nearly killed by a deranged gunman in 2011, appeared beside him in the message.Ms. Giffords was seen as a likely future Senate candidate before the shooting, and the video casts Mr. Kelly as carrying forward her legacy. For several years, the two have led a national gun-control group that played a significant role in the midterm elections.Narrating the video, Mr. Kelly presented himself as a non-politician and a unifying figure, focused on issues like health care, wage stagnation and climate change. That approach echoes the avowedly moderate course Ms. Sinema charted in her campaign last year, when she successfully assembled a coalition of young people, Latinos and centrist whites opposed to President Trump.\u201cSolving some of the hardest problems requires one thing, and that\u2019s teamwork,\u201d Mr. Kelly said in the video. \u201cPartisanship and polarization and gerrymandering and corporate money have ruined our politics, and it\u2019s divided us.\u201dMr. Kelly lamented a \u201cretreat from science and data and facts\u201d that he said prevents problems from getting solved.

At least one other prominent Democrat, Representative Ruben Gallego, has been exploring the race. He could present a challenge to Mr. Kelly on the left.Mr. Gallego said on Tuesday morning that he was still considering the race, indicating he would not make way for Mr. Kelly.\u201cI\u2019ve made no secret of the fact that I\u2019m looking seriously at running for the U.S. Senate in 2020, and that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Mr. Gallego said on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019ll be making a final decision and announcement soon.\u201dMs. McSally is also likely to face pressure from her party\u2019s activist flank. In 2018, she shifted well to the right to navigate a Republican primary, aligning herself closely with Mr. Trump in a way that ultimately harmed her in the general election.The Arizona race is one of a handful that will decide control of the Senate in 2020. Republicans have a 53-seat majority in the chamber, meaning that Democrats need to gain three or four seats to take power, depending on which party holds the vice presidency.The two parties are also aggressively targeting Republican-held Senate seats in Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Colorado and North Carolina, and a Democratic-held seat in Alabama, among others.Mr. Kelly has been among the most closely watched potential Democratic candidates, along with Stacey Abrams in Georgia."}, {"title": "Washington Post Finds Itself in the Middle of the Jeff Bezos Story", "category": "Business", "id": "5fa2da69-1271-4cf5-a295-6e0b181976cf", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/business/media/washington-post-jeff-bezos.html", "publishdate": 20190212, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/12/business/12WAPO-promo/merlin_150371214_916e558a-7675-4ff6-9b68-2e8fb91decfb-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Jeff Bezos says owning The Washington Post is a \u201ccomplexifier\u201d for him. The newspaper could say the same about him.The paper has flourished under Mr. Bezos\u2019 ownership. Since he bought the newspaper in 2013 for $250 million, The Post has added over 200 people to its newsroom, which now numbers 900 journalists, and won plaudits and awards for its coverage of, among other subjects, the Trump administration. The paper has more than 1.5 million digital subscribers, and the business has been profitable for the past three years.But the newsroom entered tricky editorial terrain last week when it became a factor in an apparent extortion attempt against Mr. Bezos, while also having to independently cover the events around its owner.The drama featured a litany of classic tabloid elements that would challenge any newsroom \u2014 a marriage-busting affair documented by The National Enquirer, Hollywood agents with ties to political figures, secret rendezvous at high-end hotels and sexting \u2014 let alone one whose owner sits at the center of the controversy.It was also a stark reminder that Mr. Bezos is a very public figure of great wealth and influence. He is the world\u2019s richest person by dint of his command of Amazon, a company that is reaching further and further into the lives of everyday people, whether through its e-commerce business, its entertainment properties or its numerous warehouses around the country that employ hundreds of thousands.His personal project, Blue Origin, describes its mission as \u201cbuilding a road to space so our children can build the future.\u201dWith his blog post detailing his extortion allegations last week, Mr. Bezos has now also become a prominent commentator on the First Amendment. He said he was fighting back against alleged tactics that have no business in journalism, while The Enquirer claims he is merely trying to muzzle a publication because its coverage embarrassed him.The editorial page of The Post clearly sides with its owner. On Friday, the day after Mr. Bezos published his blog post, the paper published an editorial praising him for exposing an \u201cinsidious model of intimidation and corruption masquerading as journalism.\u201dThe overall situation will \u201ctest both Marty Baron and Jeff Bezos,\u201d Kyle Pope, the editor and publisher of The Columbia Journalism Review, said in an email, referring to The Post\u2019s executive editor. Mr. Bezos gets \u201cgood marks so far,\u201d Mr. Pope said, but \u201cthe truth is that the rules of journalism are not baked into his bones; it\u2019s something he\u2019s going to have to learn, at a very stressful and trying time.\u201dMr. Bezos did not respond to a request for comment.The Washington Post declined to make Mr. Baron available for an interview but the paper did provide a statement from him.\u201cJeff has never gotten involved in our reporting or our final stories,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople surmise that it must be difficult to cover Jeff and Amazon. But we\u2019ve gone five and a half years with his ownership, and he hasn\u2019t once intervened in any way.\u201dThe clash between Mr. Bezos and The Enquirer began last month when the tabloid published an expos\u00e9 of his extramarital affair with the television personality Lauren Sanchez. Mr. Bezos fought back in his remarkably revealing blog post on Medium, the online open platform. He accused David J. Pecker, the chairman of The Enquirer\u2019s parent company, American Media Inc., of threatening through intermediaries to publish graphic photographs of Mr. Bezos if he did not publicly announce that The Enquirer\u2019s reporting on his affair was not politically motivated.The Post has traditionally focused on the nation\u2019s capital, with not as many resources devoted to business coverage. That has started to change. The Post had previously said it would nearly double the number of journalists devoted to covering Silicon Valley to 25, including a reporter in Seattle who will focus on Amazon.It also aggressively followed up on the revelation about Mr. Bezos\u2019 private life.The Post published a lengthy article on Feb. 5 about The Enquirer\u2019s coverage of Mr. Bezos\u2019 affair. It quoted Gavin de Becker, his longtime security chief, as saying the leak of evidence of Mr. Bezos\u2019 infidelity to The Enquirer was \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d designed to embarrass Mr. Bezos because he owns The Post. Mr. de Becker added that the effort could also involve figures from President Trump\u2019s campaign.Emails from American Media that Mr. Bezos included in his blog post referred to the Post article and demanded that he \u2014 and the newspaper \u2014 refrain from any statements or suggestions that politics played any part in its coverage of his affair with Ms. Sanchez.Like other newspapers, including The New York Times, The Post ran front-page articles on Mr. Bezos and American Media on Friday and Saturday. Those were not the only articles about his interests. The paper also published a report about Amazon\u2019s potentially pulling out of its agreement to build a headquarters in New York City, as well as one about a lawsuit filed against Amazon by the director Woody Allen, who said its streaming service had improperly backed out of a four-movie deal with him.\u201cI think they\u2019ve finally woken up to the fact that their owner is a huge story,\u201d said Mr. Pope, who has criticized the paper\u2019s past coverage of Amazon as anemic. With the fight between Mr. Bezos and American Media, he said, \u201cthey\u2019ve moved into an appropriately higher gear.\u201dMr. Baron said the paper had not changed its approach to its coverage of Mr. Bezos or his business interests. Mr. Baron has said that he, along with other executives, talks with Mr. Bezos about \u201cstrategy\u201d every two weeks or so, but that the discussions do not touch on the paper\u2019s coverage. Mr. Bezos owns The Post separately from Amazon.\u201cBecause I know full well that he won\u2019t interfere, it\u2019s not really difficult to cover him and Amazon at all,\u201d Mr. Baron said in his statement. \u201cIn all the years of his ownership, there hasn\u2019t been one report of his exerting influence, explicitly or implicitly, on our coverage.\u201dFrederick J. Ryan Jr., the publisher and chief executive of The Post, echoed those sentiments in a statement, and said Mr. Bezos had played no part in the editorial that praised his blog post.\u201cJeff has always made it clear that he expects The Washington Post will act with complete independence, both in our news coverage and editorials, and treat him and his companies just as we would anyone else,\u201d Mr. Ryan wrote. \u201cWe have never wavered from that position.\u201dDonald Graham, whose family had owned The Post for almost 80 years before he sold it to Mr. Bezos, said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the editorial. \u201cI agree with every word of it,\" he said in an email.He added, \u201cHad they not editorialized, perhaps The Times would be doing a piece about the absence of such an editorial and what did that mean?\u201dBill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor and a former editor at The Wall Street Journal, said it should have been made clearer to readers that Mr. Bezos had nothing to do with the editorial.\u201cReaders deserve to know whether Bezos knew about the editorial in advance, or in any way contributed to discussions that led to it,\u201d he said.To show that the newspaper remains independent of its owner, The Post pointed to another editorial, from early last year. That editorial warned that cities should \u201cproceed with caution, with their eyes at least as wide open as their wallets,\u201d when bidding to be a location for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.That has now become a major hometown story.

But on Tuesday they took an unexpected turn for the better.Officials in Berlin agreed to help finance a port to import liquefied natural gas from America, a key United States demand.In return, the United States government is toning down its opposition to an underwater pipeline being built to Germany from Russia.The unofficial agreement, announced in Berlin by high-ranking American and German officials, was a rare case of rapprochement in a relationship that has been severely strained by American tariffs on European steel, continued threats to impose levies on German cars and personal enmity between Mr. Trump and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor.Germany\u2019s gas supply had become a major point of contention. Last year, officials in Brussels promised to buy more American natural gas as a way of answering complaints by the Trump administration that trans-Atlantic trade favors Europe.At the same time, though, Germany continued to support construction of a pipeline under the Baltic Sea that would deliver gas from Russia. The project annoyed the United States as well as European countries like Poland, Slovakia and the Baltic states.Both the United States and Germany made concessions Tuesday, an unusual occurrence in the recent history of trans-Atlantic relations.Peter Altmaier, the German minister for the economy and energy, said the government would support construction of at least one terminal, probably in the vicinity of Hamburg, for offloading liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., from special tankers. While the gas could come from anywhere, the project is seen as a way to open Germany to gas producers in Texas and other states.Dan Brouillette, the United States deputy secretary of energy, said he was encouraged by Germany\u2019s plans, although he did not specifically promise that the United States would stop trying to interfere with the pipeline from Russia, known as Nord Stream 2.\u201cWe will be watching this very closely,\u201d he said.The pipeline is fraught with geopolitical significance. United States officials had gone so far as to threaten sanctions against the companies building it, saying it would make Germany even more dependent on Russian energy. Countries including France and Poland shared American concerns.\u201cIt is important to send the signal that we are ready to make progress; we are ready to cooperate,\u201d Mr. Altmaier said during an appearance with Mr. Brouillette at a conference that included representatives of German industry.Both men said there was no formal deal, but they exuded relief that at least one point of conflict had been eased.Analysts say a terminal for liquefied natural gas on Germany\u2019s northern shore, where the port would be built, is probably superfluous. Terminals in Belgium, the Netherlands and Poland can pump gas into Germany\u2019s network and are operating far below capacity. And gas transported in tankers is likely to be much more expensive than gas sent by pipeline from Russia.\u201cIf the Germans want to import L.N.G., the obvious way to do it is by the Belgian terminal or the Dutch terminal \u2014 not to build their own terminal,\u201d said Jonathan Stern, distinguished research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. \u201cBut this is how politics intruded on the situation.\u201dThe Germans are eager to prevent the Trump administration from following through on threats to impose tariffs on imported Mercedes, Porsche, BMW and Audi vehicles. The Commerce Department is expected to submit a report within days that would establish a legal basis for doing so.By taking steps to import more gas, the Germans are addressing Mr. Trump\u2019s complaints that Germany sells more goods to the United States than it imports.Many details of the gas infrastructure remain unresolved, including precisely where it would be built and how much money the government would provide.\u201cWe are talking about substantial but reasonable sums that will contribute to Germany becoming one of the 50 countries that will have L.N.G. terminals,\u201d Mr. Altmaier said.It will be at least two years and perhaps longer before any terminals begin operating, and they face energetic opposition from environmental groups, which argue that liquefied natural gas is inefficient because of the energy required to liquefy the gas, transport it in ships and convert it back to gas.Gas imported from America faces especially stiff opposition because it is associated with the technique known as fracking, which some groups blame for environmental damage like water pollution.Mr. Brouillette said having more liquefied natural gas terminals would promote competition and help drive down the price. Gas is an increasingly important energy source in Germany, which plans to shut down the last of its nuclear power plants by 2022 and quit burning coal within the next two decades.\u201cWe think these terminals provide not only diversity but competition to pipeline gas throughout Europe,\u201d Mr. Brouillette said. \u201cSo we are encouraged by the actions that were taken most recently by the minister and the German government with regard to those terminals.\u201dThe Nord Stream pipeline has also been a source of tension within Europe. Countries including Poland and France have expressed fear that Russia could use gas as a diplomatic cudgel.Last week, representatives of European Union nations defused a potential conflict between France and Germany by agreeing to a compromise proposal on oversight of Nord Stream 2. New rules would give Brussels more power to regulate the pipeline, while allowing Germany to continue leading negotiations with Russia.Mr. Brouillette said that the United States would be watching closely to see how the compromise took effect. \u201cBut,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cI must say that, on balance, we are encouraged by this.\u201d"}, {"title": "\u2018Not All Fun and Memes\u2019: BuzzFeed News Employees Plan to Form a Union", "category": "Business", "id": "35acff7a-7f82-4de3-a847-c13a0aa8f0e6", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/business/buzzfeed-news-union-layoffs.html", "publishdate": 20190212, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/business/14BUZZFEED-01/merlin_148026411_0d577668-fdba-4062-914e-997e4b76bc47-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Last month, BuzzFeed laid off more than 220 employees, or 15 percent of its work force.

In an email to the staff before the firings, Mr. Peretti wrote, \u201cUnfortunately, revenue growth by itself isn\u2019t enough to be successful in the long run.\u201dMurmurs of a union started among company employees in 2015, when a group of staff members met with the NewsGuild of New York to discuss the issue of pay disparity, particularly in regards to women and employees of color. The group continued the effort last fall, when more than 50 employees participated in a meeting at the NewsGuild office.The job losses have further motivated the organizers, according to Dominic Holden, a politics reporter at BuzzFeed News and a member of the organizing committee. Davey Alba, a senior technology reporter, said, by her own estimation, \u201cabout 90 percent\u201d of eligible BuzzFeed employees supported the idea.A BuzzFeed spokesman did not immediately comment on the organizing effort.

Days after the layoff, roughly 600 current and former employees signed an open letter posted on Medium that pushed Mr. Peretti and other executives to compensate the laid-off staff members for unused vacation and comp days as part of their exit packages.It worked. Hours after the letter was published, Mr. Peretti notified the staff that he would grant the request.So far, the union effort involves only employees at BuzzFeed News, the division of the company led by the editor Ben Smith.If the company recognizes the union, a certification with the NewsGuild would follow, along with a negotiation of who would be covered under any contract.If BuzzFeed doesn\u2019t recognize the union, the organizers said they would hold a union election with an official from the National Labor Relations Board present to facilitate a secret ballot.\u201cI am confident in management,\u201d Ms. Alba said. \u201cI think that they will voluntarily recognize it.\u201dWorkers at BuzzFeed News are the latest digital media employees to pursue a union effort. So far this year, Vice Media, affiliated with the Writers Guild of America, East, has expanded the number of employees counted as union members, and employees at Refinery29 organized a union, also under the Writers Guild banner.Last year, employees at The New Yorker and New York magazine formed unions with the NewsGuild of New York. In both cases, management voluntarily recognized the organizing efforts.According to a report in the Harvard Business Review, 30 digital news sites and newspapers have recognized unions since 2015. \u201cIn total, the number of unionized workers in internet publishing has risen 20-fold since 2010,\u201d the report said.Mr. Peretti is on the record opposing the idea. In 2015, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think a union is right for BuzzFeed.\u201dIn an interview with The New York Times in November, Mr. Peretti floated a solution to the volatile economic landscape now affecting digital media companies: a series of mergers among the top internet publishers, including Vice, Vox Media, Group Nine Media and Refinery29. Mr. Peretti reasoned that, if BuzzFeed and those companies were to unite, they would put themselves in a better position to negotiate favorable terms with powerful tech platforms like Facebook.\u201cHe clearly understands the value of collective bargaining,\u201d Mr. Holden said. \u201cAnd we agree with him that collective action is critical to securing an equitable agreement.\u201d"}, {"title": "Recent Commercial Real Estate Transactions", "category": "Business", "id": "d51b4eb6-368f-49e1-875d-843284460d8c", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/realestate/commercial/new-york-commercial-real-estate.html", "publishdate": 20190212, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/02/realestate/commercial/02transFor-Sale/02transFor-Sale--articleLarge.jpg", "content": "FOR SALE$14.975 MILLION127 East 69th Street (between Park and Lexington Avenues)ManhattanThis 22-foot-wide five-story mixed-use townhouse, built in 1872 as one of 11 single-family rowhouses, is available in the Lenox Hill section of the Upper East Side Historic District.

Most corporate executives have avoided weighing in at all.And there is no sign that the furor is scaring off investment: Amazon is reportedly wavering in its commitment to open a complex for thousands of workers in New York, where the internet giant has faced opposition, but it has sent no signals about backing out of expansion plans in Northern Virginia.\u201cI\u2019d be very surprised to see business leaders and C.E.O.s weigh in on impeachment proceedings or calls to resign,\u201d said Aaron Chatterji, a Duke University professor who has studied executives\u2019 political interventions. \u201cIt\u2019s more seen as an internal Virginia decision.\u201dThat reaction stands in contrast to what happened when North Carolina passed a law in 2016 that was widely criticized as discriminating against transgender people. In that case, companies including PayPal and CoStar, a real estate research firm, canceled planned projects in the state, the National Collegiate Athletic Association refused to hold events there, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other groups organized economic boycotts.Business and consumer groups deployed similar tactics in recent years to fight a \u201creligious freedom\u201d law in Indiana that critics said could be used to discriminate against gay couples and an Arizona law that cracked down on unauthorized immigrants. Such organizations also successfully pushed South Carolina to remove the Confederate flag from the grounds of its statehouse.Those cases, however, involved state laws or policies that affected companies\u2019 customers and employees. Virginia\u2019s struggle involves individual behavior \u2014 albeit the behavior of three top elected officials. Gov. Ralph Northam has admitted darkening his face with shoe polish to impersonate Michael Jackson in the 1980s. Attorney General Mark Herring said he, too, had worn blackface as a college student. And Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax has been accused by two women of sexual assault, charges he denies.Derrick Johnson, president of the N.A.A.C.P., said there was a \u201chuge distinction\u201d between the issues in Virginia and those in other states. He has called on Mr. Northam to resign, but the organization hasn\u2019t urged members to avoid the state or to punish businesses based there.\u201cIndividual acts, the response to that should be individual accountability,\u201d he said. \u201cState actions, the response there is in fact state accountability.\u201dMr. Johnson wouldn\u2019t rule out a boycott in the future if Mr. Northam stayed in office. If such a boycott developed, or if businesses in the state began to struggle financially, it could increase pressure on Mr. Northam and Mr. Fairfax to resign, and on legislators to remove them. A 2017 study found that local politicians were more likely to support removing Confederate flags from public spaces when the issue was framed as an economic concern.Analysts said there was little reason to expect the political disarray to derail a strong state economy. Virginia came through the recession better than most states, in part because it benefited more than other places from federal stimulus spending during the downturn, and now boasts one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, at 2.8 percent in December. In some Washington suburbs in the northern part of the state, the unemployment rate is below 2 percent.The state has a triple-A bond rating, a history of fiscal responsibility and a longstanding reputation for business friendliness.\u201cThey\u2019ve done a very good job of managing their fiscal affairs, and that\u2019s been true across both Democratic and Republican governments for a while now,\u201d said Eric Kim, who analyzes the state\u2019s finances for Fitch, the bond ratings agency.Mr. Kim noted that past controversies involving governors had not affected state economies or bond ratings. Missouri, for example, didn\u2019t suffer economically when Eric Greitens faced a series of sex and campaign-finance scandals that led to his resignation. Even the uproar over the North Carolina \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d though it cost business, had only a modest economic impact on the state.\u201cState governments, even if there\u2019s a controversy or turnover at the highest level, the machinery of state government continues to function,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cTax revenue continues to come in, and states continue to operate.\u201dSure enough, Mr. Northam last week signed a bill promising tax incentives to Amazon for its planned campus in the state. He did so in private, without the public ceremony and photo opportunity that often accompany such actions. But it was nonetheless a sign that the leadership crisis hasn\u2019t derailed the basic operations of state government.Tom Stringer, head of site selection for the consulting firm BDO, said that he wasn\u2019t surprised to see the Amazon deal still moving forward, and that the turmoil was unlikely to cause companies to avoid the state. Virginia, he noted, limits governors to a single four-year term, meaning businesses are used to turnover in the executive branch. Investment decisions are based on a longer time frame, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t think this will really have an effect,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cFrom a business development standpoint, this really seems like an anomaly.\u201dStill, the episode could have longer-run implications. Virginia in recent years has worked to move past its history as the capital of the Confederacy and to promote its young, educated and diverse work force. The deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in 2017 was an unwelcome reminder of the state\u2019s history. The recent controversy is a further setback, said Ravi Perry, chairman of the political science department at Virginia Commonwealth University.\u201cAll of this drama distracts from the multiple other kinds of success that we can point to,\u201d Mr. Perry said. \u201cThere\u2019s always an economic effect when states have negative political news that is longstanding.\u201dGregory B. Fairchild, a professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s business school, said both the violence in Charlottesville and the current upheaval could give some young people pause about moving to the state. In theory, that could affect companies\u2019 decisions as well, particularly at a time when employers are struggling to find talented workers. But he doubted that the scandals would have a measurable effect on Virginia\u2019s economy.\u201cIf someone were really thinking about moving to the state of Virginia, I\u2019m not sure that this is the thing that causes them not to move,\u201d Mr. Fairchild said."}, {"title": "\u2018This Is My Space\u2019: Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s Unabashedly Feminist Campaign", "category": "Politics", "id": "84c0e507-d687-4303-9139-d32626e50c5c", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-president-feminist.html", "publishdate": 20190212, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/us/politics/14gillibrand-2-print/merlin_140458323_02b0b153-752e-4b84-963e-9766c1e44bd9-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The morning after the election of Donald J.

And almost two years to the day after that, Ms. Gillibrand sat in a Manhattan wine bar, holding a glass of pinot noir, and described why she believes the country and the Democratic Party need an unabashedly feminist campaign for president \u2014 and why she thinks she\u2019s the candidate to run it.\u201cYou understand, this is my space,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said, in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know if my party will get as far as I will go on a lot of these issues. But I believe in them so strongly.\u201dAt a moment when women are ascendant in Democratic politics and polls show a record gender gap between the parties, Ms. Gillibrand and her advisers see an opportunity to ride a wave of women\u2019s political energy right into the White House. While multiple women are serious contenders for president for the first time in American history, Ms. Gillibrand is the only one who is making running as a woman, for women, the central theme of her candidacy.Whether her campaign is successful or not, Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s approach will test how much views have changed on issues like discrimination, sexual harassment and female leadership, after two years of an administration that has embroiled the country in an emotional debate over gender bias.VideoSenator Kirsten Gillibrand announced in January that she\u2019s running for president in 2020. But since then, she has struggled to raise money and gain traction in what has become a crowded Democratic primary. Here\u2019s what you need to know about her.CreditCreditScott Kowalchyk/CBSMs. Gillibrand says advocating for women has been the cause of her political life, from her days as a young lawyer raising money for women\u2019s charities. But she is choosing the mantle of feminist crusader at a time when other core Democratic issues are more problematic for her.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]As a House member from upstate New York earlier in her political career, she held far more conservative positions on gun control and immigration. Her years as a corporate lawyer, taking clients that included a big tobacco company, and her past as a voracious fund-raiser from Wall Street donors complicate her ability to attack greed and inequality in big business.And by using her gender to find a toehold in the Democratic electorate, Ms. Gillibrand risks pigeonholing herself in a race where voters may be seeking a broader populist message.\u201cThere may well be a risk,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said, in what she calls her \u201cwomen plus\u201d campaign platform. \u201cBut it is who I am. I think the country would be so much stronger if women had greater voices.\u201dStill, Ms. Gillibrand is unwavering. Calling out sexism and sexual misconduct in all corners \u2014 including her outspoken critiques of former President Bill Clinton and former Senator Al Franken \u2014 is a political calling card that she feels distinguishes her.ImageMs. Gillibrand at a protest over the Trump administration\u2019s family detention policies in Washington in June.CreditErin Schaff for The New York TimesHer first words on national television describing her rationale for running were that she is a \u201cyoung mom.\u201d Her first big speech as a candidate took place at a women\u2019s march in Des Moines.

In 2013, she delivered a speech laying out her economic plan aimed at promoting women in the work force that included proposals for equal pay, paid leave, affordable child care, universal pre-K and raising the minimum wage.In the Senate, some of her biggest fights have been around securing greater protections for women facing sexual assault cases in the military, on college campuses and on Capitol Hill.Ms. Gillibrand has also shown a willingness to buck powerful men in her own party.In 2017, she made headlines by saying Mr. Clinton\u2019s sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky should have prompted him to resign, angering the Clintons, who had championed her early in her career.Ms. Gillibrand is also still navigating the fallout from another controversial choice within her own party: her decision in late 2017 to become the first Democratic senator to call for the resignation of Mr. Franken, following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. Despite the backlash she has faced from some Democratic quarters, Ms. Gillibrand said she saved the party from itself, arguing that standing by Mr. Franken would have cost Democrats congressional seats in the midterms.And she said Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, would not have won his special election in Alabama if Mr. Franken had not stepped aside and provided the party with a clear message against the Republican, Roy S. Moore, a state jurist accused of sexually assaulting teenage girls.ImageIn 2017, Ms. Gillibrand became the first senator to call for Al Franken to resign following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.CreditAl Drago for The New York Times\u201cGod bless him if he wanted to sue every woman who made an allegation against him,\u2019\u2019 she said of Mr. Franken. \u201cBut just imagine this last election how many women came out to vote and ran for office, and young women. Would they have felt that nobody had their back?\u2019\u2019Her advisers argue that the incident shows Ms. Gillibrand as a fighter unafraid to take on powerful men, and that the intense energy of women in the Democratic Party will outweigh the concerns. Her campaign distributed a memo as she entered the race saying that 58 percent of Democratic presidential primary voters in 2016 were women, and that female candidates won nearly two-thirds of open House Democratic primaries in 2018.\u201cLooking at 2018, there was something in the water she will tap into because it\u2019s authentic to her,\u201d said Glen Caplin, a top adviser to Ms. Gillibrand.It\u2019s a strategy neither Senator Elizabeth Warren nor Senator Kamala Harris have embraced in their presidential platforms. During her campaign rollout last month, Ms. Harris focused heavily on her connections with the black community and her career as a prosecutor. Ms. Warren has centered her argument around class, rather than gender, making her personal story of economic struggle the centerpiece of her pitch to voters.\u201cUltimately, that\u2019s why I decided to run,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Gillibrand said. \u201cBecause I was concerned maybe the rest of the team doesn\u2019t focus on these issues. Maybe the rest of the team doesn\u2019t get where they need to go.\u2019\u2019ImageMs. Gillibrand and her advisers see an opportunity to ride a wave of women\u2019s political energy into the White House.CreditRachel Mummey for The New York TimesAnd while Ms. Gillibrand denounced questions of \u201clikability\u201d as sexist, Ms. Warren explicitly demurred from such labels in an interview last month.Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s bluntness worries some Democrats in early voting states, who fear a repeat of the kind of sexism they believe sank Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign in 2016.Linda Smoley, who hosted Mrs. Clinton at her Sioux City, Iowa, home in 2015 and attended Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s first house party in Iowa in January, said she was so distressed after Mr. Trump was elected that she got anti-depressants from her doctor and then accidentally drove her car into her house.Ms. Gillibrand had reached out moments earlier about appearing at Ms. Smoley\u2019s local women\u2019s group, Siouxland Progressive Women. But after the trauma of 2016, Ms. Smoley at first voiced reservations about selecting another female nominee.\u201cMy only concern is that she is a woman,\u201d Ms. Smoley said, \u201cand I fear that in this misogynistic society in which we live, I think it will be hard for a woman because there are so many middle-aged and older white men who don\u2019t want to cede power.\u201dBut moments later, she was reconsidering, gingerly.\u201cBut maybe we have turned,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cMaybe this time, if she can convince those white women Trump voters how we as Democrats could make lives better, maybe she could get some of that vote that Hillary lost.\u201d"}, {"title": "The Government Shutdown Made the I.R.S.

In the week that ended Feb. 2, shortly after agency employees returned to their jobs, fewer than half of the calls to the I.R.S.\u2019s accounts-management lines were answered, compared with nearly 90 percent during the same week last year. The typical hold time for such callers increased to 17 minutes from four minutes in 2018.There were similar frustrations for those who called the agency\u2019s so-called balance-due line in hopes of making payment arrangements for taxes they owed. Fewer than 7 percent of such calls were answered, and the typical wait for those that were stretched to more than 80 minutes.I.R.S. officials said they were reviewing the taxpayer advocate\u2019s findings.\u201cWe are continuing to assess the impact of the shutdown on our various operations across the agency and remain proud of the many I.R.S. employees who have risen to the resulting challenges,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cThe I.R.S. is committed to continue making improvements across our information technology, tax enforcement and taxpayer service operations.\u201dData released by the agency last week showed that Americans had filed 12 percent fewer returns through Feb. 2, compared with the same point in 2018, and that the I.R.S. had processed 26 percent fewer returns. The agency has given no indication \u2014 in Tuesday\u2019s statement or otherwise \u2014 that it might consider pushing back April\u2019s tax filing deadline in order to account for shutdown-related snags.The taxpayer advocate\u2019s audit did not focus solely on the shutdown\u2019s impact and reflected an effort by the office, which is led by Nina E. Olson, to capture the typical taxpayer experience when dealing with I.R.S. The audit said many Americans\u2019 feelings about the process could be boiled down to two words: \u201cextreme frustration.\u201dThe audit found that a policy change made by the Trump administration intended to simplify the tax-filing process \u2014 the creation of a \u201cpostcard size\u201d 1040 form \u2014 has made filing more difficult because the new form does not include much of the information that many taxpayers need to complete their returns.\u201cThe new schedules will force some taxpayers to cross-reference and transfer data such as credits, deductions and income, increasing the potential for errors to occur since the tax information is dispersed over many pages and needs to be tracked down and reported on different schedules and forms,\u201d the report says.The problems that became apparent during the 35-day shutdown, which ended Jan. 25, underscored some of the agency\u2019s deeper flaws, including a reliance on 1960s-era technology, the audit found. The systems that contain the official record of taxpayer accounts are the oldest in the federal government.\u201cFor the last 25 years the I.R.S. has tried \u2014 and been unable \u2014 to replace them,\u201d the audit says, citing budgetary constraints.The outdated systems deprive the I.R.S. of a comprehensive view of taxpayers\u2019 accounts, hampering the agency\u2019s ability to properly identify who should be targeted for outreach, collections and audits.Inadequate financing is a primary cause of the agency\u2019s failings, the audit found. Congress has long beat up on the I.R.S., routinely condemning its performance while cutting its budget. For example, money for technology improvements in the 2018 fiscal year was reduced 62 percent, to $110 million, from the year before.Taxpayers who called the I.R.S. last fall for advice about how the new tax law would affect them were frequently told that there was \u201cno tax law personnel at this time due to budgetary cuts\u201d and were disconnected, the audit found. Part of the reason was a decision by the agency to answer tax law questions only during the three and a half months from January until tax filing day.A lack of information has also meant that the vast majority of taxpayers eligible to use free software to file their returns electronically do not take advantage of the program. Of the 106 million taxpayers who could qualify for the free program, fewer than 2.5 million use it."}, {"title": "U.S.-China Trade Talks Face Big Obstacle: Ensuring That Promises Are Kept", "category": "Business", "id": "231c4c89-c94f-4637-905f-3e6ae04fdda8", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/business/us-china-trade-talks.html", "publishdate": 20190212, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/12/business/12CHINATRADE-1/merlin_144827730_0058c27b-d7fa-400b-b03a-65c02d60aab2-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 When China joined the World Trade Organization, the global fraternity of cross-border commerce, it promised to open itself up to foreigners in lucrative businesses like banking, telecommunications and electronic-payment processing.More than 17 years later, China\u2019s telecommunications industry remains firmly under government control.

They face a March 2 deadline, after which President Trump has threatened to increase by more than double the tariffs the administration imposed last autumn on $200 billion a year on Chinese imports.A top priority for Mr. Lighthizer and Mr. Mnuchin, according to several people with detailed knowledge of the negotiations, is to ensure that any deal they strike has teeth if Beijing does not live up to its obligations.American negotiators want to create a mechanism that would automatically raise tariffs on Chinese goods if its exports to the United States keep rising, said three of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are not public.Even a temporary deal that simply papers over the two countries\u2019 differences could benefit both the Chinese government, which is contending with slowing economic growth, and Mr. Trump, who wants to be able to declare a victory after a string of political defeats. But the talks face big obstacles, including how to enforce China\u2019s earlier promises and whether Chinese officials will make further pledges on issues like protecting intellectual property, halting forced transfers of American technology and limiting government subsidies to exporters.\u201cAt this point, a full-scale accord seems unlikely,\u201d said Mark Wu, a Harvard Law School professor and former United States trade official.Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would consider delaying the March 2 deadline if he felt the negotiations were going well.\u201cIf we\u2019re close to a deal where we think we can make a real deal, I could see myself letting them slide for a little while,\u201d the president said during remarks at the Oval Office. Mr. Trump added that he wanted any agreement \u201cto be a real deal, not just a deal that looks cosmetically good for a year.\u201dBut he appeared to acknowledge that not all of the outstanding issues were likely to be resolved by negotiators and that he and President Xi Jinping of China might need to be involved before a final agreement is reached.\u201cAt some point, I expect to meet with Xi,\u201d Mr. Trump said, noting that the two leaders could potentially \u201cmake the parts of the deal that the group is unable to make.\u201dThe American negotiators will probably get a frosty greeting in Beijing.Already, a stopgap deal reached by Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi on Dec. 1 in Buenos Aires has proved to be unpopular within the Chinese government, people with detailed knowledge of Chinese economic policy deliberations said. The agreement essentially allowed Mr. Trump to maintain tariffs he had ordered on Chinese goods while China stepped back from many of its retaliatory moves.The internal displeasure in Beijing may be contributing to the lack of progress in trade talks since then. United States trade officials noted at a White House briefing on Jan. 31 that negotiators had not produced a draft framework of what a final agreement might look like.Still, given the Chinese government\u2019s track record for failing to keep its trade promises, American negotiators feel that any deal must have some sort of mechanism that will swiftly inflict higher tariffs on China if it does not comply.The mechanism they have in mind is one Beijing has fought vociferously in the past.When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, the international body approved a rule that allowed member countries to raise tariffs if increases in Chinese exports disrupted their domestic markets. Many countries were loath to use it, given China\u2019s growing economic might.ImagePresident Trump and President Xi Jinping of China on Dec. 1 in Buenos Aires, where they reached a stopgap trade deal that is unpopular in Beijing.CreditKevin Lamarque/ReutersPresident George W. Bush turned down four chances to invoke the rule, because his advisers feared doing so might set off a full-blown trade war.President Barack Obama used it once, in 2009, to impose tariffs on Chinese-made tires. China answered by placing tariffs on American cars, keeping the duties in place until 2013, and poultry imports, which Beijing lifted only last year. The W.T.O. sided with the United States, although the Obama administration was criticized at home over the added cost to consumers.The tariff landscape has changed since then. The right to employ such provisions against China under W.T.O. rules expired in 2013, theoretically making any retaliatory moves by China now more defensible on the world stage.The Trump administration\u2019s negotiators want to be able to use the maneuver anyway, according to the people familiar with the talks. That would include easing the current legal requirement, under Section 421 of the 1974 Trade Act, that the government prove other countries\u2019 exports are hurting American industries before the president can impose tariffs.Raising the prospect of such tariffs is a gamble for the Trump administration. Despite China\u2019s previous opposition, American officials hope the country\u2019s current economic weakness will outweigh those concerns at the negotiating table.Many American companies used to be critical of the trade law. Business leaders are more divided on the subject these days, with some sympathetic to the administration\u2019s view that China does too much to help its exporters and to discourage imports.United States trade officials are motivated by what they see as a litany of failures by Beijing to live up to its trade promises.China is still in the regulatory process for allowing foreign credit card companies like Visa and Mastercard into its market. China agreed to let in foreign electronic-payment services when it joined the W.T.O., and then lost a case at the trade body in 2012 for not having done so.China also agreed in 2001 to let in foreign banks, but then set regulations so stringent that foreign banks found it hard to meet them. Foreign banks now represent less than 2 percent of banking assets in China.China also agreed in 2001 to allow some foreign telecommunications services into the country. But Beijing has defined such access narrowly and has blocked internet services like Google and Facebook and overseas cloud computing services like Amazon\u2019s.China banned American beef during a mad cow disease scare in 2003. Despite numerous agreements since then to fully reopen the market, shipments of American beef for human or pet consumption continue to encounter obstacles.Chinese officials insist that they have consistently delivered on their promises, but that acting on them has sometimes taken longer than expected. There is little evidence that the foot-dragging stems from a single government policy. The reform-minded Chinese officials who negotiated the country\u2019s entry into the W.T.O. hoped it would force China to become more market oriented and shake up the sluggish state-controlled part of the economy. But powerful bureaucrats and state-run companies fought to protect their turf, slowing progress in many areas.American interest in revisiting a W.T.O.-style rule to increase tariffs is not the only obstacle to reaching even the outlines of a deal this week. American officials also want the Chinese government to stop subsidizing exporters and to take other steps to relax the government\u2019s hold on the economy.But Trump administration officials have consistently declined to provide a detailed text spelling out how they think China should amend its laws and policies, contending that only those changes that are drafted by Beijing officials are likely to be put in place.Despite the seemingly wide gulf between the countries, some experts contend that a lot of progress could be made if the two sides agree on how to enforce a deal.\u201cThis could very well be the best opportunity to confront China\u2019s predatory and protectionist policies,\u201d said Michael Wessel, a member of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, an advisory body created by Congress."}, {"title": "Kamala Harris Is Accused of Lying About Listening to Tupac.

Senator Kamala Harris, the California Democrat and former prosecutor who announced her presidential candidacy last month, revealed on a popular radio show this week that she had smoked marijuana during her college years at Howard University in Washington.But after a viral tweet ignited backlash from marijuana activists and conservatives, Ms. Harris faces accusations that she fabricated parts of her story. In the midst of answering simultaneous questions about what music she listens to, she appeared to some to say she listened to rap artists like Tupac and Snoop Dogg as she smoked in college, though neither released an album until after she graduated.Conservative news outlets feasted on what they portrayed as an embarrassing gaffe, with the popular morning show \u201cFox & Friends\u201d even dedicating a segment to it Wednesday morning. Less partisan media outlets also publicized the supposed controversy, with some alleging that it was further proof Ms. Harris, who is likely the most viable black woman ever to run for president, was playing up parts of her identity in order to impress black voters.How is this real life Leading Fox News' website right now: \"Chronic Memory Problem: Kamala Harris' claim about smoking pot while listening to Snoop, Tupac, goes up in smoke\" pic.twitter.com/Kn4LjbYk8W\u2014 Lis Power (@LisPower1) February 12, 2019\nThe only problem: Ms. Harris\u2019s campaign vehemently denies that she ever claimed to be listening to Tupac and Snoop Dogg while in college, and a video recording of the radio interview provides additional context that may support that account.How it startedMs. Harris appeared Monday morning on \u201cThe Breakfast Club,\u201d the wildly popular and wide-ranging morning radio show that often focuses on hip-hop and black culture. During her appearance, Ms. Harris discussed her support for marijuana legalization, and said she wanted the federal government to loosen restrictions so the drug could be properly researched.Charlamagne tha God, one of the show\u2019s hosts, asked Ms. Harris if she had ever smoked marijuana herself \u2014 a question presidential candidates have long been loath to answer. Ms. Harris confidently said she had, adding, \u201cand I did inhale.\u201d\u201cIt was a long time ago,\u201d Ms. Harris said, laughing.Later in the interview, Ms. Harris was asked about her taste in music. She has previously named California artists like Tupac and Snoop Dogg among her favorites.\u201cWhat does Kamala Harris listen to?\u201d asked D.J. Envy, another one of the show\u2019s hosts.Before Ms. Harris answered the question, Charlamagne tha God interjected, asking her to say what she listened to while she smoked in college. Everyone laughed, before D.J. Envy appeared to return to his original question.\u201cWas it Snoop?\u201d he asked.\u201cOh yeah, definitely Snoop,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cTupac for sure.\u201dChaos ensued. The viral tweet pointed out that Snoop Dogg and Tupac did not debut until Ms. Harris had left college. Then music blogs and conservative outlets begin to write up the exchange. However, several of them omitted the fact that D.J. Envy had asked Ms. Harris more generally about her music opinions, a key portion in the exchange that makes it unclear whose question Ms. Harris was responding to.Ms. Harris\u2019s campaign attempted to quell the backlash on Twitter, but \u201cReefergate,\u201d as her national press secretary, Ian Sams, coined it, had already taken off.Why it mattersIn a crowded and diverse Democratic primary field with no clear front-runner, Ms. Harris has emerged as a top-tier candidate, and the strong rollout of her campaign has increasingly made her a political target. Liberal critics have long had policy differences with Ms. Harris, saying her record on criminal justice and immigrant rights left much to be desired. Others have pointed out how Ms. Harris\u2019s admission that she smoked marijuana in college flies in the face of her record as a prosecutor and the fact that she opposed marijuana legalization during her time as California attorney general.Conservatives who support President Trump have tried to stoke divisions surrounding her candidacy, branding her as inauthentic and manufactured particularly on issues of race and identity.This month, a viral meme showed a tweet from Ms. Harris clumsily posting about an online challenge popular among young internet users. The tweet was fake, but it didn\u2019t matter \u2014 it garnered thousands of shares online. And in the days after Ms. Harris announced her presidential campaign, another widely spread internet theory claimed she was ineligible to run for president because of her parents\u2019 immigration status. This was also false.Ms. Harris, whose mother was Tamil Indian and whose father is Jamaican, has rebuffed questions about whether she is \u201cblack enough\u201d to appeal to black voters nationally.\u201cI\u2019m black, and I\u2019m proud of being black,\u201d Ms. Harris said in the \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d interview. \u201cI was born black. I will die black, and I\u2019m not going to make excuses for anybody because they don\u2019t understand.\u201dRegardless, she\u2019s repeatedly being forced to answer questions about whether she\u2019s pandering for black votes.Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee and the first woman to win a major party\u2019s presidential nomination, faced similar charges of inauthenticity, driven by internet rumors that were also backed up by questionable evidence. When Mrs. Clinton visited \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d in 2016, she ignited controversy after she said she carried hot sauce in her purse. Conservatives and young liberals accused her of trying overtly to win black votes with a reference to the line \u201cI got hot sauce in my bag\u201d from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s instant classic song \u201cFormation,\u201d which debuted that year.\u201cSriracha Gate? Hillary Clinton Mocked Mercilessly for Hot Sauce Comment,\u201d read one headline.\u201cClinton stirs anger by claiming she carries hot sauce in her bag, like Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d read another.But like Monday\u2019s episode with Ms. Harris, the truth was more complicated: Mrs. Clinton\u2019s well-documented love of hot sauce dated to at least the 1990s \u2014 long before \u201cFormation\u201d existed."}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: Trump\u2019s Shifting Trade Talk Deadline", "category": "Business", "id": "a5f76812-78ff-4496-b025-1790d5a12f08", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/business/dealbook/trump-trade-china-deadline.html", "publishdate": 20190213, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/business/14db-newsletter-trump/merlin_150582879_50ef5003-03d4-413e-8605-23b69e36b8ee-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Wednesday.

The president characterized those discussions as \u201cgoing well,\u201d according to Deborah B. Solomon of the NYT, and said he thought the U.S. had a chance \u201cto make a real deal.\u201d He added that he wanted \u201ca real deal, not just a deal that looks cosmetically good for a year.\u201dBut any pact will face a big obstacle: Chinese commitment. A history of broken policy promises between China and the rest of the world hangs over U.S. negotiators, Keith Bradsher of the NYT writes.

According to the British broadcaster ITV News, one of its reporters heard Oliver Robbins, one of Mrs. May\u2019s top aides, discussing the plans in a hotel bar. \u201cThe issue is whether Brussels is clear on the terms of extension,\u201d Mr. Robbins reportedly said. \u201cIn the end they will probably just give us an extension.\u201dMrs. May previously opposed a delay. She has insisted that lawmakers have a choice between her deal or no deal. \u201cAn option to extend for a longer period would just continue the uncertainty,\u201d she told business leaders in a conference call yesterday.The comments could spell trouble for her. They may undermine her efforts to muster enough support in Parliament for her deal. Mrs. May\u2019s office had no comment on the remarks attributed to Mr. Robbins.More Brexit news: The Bank of England\u2019s governor, Mark Carney, said that the potential economic harm from Brexit shows that trade uncertainty can be more damaging than a financial crisis. Economists say that the British economy could improve if a deal is reached. Ford reportedly told Mrs. May that it is preparing alternative production sites outside Britain as a result of Brexit.ImageJohn Legere, left, T-Mobile\u2019s C.E.O., and Marcelo Claure, Sprint\u2019s executive chairman, before Congress last year.CreditMandel Ngan/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesT-Mobile and Sprint face off against CongressThe carriers\u2019 C.E.O.s are scheduled to appear on Capitol Hill this week to defend T-Mobile\u2019s proposed $26 billion acquisition of Sprint. Their first stop is the House Committee on Energy and Commerce today, where they\u2019ll face Democrats who are increasingly skeptical about letting the nation\u2019s third- and fourth-biggest carriers combine.What to expect: John Legere of T-Mobile will repeat his claim that merging the two companies would create a stronger rival to Verizon and AT&T. \u201cI want to reiterate unequivocally that prices will go down and customers will get more for less,\u201d he told Bloomberg in an interview. And he\u2019ll emphasize the combined company\u2019s ability to roll out 5G wireless service, playing off fears that the U.S. may fall behind China in that area.But lawmakers have issues with the deal. Democrats think a merger would actually increase prices for consumers, as well as bring job cuts. Some lawmakers also contend that promises to increase rural wireless broadband are empty. And some critics say that dozens of stays by Mr. Legere at President Trump\u2019s Washington hotel since the deal was announced may have been improper.A political caveat: Though Democratic opposition to the deal appears to be growing \u2014 nine senators called for the deal to be blocked \u2014 Congress doesn\u2019t get a say. It can only apply pressure to the Justice Department and the F.C.C. to block it.Still, the telecoms aren\u2019t resting easy. Bloomberg notes that the spread between T-Mobile\u2019s offer price and Sprint\u2019s stock price has grown since December, suggesting that investors think the deal\u2019s chances of winning approval are getting worse.The U.S. edges toward a China wireless banThe Trump administration is moving closer to barring telecom companies in the U.S. from using Chinese equipment while building next-generation wireless networks, Julian E. Barnes of the NYT writes.\u2022 \u201cThe executive order, which has been under discussion for months, is aimed largely at preventing Chinese telecom firms like Huawei from gaining access to the fifth-generation \u2014 or 5G \u2014 wireless networks that companies are beginning to build in the United States.\u201d\u2022 \u201cPresident Trump has been briefed on the proposed ban, which would prevent the use of equipment from \u2018adversarial powers,\u2019 and the order could be issued in the coming days, American government and industry officials said.\u201dThe case against a ban: Robert Hannigan, a former director of the British intelligence agency G.C.H.Q., argues in the FT that blanket bans on Chinese tech \u201cmake no sense.\u201d Lawmakers, he says, should \u201cbase decisions on Chinese involvement in future telecoms on technical expertise and rational assessment of risk, rather than political fashion or trade wars.\u201dCarlos Ghosn\u2019s new legal tackThe former Nissan chairman, who\u2019s still detained in Japan, has replaced his legal team \u2014 perhaps in a bid to try a more aggressive strategy.Who\u2019s out: Motonari Otsuru, a former prosecutor familiar with the tactics employed in Japanese courtrooms.Who\u2019s in: Junichiro Hironaka, whose nickname in Japan is \u201cthe innocence contractor.\u201d He has successfully defended government officials against corruption charges and a prominent businessman against accusations of insider dealing.Potentially behind the change: The FT notes that \u201cMr. Otsuru at times appeared to defend the practices of Japanese prosecutors and the way that suspects are interrogated without the presence of their lawyers.\u201dMore Nissan news: The French government reportedly pressed the Japanese carmaker about merging with its corporate sibling, Renault, but was rebuffed. And the company reported a 45 percent drop in third-quarter earnings yesterday.ImageJeff and MacKenzie BezosCreditDanny Moloshok/ReutersAmerica\u2019s wealthiest donors are giving lessThe Chronicle of Philanthropy\u2019s list of the 50 most generous donors to charitable causes shows that they jointly gave $7.8 billion in 2018. That\u2019s impressive \u2014 until you compare it to 2017, when donors gave $14.7 billion.Topping the list were Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos, who gave $2 billion. Michael Bloomberg was a distant second, having given $767 million. Other notable donors included Blackstone\u2019s Steve Schwarzman, Mark and Priscilla Zuckerberg, and Bill and Melinda Gates.The drop-off in giving was stark. Theodore Schleifer of Recode points out that Mr. and Ms. Gates gave $138 million to their foundation last year, compared with $4.8 billion in 2017. The Zuckerbergs donated $200 million last year, down from $2 billion in 2017.The big picture: As Mr. Schleifer notes, this shows \u201chow a few decisions by the country\u2019s wealthiest Americans can totally change the portrait of big-dollar philanthropy.\u201d The drop in charitable giving, he adds, comes at a bad time, \u201cgiven the louder conversation in the U.S. about the responsibilities of billionaires.\u201dPublishers don\u2019t like Apple\u2019s news plansSome of America\u2019s largest news publishers are unhappy with the financial terms of a news subscription service that Apple plans to unveil later this year, according to the WSJ, citing unnamed sources.\u2022 \u201cThe service, described by industry executives as a \u2018Netflix for news,\u2019 would allow users to read an unlimited amount of content from participating publishers for a monthly fee.\u201d\u2022 BuzzFeed reports, citing anonymous sources, that it is expected to be unveiled on March 25.\u2022 But \u201cin its pitch to some news organizations, the Cupertino, Calif., company has said it would keep about half of the subscription revenue from the service,\u201d according to the WSJ.\u2022 \u201cAnother concern for some publishers is that they likely wouldn\u2019t get access to subscriber data, including credit-card information and email addresses.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe New York Times and the Washington Post are among the major outlets that so far haven\u2019t agreed to license their content to the service, in part because of concerns over the proposed terms.\u201dChris Christie\u2019s takes on 2020The former N.J. governor weighed in on the presidential race at a party for his new book last night.

An hour later, they took her and her lawyer away.Ms. Ressa\u2019s arrest is the most dramatic sign yet of Mr. Duterte\u2019s crackdown on the news media in the Philippines. Mr. Duterte has not tried to hide his disdain for journalists, calling reporters \u201csons of bitches\u201d and \u201cspies\u201d and even warning that they are \u201cnot exempted from assassination.\u201dAs she left the building flanked by police officers, Ms. Ressa addressed reporters, telling them, \u201cI will do the right thing.\u201d\u201cThese legal acrobatics show how far the government will go to silence journalists, including the pettiness of forcing me to spend the night in jail,\u201d she later added in an emailed statement.A judge initially denied bail to Ms. Ressa on Wednesday night, and she stayed in a conference room at the jail, editors at Rappler said. She was released after her lawyers posted bail for her on Thursday morning.Chay Hofile\u00f1a, a Rappler executive, said the arrest was \u201cabout media intimidation and media harassment.\u201d\u201cThis is proof,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause Rappler has been critical of the government, and they are very intent on silencing us.\u201dMs. Ressa had already been served an arrest warrant and turned herself in to the authorities in December to face tax evasion charges. This time, the arrest warrant was related to an article that Rappler published in May 2012. In both cases, Ms. Ressa has called the charges \u201cunfounded\u201d and part of a larger attack on news outlets in the Philippines.The arrest on Wednesday stemmed from an indictment filed by the Department of Justice against Ms. Ressa and Reynaldo Santos Jr., a former researcher and writer for Rappler. The  article that\u2019s involved said Renato Corona, then the chief justice, had used a car that was registered to a businessman named Wilfredo Keng.The Cybercrime Prevention Act, under which Ms. Ressa was charged, was approved four months after the article\u2019s publication and came into effect in October 2012.In a court filing last year, Ms. Ressa denied the charges and called them \u201cbaffling and unfounded,\u201d adding that the government was applying a law retroactively.For several years, Rappler and other news outlets have closely followed a brutal antidrug war waged by Mr. Duterte that has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people. Their coverage helped draw international attention to the campaign, resulting in widespread international rebuke.Mr. Duterte has also threatened reporters from other publications and warned that he would not allow the renewal of the license for ABS-CBN, the biggest broadcast news network in the Philippines.But Ms. Ressa has been on the receiving end of an onslaught of legal attacks by the government. Her star political reporter has been stripped of her press pass, equivalent to a White House pass, and Rappler has been barred from covering presidential appearances. She faces charges related to a handful of different laws including ones governing financial securities and cybercrimes.The arrest on Wednesday provoked an outcry from journalists in the Philippines. The country\u2019s National Union of Journalists said in a statement that the \u201cclearly manipulated charge of cyber libel\u201d was \u201ca shameless act of persecution by a bully government.\u201d\u201cIt may try its damnedest, but we know it will fail,\u201d the statement added of the government and its actions, because \u201cindependent Filipino journalists will never allow freedom of the press to be suppressed.\u201dMs. Ressa created Rappler in 2012 with three high-powered journalists \u2014 Lilibeth Frondoso, Glenda Gloria and Ms. Hofile\u00f1a \u2014 who cut their teeth as reporters during the \u201cpeople power\u201d revolt that brought down President Ferdinand E. Marcos in the mid-1980s. They shared a view that the internet would be a platform to level the playing field in news and give a voice to the voiceless.They have been threatened with death and arrested before. For example, Ms. Frondoso, head of multimedia at Rappler, once found herself in prison with her newborn child, and Ms. Gloria, the managing editor, once opened her door to find a black funeral wreath on her doorstep.Rappler gained traction with the rise of Mr. Duterte, a political strongman who came to power amid a wave of populism.Ms. Ressa\u2019s arrest comes as journalists in many parts of the world are facing increasing pressure from their governments. In one glaring example, two Reuters journalists are serving a seven-year prison sentence for reporting on atrocities against the Rohingya minority in Myanmar."}, {"title": "Smaller Tax Refunds Surprise Those Expecting More Relief", "category": "Business", "id": "1427cb36-0855-4dc1-9998-b93b22240150", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/your-money/tax-refund-decrease.html", "publishdate": 20190213, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/13/business/13REFUNDS-1/merlin_145494135_18d2554a-bacd-4b5e-b589-c2fb5fa4ae41-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The tax preparers at H&R Block had to take a new class before their busy season started this year: empathy training.They listened to a mock exchange between an employee and a customer whose refund would not just shrink but disappear. The fictitious client had received a $1,500 refund last year, but this year would owe $575.The playacting was prescient. The tax overhaul that took effect last year promised relief, but now that returns are being filed, some people are baffled. They\u2019re getting smaller refunds \u2014 or sometimes having to write a check \u2014 even though nothing in their situation seems to have changed.The average refund among early filers was down 8.4 percent, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The smaller checks, in some cases, stem from the loss of certain deductions. For others, it\u2019s because less money is being withheld from their paychecks. The I.R.S., in trying to more closely match the amount held out of paychecks with the amount that taxpayers will owe, changed its withholding tables.The result is that taxpayers may be paying less over all but still getting a bill after filing their return. That has caught many people off guard.Ashley Alt, who works in information technology in Illinois, said she was floored when her tax program spit out her $4,800 bill. \u201cI was expecting to get less of a refund or maybe owe a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not expect to owe two months of take-home pay.\u201d[Read more from our 2019 tax guide: The eight most common questions, answered by experts; superrich Trump critics bemoan their huge refunds; a new tax break for small businesses.]The overhaul has been President Trump\u2019s signature accomplishment. It lowered tax rates for businesses and individuals, and it provided a break to self-employed people and those with so-called pass-through businesses, where income passes through the business to the owner\u2019s personal tax returns.But it also eliminated or cut back some popular deductions, most notably capping the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000 \u2014 a provision that drew significant criticism from residents of high-tax states. Although most people will see their tax burden decline, the Government Accountability Office expected about four million people to pay more.Taxpayer frustration has taken on a political dimension. Some Democrats, including Senator Kamala Harris of California, a presidential candidate, seized on the issue to hound Mr. Trump, calling the overhaul a tax hike on the middle class to \u201cline the pockets of already wealthy corporations.\u201d Online outrage has led to a #GOPTaxScam hashtag on Twitter just as taxpayers, trying to navigate the new rules, have encountered roadblocks because of the monthlong government shutdown.On Monday, the Treasury Department pushed back against reports of smaller refunds, saying it was still early in the filing season. \u201cRefunds are consistent with 2017 levels and down slightly from 2018 based on a small initial sample from only a few days of data,\u201d the department wrote on Twitter.And tax experts said some people who would receive larger refunds \u2014 those claiming the earned-income tax credit \u2014 aren\u2019t getting their checks yet.The confusion over the new rules underscores the harried nature of this year\u2019s tax season. The I.R.S. is getting back up to speed after the shutdown, which began just as its workers were preparing for the arrival of returns. And some accountants are still going through training to understand all the changes.Many tax professionals said they had tried to prepare their clients as best as they could by having them adjust the amount they have withheld from their checks.Ms. Alt, 36, said she and her wife had not adjusted their withholdings, and believed that was the reason for the reversal from last year\u2019s refund. The bill is big enough that she hasn\u2019t filed her return yet.\u201cI need to figure out a way to get all the money together,\u201d she said.Since the overhaul took effect, tax professionals have expected filers who face high state and local taxes to be hit hard by the cap on those deductions. But the legislation did away with a number of other deductions that have created surprises for many.Nancy Bay, a 65-year-old bookkeeper from Garrett, Ind., was disheartened to learn how the new rules would affect her and her husband, a truck driver. While they usually receive a refund of about $1,500, they will have to pay about $400 this year.ImageChanges to the amount that companies withhold from paychecks mean some people may have a lower tax burden but still face a bill once they file their returns.CreditMark Lennihan/Associated PressMs. Bay blamed the withholding issue, and the loss of her husband\u2019s ability to deduct his business expenses, which are not reimbursed by the trucking company he works for. Even the larger standard deduction did not make up for it, Ms. Bay said.\u201cHe cannot come home to eat each night to save money,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has to pay for showers. He has a cellphone that he used for business \u2014 we used to be able to deduct part of that.\u201dThe speed from bill to law and from law to how it works in practice has made for a steep learning curve.Matthew Horowitz, a certified public accountant in Columbia, Md., was taking continuing education courses to learn more about a new tax rule that allows some business owners and self-employed people to deduct 20 percent of their \u201cqualified business income.\u201d\u201cI would never take continuing ed during tax season,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re all going for three hours on Friday \u2014 it\u2019s on nothing but the Section 199A deduction.\u201dJanet Lee Krochman, an accountant from Costa Mesa, Calif., said she was also still learning about how the rule worked.\u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting to get 180 pages of regulations on the 18th of January, 10 days to the opening of filing season,\u201d she said.There have been other complexities. Tax filers in places that require their state and federal returns to mirror each other \u2014 for example, if they take the standard deduction on their federal return, they must do the same on their state return \u2014 may end up owing more to their states than in the past. The reason: Standard deductions in states like Kansas, Virginia and Maryland are on the lower end. (Lawmakers in states including Virginia and Maryland have voted to raise their standard deductions to help compensate.)As a result, tax pros in these states are suggesting running multiple sets of calculations. It may be worth sacrificing the larger federal standard deduction to itemize on the state level and get a bigger return there.\u201cIf you are single with significant state income or real estate taxes, by choosing to deduct the lower amount of itemized deductions on your federal return you may reduce your overall federal and state tax due to the increased deduction on your Kansas return,\u201d said Julie Welch, an accountant in Leawood, Kan. \u201cIt pays to run the calculation.\u201dDespite the confusion, some accountants have had the pleasure of delivering good news. Conor Barnes, an accountant at Egan Tax & Books in New York, prepares returns for many renters who typically don\u2019t have enough individual deductions to itemize their returns. Instead, those filers take the standard deduction, which has doubled.\u201cNow that the standard deduction is higher than what it has been,\u201d Ms. Barnes said, \u201cpeople without mortgage interest and real estate taxes are seeing a tax benefit they haven\u2019t seen in prior years.\u201dShe also works with a lot of freelance workers, including photographers, who didn\u2019t realize they would receive a nice tax benefit from the new qualified business income deduction.Jackson Hewitt, a tax preparer that caters to moderate-income clients, said it was seeing more filers with lower tax liabilities and higher refunds. Some were taking an immediate advance that would be paid back when their check arrived from the government.\u201cOur refunds are better right now,\u201d said Mark Steber, the company\u2019s chief tax officer. \u201cBut we have those customers because we have a product where you can get your money that day. We are predispositioned to get those customers.\u201dEven some people who knew they would be on the hook for more come tax time have been unpleasantly surprised.Robin Baker Williams, 44, and her husband expected a bigger tax bill because she was returning to the work force, taking a job as a high school history teacher. The Virginia couple got a $2,000 tax refund last year. But this time around, the loss of some deductions and lower withholdings from her husband\u2019s checks meant they owe $3,000 on their federal return \u2014 a $5,000 swing.\u201cWe were expecting to have to pay something,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t thinking it was going to be such a huge difference.\u201d"}, {"title": "One Investment Firm Found a Silver Lining in the Mortgage Industry: Software", "category": "Business", "id": "51820d27-aaf7-47e3-bb98-8c7042b9b99b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/business/dealbook/thoma-bravo-ellie-mae.html", "publishdate": 20190213, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/business/14db-viewsthoma/merlin_129283814_b2c44945-2650-493d-904b-9cc78ece857f-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________No, this isn\u2019t about Fannie Mae.

It\u2019s Ellie Mae, the publicly traded provider of mortgage-processing software-as-a-service to American home lenders.The investment firm Thoma Bravo is paying $3.7 billion to acquire the Pleasanton, Calif.-based Ellie Mae. That\u2019s more than 25 times the software company\u2019s projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for this year, according to estimates collated by Refinitiv, and a nearly 50 percent premium to its stock\u2019s latest 30-day closing average.It\u2019s a pretty price to pay for exposure to a market that is being buffeted by rising interest rates, slipping home-price gains and worries about affordability. The Mortgage Bankers Association believes that United States home-loan originations declined by a little over 5 percent last year to $1.6 trillion.But such headwinds make the cost benefits of outsourced automation all the more attractive to lenders. Mortgage loan processing has always been tedious, and new regulations imposed in the wake of the subprime-mortgage crisis only added to the burden.Ellie Mae estimates that the cost of making a new mortgage loan more than doubled between 2007 and 2017, to just over $8,000. It claims to be able to reduce those costs by about a third. More than 2,300 lenders have adopted the company\u2019s software and used it to close more than 2.5 million loans. The goal of the 22-year-old business is to \u201cautomate everything automatable.\u201d It assessed its own market share at 35 percent in 2017, and its target is for more than half.The company, led by Jonathan Corr, isn\u2019t immune to broader trends, of course. Full-year profit for 2018 is projected to fall by about half from 2017, while revenue growth is expected to slow to 6 percent this year from 15 percent last year, according to data from Refinitiv. But it has no debt on its balance sheet, giving a private-equity buyer room to leverage its returns, even if not to the stretched levels possible in some industries.And investors seem to believe the sky is the limit for cloud-based software services. That may explain why Ellie Mae\u2019s stock traded slightly above the offer price for much of the day on Thursday, suggesting that Thoma Bravo\u2019s $99-a-share offer may not be the final word."}, {"title": "The Struggle to Control PG&E", "category": "Business", "id": "a5d6c06e-2a73-48e9-8028-3f22b17f7803", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/business/energy-environment/pge-wildfire-bankruptcy-control.html", "publishdate": 20190213, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/business/14govern3/merlin_150072060_924a0af6-265e-40c4-a101-e8994b477b6e-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Pacific Gas & Electric, the California utility that faces billions of dollars in wildfire damages, hopes to use its bankruptcy to reduce its liabilities and emerge a more stable company. But the company\u2019s management and board of directors might not have all that much control over the outcome.Before a bankruptcy judge has even had a chance to delve into PG&E\u2019s financial problems, investors, lawmakers, regulators and customers are trying to exert authority over the utility and shape its future.The latestBlueMountain Capital, a New York investment firm that owns PG&E stock, said on Wednesday that it had recruited 13 people to replace the company\u2019s directors, though it did not name them. The move came days after PG&E\u2019s board said it was also seeking to replace at least half of its current group of 10 members.Creditors and wildfire victims are forming committees in bankruptcy court to make sure the utility pays them what they are owed. Companies that sell power to PG&E are requesting that federal regulators intervene in the bankruptcy to make sure the utility is not able to renegotiate its contracts with suppliers. In a separate case, a sharp-tongued federal judge is insisting that PG&E eliminate the risk of its equipment igniting wildfires, a tall order for a company that has been blamed for starting more than a dozen major fires in the last two years. And the California Public Utilities Commission is studying options that include breaking up PG&E, which serves 16 million people, or turning all or parts of it into a government-owned utility. ImageGov. Gavin Newsom said this week that he was considering broader changes to California's energy industry in light of the increasing frequency of deadly wildfires.CreditRich Pedroncelli/Associated PressCalifornia\u2019s elected leaders will also play a role. They have to decide how much to help PG&E and the state\u2019s other two investor-owned utilities without being accused of bailing them out. In his first State of the State address on Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized PG&E while signaling that his administration was considering broader changes to the state\u2019s energy system.Legal experts say it could take years to resolve PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy because it involves so many players with disparate interests seeking different outcomes.\u201cThis is the most complicated and difficult decision environment I\u2019ve ever seen for a bankruptcy case,\u201d said Jared A. Ellias, a professor at the University of California\u2019s Hastings College of the Law. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a bankruptcy that had this many powerful parties with unclear bargaining power.\u201dWill California lighten utilities\u2019 wildfire liabilities?Investors seem to believe the company, even with all of its problems and liabilities, is still worth a lot of money \u2014 nearly $8 billion at Wednesday\u2019s market close. They appear to be betting that California lawmakers will eventually set up a better approach for bearing the costs of more frequent wildfires. PG&E\u2019s stock surged on Tuesday after Mr. Newsom said he was open to changing the state\u2019s current approach to paying for wildfire damage. \u201cRegulations and insurance practices created decades ago didn\u2019t anticipate these changes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must map out longer-term strategies, not just for the utilities\u2019 future, but for California\u2019s energy future.\u201dUnder a provision of California\u2019s Constitution referred to as inverse condemnation, utilities are liable for wildfires caused by their equipment even when the companies were not negligent in maintaining it. Partly as a result, PG&E has estimated that its wildfire liabilities could total more than $30 billion, much more than it says it can afford. ImageCrews repairing power lines that were destroyed in November in Paradise, Calif. PG&E; says it will step up tree trimming, equipment inspections and precautionary blackouts to reduce the risk of fires.CreditJustin Sullivan/Getty ImagesThe California Legislature passed a bill last year that allows PG&E and other utilities to raise rates to pay for some of their wildfire liabilities. But the process can be subject to delays, and the law does not allow utilities to recoup the cost of 2018 wildfires, which could account for a large chunk of PG&E\u2019s liabilities. As a result, the judge overseeing the company\u2019s bankruptcy, Judge Dennis Montali, may want to be assured that California\u2019s politicians have come up with a better cost-sharing system before releasing the company from bankruptcy. The judge might conclude that without a change to state laws, the company could have to file for bankruptcy protection again in a few years.\u201cThe judge can say, \u2018I don\u2019t have a confirmable plan of reorganization because you have provided nothing to account for the risk of future liability,\u2019\u201d said G. Marcus Cole, a bankruptcy expert and professor at Stanford Law School. \u201cIt\u2019s totally within the judge\u2019s discretion to make the determination.\u201dIs PG&E doing enough to reduce the risk of devastating wildfires?Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco is overseeing PG&E\u2019s probation in a separate, criminal case that stems from a gas pipeline explosion in 2010 in San Bruno. He is pressuring the company to eliminate the risk that the utility\u2019s equipment could start wildfires. PG&E has said complying with the judge\u2019s proposal could cost up to $150 billion. Last month Judge Alsup ripped into the company. \u201cI feel a responsibility after two years of this to step in and do something about this if somebody else doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said. ImageThe remains of residences leveled by the wildfire in Paradise.CreditNoah Berger/Associated PressPG&E filed a wildfire safety plan with the utilities commission last week. The company said it would spend up to $2.3 billion this year to reduce wildfires. Its plan calls for more tree trimming, equipment inspections and precautionary blackouts on dry and windy days. The company\u2019s board said it was looking for new directors with expertise in safety. BlueMountain said the same on Wednesday. But shareholders may balk at a significant increase in spending on safety. After the San Bruno explosion, PG&E invested in improving safety practices and did not increase its dividend for six years. As a result, PG&E\u2019s stock price stagnated, frustrating investors.Read more about PG&E and its bankruptcy filingWho Wins and Who Loses From PG&E\u2019s BankruptcyJan. 29, 2019PG&E\u2019s Bankruptcy Filing Creates \u2018a Real Mess\u2019 for Rival InterestsJan. 29, 2019PG&E Bankruptcy Tests Who Will Pay for California WildfiresJan. 14, 2019As Fires Ravaged California, Utilities Lobbied Lawmakers for ProtectionJan. 5, 2019Will PG&E continue in its current form?PG&E could emerge from bankruptcy smaller than it is today. Other companies might want to buy parts of the utility, like its gas operation. State officials might welcome such a move because a smaller utility could be easier to manage and regulate.Elected officials, consumer groups and others have also suggested breaking up the company\u2019s electricity business into smaller utilities, some of which could be owned by local governments. Officials in San Francisco, for example, are considering buying PG&E\u2019s operations in their city and creating a municipally owned utility. Los Angeles, Sacramento and other California cities already operate their own electricity utilities. PG&E\u2019s board said last month that it was \u201creviewing structural options to best position PG&E to implement necessary changes while meeting customer and operational needs.\u201dBut selling off the most attractive parts of PG&E may leave behind the operations that have problems or operate in areas that are prone to wildfires.\u201cThe big concern is what happens if people get to cherry-pick the lowest-cost, highest-revenue portions of the electrical grid and leave behind the high-risk, high-cost areas,\u201d said Mark Toney, executive director of the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based consumer group.

It develops products for software engineers and project managers, with hits like Jira (for software project management and bug tracking) and Fisheye (a revision-control browser). And who could forget Confluence (an enterprise knowledge management system)?So why are its two founders household names in Australia?Because Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes, both 39, are the country\u2019s first start-up-to-I.P.O. tech billionaires. And because in the last year, they have started to make noise.Until recently, they largely stayed out of the public eye, even as Atlassian grew to become a $20 billion company. Now, as Australian politics tilt toward the right on global issues like immigration, cybersecurity and climate change, they are emerging as new political voices, getting in Twitter spats and lobbying Parliament.The other reason they are now household names: In 2017, Mr. Farquhar bought the most expensive home in Australia, a historic Sydney estate that sold for 73 million Australian dollars, or $52 million.In December, Mr. Cannon-Brookes broke that record when he closed on the house next door.Money and ResponsibilityI met the Atlassian founders for a few days in Sydney. Over brunches, a ferry ride and a birthday party, they told me about their new roles in public life, and what it feels like to be the first tech billionaires in a country where wealth usually comes from mining or banking.\u201cPeople are interested now in what we\u2019re saying,\u201d Mr. Cannon-Brookes said. \u201cWe have a voice. We have a sense of responsibility.\u201dThe two met as undergraduates at the University of New South Wales, where both were in a business scholarship program sponsored by Australian companies. They were encouraged to join one of those companies after graduating, but instead the two friends founded Atlassian, shocking their teachers and friends.It was 2002. Doing a start-up was unusual.\u201cIt was disbelief, really \u2014 why would you not go with a sponsor company?\u201d said Christine Van Toorn, the program\u2019s director and a lecturer at the school.They relied on credit cards for initial financing.

The company\u2019s founders have lobbied against immigration restrictions that they say make it harder to recruit.CreditMatthew Abbott for The New York Times\u201cSometimes we try the front door, sometimes we need to blow up the side door,\u201d Mr. Cannon-Brookes said of their political activities.Lobbying for ChangeBoth became more interested in Australian politics after policies took a sharp turn toward the parochial, with the governing coalition abandoning efforts to address climate change and stoking fears around immigration.That presented a problem for a company that needs to hire talented engineers, often from abroad. And so initially, the founders\u2019 main goal was basic: to make Australia more tech-friendly and its politicians more tech-aware.First, they hosted a coding class for elected officials and started working to get engineering into more curriculums.\u201cIt was like organizing the world\u2019s worst wedding,\u201d Mr. Cannon-Brookes said.Still, it earned them some respect. \u201cThey do some wonderfully creative things,\u201d said Julie Bishop, who was deputy leader of the Liberal Party from 2007 to 2018. \u201cMike and Scott have an enormously influential role to play.\u201dAustralia just passed Switzerland as the richest country in the world as measured by household median wealth, and Mr. Cannon-Brookes thinks its reliance on mineral wealth has made the country slower to make tech investment or long-term economic change a priority.Mr. Cannon-Brookes is especially passionate about climate change. As Prime Minister Scott Morrison has walked back Australia\u2019s renewable energy ambitions, Mr. Cannon-Brookes has become a staunch critic.\u201cYou\u2019ve made me mad & inspired me,\u201d he told the prime minister on Twitter, adding an expletive for emphasis.Along with goading Elon Musk to bring Australia the world\u2019s largest battery to help solve its power problems, Mr. Cannon-Brookes has been gathering others in the Australian business community to push Canberra. Peter Dutton, the home affairs minister, has told the Atlassian founders to \u201cstick to their knitting.\u201d\u201cHis knitting is running the country well, and he doesn\u2019t seem to be doing it,\u201d Mr. Cannon-Brookes said.He personally invests in alternative fuel and food sources, and he is especially interested in controlled-environment agriculture. \u201cMy wife and I have a big belief in the future of insects as a food source,\u201d Mr. Cannon-Brookes said over brunch (granola, not insects).ImageAn employee at Atlassian\u2019s headquarters.CreditMatthew Abbott for The New York TimesMr. Farquhar tends to focus on the issues aligned with Atlassian\u2019s fortunes: cybersecurity (he says the new encryption law has cost the company customers) and immigration (he argues that the government is hurting recruitment and innovation by aiming to cut Australia\u2019s immigration intake).It is not at all clear whether he can influence the encryption law; potential amendments are due to be debated in Parliament this week, and no changes are expected.But on immigration, Atlassian\u2019s founders have moved the needle. After Australia\u2019s skilled worker program cut several technology roles (including web developer) from its approved visa categories, Mr. Farquhar and Mr. Cannon-Brookes lobbied Parliament to change course and add more opportunities for international recruitment.Neighbors Needing the Wider WorldOn a ferry ride to work, Mr. Farquhar pointed out the two founders\u2019 houses, huge estates set into the lush Sydney hillside. Before they bought the properties, plans had been made to tear down the houses and develop the lots.Mr. Cannon-Brookes and his family moved in a few weeks ago. He and Mr. Farquhar created a hole in the fence so their children could play together. One day a week, the founders pick up their children at school together and take the ferry home.\u201cIt\u2019s a changing of the guard,\u201d Mr. Farquhar said, referring to the houses. \u201cThey were owned by two newspaper families. It used to be newspaper dynasties, and now it\u2019s technology dynasties.\u201dIt was a symbolically significant transition. The Fairfax family, a newspaper dynasty, had owned the properties since 1901.\u201cIt was an establishment family, a very conservative family, very committed members of the Congregational Church, and they were mainstays of Sydney\u2019s exclusive eastern suburbs,\u201d said Bridget Griffen-Foley, a professor of media at Macquarie University in Sydney. \u201cSo it\u2019s quite symbolic that the fortunes of the old media dynasty have been so affected by digital disruption, and now you\u2019ve got tech billionaires taking over.\u201dImageMr. Cannon-Brookes, left, and Mr. Farquhar on a ferry in Sydney Harbor. \u201cPeople are interested now in what we\u2019re saying,\u201d Mr. Cannon-Brookes said. \u201cWe have a voice.\u201dCreditMatthew Abbott for The New York TimesThis is a big change for Australia, where software entrepreneurs do not have the kind of cultural sway they have in the United States and elsewhere.\u201cMost of the mansions owned by the neighbors are offshore billionaires or really old Australian money \u2014 mineral money, gold rush money,\u201d said Mr. Jones, the venture capitalist. \u201cIt\u2019s been 100 years since most of the families on Sydney Harbor made their money.\u201dMoney notwithstanding, running a growing tech company in Australia is a challenge, the founders said. Recruitment is hard. Two-thirds of Atlassian\u2019s work force is in San Francisco.The founders have formed a cohort of friends with big tech companies outside Silicon Valley, including Daniel Ek, the Swedish chief executive of Spotify, and Ryan Smith of Qualtrics, who is based in Utah.\u201cWe\u2019ve got all the same problems,\u201d Mr. Cannon-Brookes said.And so every two years the Atlassian founders have hosted a private retreat, inviting every Australian start-up valued over $100 million, which is about a dozen. They hike and fish. Families are invited. The goal is to encourage camaraderie and share best practices.It is one of many reasons the two men say they would not leave Australia for Silicon Valley.\u201cI know the U.S. very well, and I know Australia very well,\u201d Mr. Farquhar said. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve got it better here.\u201d"}, {"title": "Former Senior Apple Lawyer Charged With Insider Trading", "category": "Business", "id": "fa188a7c-9651-4db3-b8f8-d07f3b38a32f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/technology/apple-insider-trading.html", "publishdate": 20190213, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/business/14apple1/merlin_141089919_3866749d-fea5-450e-9283-afc06df1352e-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A former senior lawyer at Apple who oversaw the company\u2019s insider trading policies was himself accused of insider trading by federal prosecutors and securities regulators in complaints made public on Wednesday.The Securities and Exchange Commission said in a suit that Gene Levoff, a former senior director of corporate law and a corporate secretary at Apple, repeatedly traded on inside information from 2011 to 2016.The S.E.C. said Mr. Levoff violated insider trading laws three times from 2015 to 2016. On one occasion, Mr. Levoff sold roughly $10 million of Apple stock \u2014 nearly his entire holdings \u2014 from his personal brokerage account four days before Apple announced quarterly earnings on July 21, 2015.In a related action, federal prosecutors in New Jersey charged Mr. Levoff with one count of securities fraud in a criminal complaint.The company\u2019s stock price fell 4 percent after the earnings report, in which Apple revealed it had fallen short of analysts\u2019 estimates for iPhone sales.Mr. Levoff had already seen a draft of the announcement and avoided about $345,000 in losses by dumping his Apple shares before the official announcement, the S.E.C. said. But since the end of 2016, Apple\u2019s share price has increased 47 percent.Kevin Marino, Mr. Levoff\u2019s lawyer and a principal at the law firm Marino, Tortorella & Boyle, said he was reviewing the allegations against Mr. Levoff and looked forward to defending him.\u201cGene Levoff was a trusted Apple executive for many years, and has never before been accused of wrongdoing of any kind,\u201d Mr. Marino said in a statement.According to the S.E.C., Mr. Levoff oversaw Apple\u2019s corporate law group of 20 to 30 lawyers and paralegals. He was responsible for Apple\u2019s compliance with securities laws and providing legal advice for the company\u2019s S.E.C. filings and financial reporting. He also served as a corporate officer of every major Apple subsidiary.\u201cAs a member of the core group of senior Apple insiders entrusted with material nonpublic information, and as an attorney with a sophisticated understanding of securities and corporate law, Levoff knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that he had a duty of trust and confidence to the company and its shareholders,\u201d according to the complaint filed in United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.The S.E.C. said he was placed on leave in July and fired in September.\u201cAfter being contacted by authorities last summer, we conducted a thorough investigation with the help of outside legal experts, which resulted in termination,\u201d an Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, said in a statement.In an indication of how senior Mr. Levoff was at the company, he was part of Apple\u2019s disclosure committee \u2014 a group that helps Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, and Luca Maestri, the chief financial officer, determine whether the company is meeting its responsibilities for providing accurate and timely disclosures to investors.At the time of his departure, Mr. Levoff reported to Katherine Adams, Apple\u2019s general counsel. She replaced Bruce Sewell, who served as the company\u2019s top lawyer for eight years until he stepped down in 2017.Mr. Levoff was responsible for ensuring compliance with Apple\u2019s insider trading rules, including sending emails to individuals who were subject to trading restrictions around Apple\u2019s quarterly earnings announcements. Apple\u2019s insider trading policy said any individual with material, nonpublic information about the company was not allowed to trade the stock until 60 hours after that information had been announced.The S.E.C. said Mr. Levoff also engaged in insider trading on three other occasions from 2011 to 2012. In each instance, Mr. Levoff received draft news releases and S.E.C. filings. He then bought thousands of shares of Apple stock before the public announcement. Shortly after the stock rose on the positive earnings announcements, Mr. Levoff sold the shares. He made approximately $245,000 in profits on those insider trading transactions.Before those transactions, Mr. Levoff sent emails to company employees alerting them that a blackout period was starting and that they were prohibited from trading Apple securities."}, {"title": "Confidence in the Economy Has Faded.

And the Conference Board\u2019s index of consumer confidence posted its steepest decline over the past few months since 2011.Those three indexes had jumped in the months after Donald J. Trump was elected president on optimism that his pro-business agenda of reduced taxes and regulation would ignite economic growth. The indexes peaked last year as the stock market marched to record highs, and despite the recent pullback, they remain at historically elevated levels.Businesses, policymakers and investors often use sentiment surveys to evaluate the direction of the economy. If confidence is high, the thinking goes, business owners and consumers are more likely to open their wallets to make purchases, hire employees and expand their operations. If those same groups are worried about the future, they are more likely to curtail their spending.But upward swings in sentiment do not necessarily translate into increased spending and economic growth. The economy, for instance, remained sluggish for more than a year after consumer and business confidence jumped in the months after the 2016 election.Such indexes are also sensitive to short-term moves in the stock market and political developments that have little effect on spending.Indications that sentiment is set to rebound are beginning to appear. Economic confidence recovered in a poll conducted in early February for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey.The University of Michigan releases a preliminary version of its survey roughly halfway through each month and then its final report at the end. Last month, the final figure, although the lowest since October 2016, showed a slight uptick from the preliminary version, which was released during the shutdown. Also, the survey\u2019s personal financial expectations index, considered a better indicator of household spending than the overall index, held up during the period.The university will release its preliminary consumer sentiment index for February on Friday.The report on small-business sentiment also offered reasons to think the slide in confidence may be temporary. Within the index, expectations among business owners about their sales and the overall economy had the biggest declines. But those segments typically have been the most sensitive to gyrations in the stock markets.Meanwhile, expectations for business spending, which had slid sharply since August, stopped declining."}, {"title": "How to Make a 3-D Model of Your Home Renovation Vision", "category": "Business", "id": "d313928e-6e0a-439a-b495-c36e1f706c13", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/technology/personaltech/3d-home-renovation-apps.html", "publishdate": 20190213, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/technology/personaltech/14TECHTIP_TOP_PLANNER_5D/14TECTIP_TOP-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Got a bunch of home-improvement dreams but you\u2019re not quite sure where to start? Let a free or inexpensive three-dimensional floor plan program be your guide. While making a 3-D model is no substitute for professionally crafted plans and blueprints, it will give you a way to experiment with ideas before you hire a contractor or an architect. And some programs are simple to use: If you can use a tape measure and drag objects on a computer screen, you have the necessary skills. Here\u2019s how to get started.Step 1: Take a Measured ApproachYou\u2019ll need all the measurements of the room or project area in order to recreate it. A locking 25-foot retractable tape measure is the time-tested tool, but you can also get rough estimates with augmented-reality tools like Google\u2019s free Measure app for Android or Apple\u2019s similarly named iOS 12 Measure app. Some apps, like Magicplan for Android and iOS (prices start at $3), can do both the measurements and put together a floor plan.ImageApple\u2019s Measure app uses augmented-reality technology to detect the rough dimensions of objects, but using a good old-fashioned tape measure is more precise.CreditThe New York TimesMeasure everything: the length, width and depth of the walls, doors and windows in the space, and don\u2019t forget fixtures like radiators. You should also grab the dimensions of the furniture, appliances and other items in the renovation zone. If you plan to buy furniture, appliances or shelving, collect the measurements from the product\u2019s specifications online (or on the box).Step 2: Find Friendly SoftwareYou can find plenty of home-design apps in a range of prices in your app store. And some retailer apps, like those from Build.com and Wayfair, use augmented reality to show virtual objects like furniture in a room. But if this is all new to you \u2014 or if you\u2019re adding on a room \u2014 the free edition of Sweet Home 3D for Windows, Mac and Linux computers may be your best bet, because you get an intuitive interface and many design options. The application has many appealing features for beginners, including an illustrated user guide and video tutorials. (A full version of Sweet Home 3D with more design options is also available for less than $15 in the Microsoft and Mac App stores.)Sweet Home 3D has a free online edition that works in a web browser. SketchUp Free is another browser-based drawing program and has paid versions. ImageIf you are new to free 3-D drawing programs, check out any included help guides, tutorials or forums to make sure the software is right for you.CreditThe New York TimesPlanner 5D has free versions for Android and iOS that give you plenty of room to play before you need to start making any in-app purchases. The program also works on Windows 10, macOS and the web.Step 3: Lay Out a Floor PlanNext, make a scale model within the program\u2019s work space, which typically looks like a grid of squares representing feet or meters. Refer to your list of measurements and use the program\u2019s tools and grid to create walls, rooms, doors and the other central elements.ImageWith Sweet Home 3D or whatever design program you choose, use the room measurements you collected to sketch out the space you plan to remodel.CreditThe New York TimesIf drawing a room from scratch intimidates you at first, check your program to see if it includes templates or sample files. With a little clicking and dragging, you can usually modify these examples to match the outline and measurements of your own room.Step 4: Add Interior FurnishingsAfter you map out the room\u2019s exterior dimensions, start filling in the interior with furniture and appliances. Most design apps have an object browser window you can use to drag 3-D models of common items (like tables, sofas and bar carts) into your floor plan where you want them to go. More stylish furnishings may require an in-app purchase.ImageMost free apps \u2014 including Planner 5D, shown here \u2014 offer a few basic objects to put in your design, but you may need to buy the ones you really want with an in-app purchase.CreditThe New York TimesDepending on your software, you may also be able to select different window and door designs, as well as stylized wallpaper, flooring, curtains and other furnishings to make your model look as close to your renovation dream as possible.Step 5: See It in 3-D \u2014 and ShareSome apps provide a split-screen view between the 2-D floor plan and a 3-D model that you can spin and rotate. Other programs display the project in the flat 2-D view and you add the extra dimension with a tap or click. Seeing your room in 3-D can give you a better idea of how everything works within the space, and can highlight issues you may not have seen on the flat floor plan, like fire sprinklers that block cabinet doors from fully opening.ImageAs shown in Sweet Home 3D, you can even create detailed floor plans and models of an entire apartment if you\u2019re really ambitious.CreditThe New York TimesWhen you\u2019re satisfied with your creation, move on to the next phase.

After all, he ran marathons, followed a healthy diet and never had an inkling of any medical troubles during previous annual physicals.\u201cI went to the doctor, got about six minutes with a nurse practitioner, an insulin pen, a prescription and a pat on the back, and I was out the door,\u201d Mr. Dachis said. \u201cI was terrified. I had no idea what this condition was about or how to address it.\u201dFeeling confused and scared, he decided to leverage his expertise in digital marketing, technology and big data analytics to create a company, One Drop, that helps diabetics understand and manage their disease.The One Drop system combines sensors, an app, and a Bluetooth glucose meter to track and monitor a diabetic\u2019s blood glucose levels, food, exercise and medication. It uses artificial intelligence to predict the person\u2019s blood glucose level over the next 24 hours and even suggests ways the person can control fluctuations, such as walking or exercising to offset high sugar levels \u2014 or eating a candy bar to raise low glucose levels. Users can also text a diabetes coach with questions in real time.With 30 million Americans living with diabetes, Mr. Dachis said he knew the potential market for his technology was big. Indeed, more than one million people have downloaded the app to date, he said.One Drop is among a surging number of companies that are using \u201cinternet of things,\u201d also known as IoT, technology to create new treatments in the health care sector.\u201cAdvances like robotics, nanotechnology, genetic engineering, 3-D printing, artificial intelligence, and IoT are fueling an exciting era within health care innovation,\u201d said Jeff Becker, a senior analyst and health care I.T. expert at Forrester. \u201cMany of these efforts will undoubtedly fall flat, but some could end up as transformative as the X-ray itself.\u201dAnd consumers are paying attention.About 79 percent of consumers surveyed in the United States said technology is important to managing their health, according to a 2019 report by Accenture.The latest tech-related medical treatment advances run the gamut from implants that help paralyzed people walk to smart pills that detect when patients fail to take their medication.ImageOne Drop uses sensors, an app, and a Bluetooth glucose meter to track and monitor a patient\u2019s blood glucose levels, food, exercise and medication.CreditNathan Bajar for The New York TimesSpinal cord research took a major step forward when a 29-year-old man, who had been paralyzed from the chest down since a snowmobile accident in 2013, was able to walk the distance of a football field with the help of a rolling walker. The milestone, which was published in Nature Medicine last fall, came after a team of researchers at the Mayo Clinic implanted an epidural electrical stimulator device into the man's lower spine and gave him six months of intensive physical therapy.\u201cThis is a revolutionary breakthrough,\u201d said Kendall Lee, a neurosurgeon and director of neural engineering laboratories at the Mayo Clinic. He said the device had so far been successfully implanted in two people.While the implant isn\u2019t a cure, it offers hope to millions of paralyzed people around the world. But Dr. Lee was careful to note that the technology is still some time away from being publicly available.\u201cWe were able to do the study under the F.D.A.\u2019s investigational device exemption,\u201d Dr. Lee said. \u201cThis is not something for the general population yet.\u201dAt least three different research groups \u2014 Mayo Clinic, University of Louisville and the University of California, Los Angeles \u2014 are now aggressively expanding their trials to include more patients.Then there\u2019s the smart pill. The World Health Organization estimated that 50 percent of people with chronic diseases in developed countries fail to take their medicines as prescribed, whether from forgetfulness, concern about side effects or other reasons.This noncompliance costs the health care system in the United States from $100 billion to $290 billion a year from emergency room visits, hospital stays and other costs related to worsening medical conditions, according to the Network for Excellence in Health Innovation.AdhereTech built a smart pill bottle that alerts patients when it\u2019s time to take a medication and sends an automated text or phone message if they miss a dose in real time. But it only tracks the use and contents of the bottle, so there\u2019s no definitive way to detect whether a person has actually swallowed the pill.The pharmaceutical maker Otsuka goes a step further: It worked with Proteus Digital Health to create a digital smart pill for Otsuka\u2019s Abilify medication, which is used to treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. The Abilify MyCite pill, which will be rolled out in the next few months, is embedded with a sensor that\u2019s activated by stomach acids. The sensor is tracked by a patch worn on the person\u2019s stomach, which then sends the information to a smartphone app, where the patient and doctor can track when the medication was taken \u2014 and even send notifications if it hasn\u2019t.ImageJered Chinnock, who damaged his spinal cord in 2013, was able to walk with assistance after a team at the Mayo Clinic implanted an electrical device into his lower spine.CreditTeresa Crawford/Associated PressBut the technology goes far beyond pill-taking reminders, said Andrew Thompson, co-founder, president and chief executive of Proteus Digital Health. The sensor patch also tracks physical activity, heart rate, rest patterns and other metrics, which will help doctors and patients know whether a medication is working and the right dose has been prescribed.The Abilify MyCite pill doesn\u2019t come cheap: It will cost $1,650 a month, significantly more than the $30-to-$40-a-month cost of a generic version of the Abilify pill. However, most patients would only take the digital pill for two to three months \u2014 just enough time to collect data on pill-taking adherence, dosage and health impact to revise a treatment plan, Andrew Wright, Otsuka\u2019s vice president of Digital Medicine, said.Efforts are now underway for both Proteus and Otsuka to add the technology to pills for other chronic conditions. Mr. Thompson believes it\u2019s the future.\u201cYears from now your grandchildren or your children will be incredulous that you put things into your body and didn\u2019t know if they were real or fake, the right dose or the wrong dose, in-date or out-of-date,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cSo yes, eventually this will be in every drug everywhere.\u201dIn the world of prosthetics, scientists have found a way for tetraplegics \u2014 those paralyzed from the neck down \u2014 to feel touch by electrically stimulating parts of the brain. Paralysis can mean the loss of both control and feeling in affected areas, and while prosthetics can return motor function, sensing requires treatment of the nervous system itself.Initially, the challenge seemed daunting, considering the brain contains 100 billion neurons, and matching up the neurons that control sensory nerves with the prosthetic hands and arms was tough, said Sliman Bensmaia, an associate professor in the department of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago, who was part of the research team. But after surgically placing an electrode implant into the brain, the team was able to electrically stimulate the portions of the brain that controlled sensation, allowing the patient to feel the size, shape and texture of objects and to tell when a finger was touched.Plans are now in the works to expand human trials at the University of Pittsburgh, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Chicago. The biggest challenge now? Making the brain implant wireless and upgrading it so that it doesn\u2019t wear out after five years.\u201cYou can\u2019t be having brain surgery every few years,\u201d Dr. Bensmaia said. \u201cWe need an array or implant technology that lasts a lifetime.\u201dDr. Bensmaia said the brain implant technology could someday have far-reaching applications, such as improving memory or retrieving information faster.ImageThe Abilify MyCite digital pill uses a \u201csmart\u201d pill and a sensor patch so that doctors and patients can track dosage times and get notifications if the medication is working.Another hot area: The use of 3-D printers to create patient-specific medical devices, like knee joints and spinal implants. The printers make it faster, easier and cheaper to make customized medical devices based on a patient\u2019s M.R.I. and C.T. scans.\u201cThey can be made in one-fifth to one-tenth\u201d of the time that traditional custom-made devices are made, said Scott Hollister, a professor in the department of biomedical engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University. And 3-D printed devices often fit far better, cause fewer complications and require a shorter recovery period than off-the-shelf joint replacements that come in sizes small, medium and large.At least 80 3-D-printed devices have received F.D.A. approval as of 2016, although their use has largely been confined to academic and research hospitals.While many of these breakthrough technologies have shown promise in clinical trials, experts caution there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll ever make it to market.Mr. Becker, the Forrester analyst, cited the disastrous example of Theranos, which made false claims for years that it had a revolutionary blood-testing technology that only required a small amount of blood. The company raised more than $700 million, was valued at $9 billion at its peak in 2014, and made its founder Elizabeth Holmes a billionaire, before collapsing after scientists and regulators discovered the technology didn\u2019t work.\u201cTheranos is the pockmark of health care I.T.,\u201d Mr. Becker said.But sometimes it\u2019s not malicious \u2014 it\u2019s just promising science that doesn\u2019t pan out.In 2014, the Google X lab, now called Verily, unveiled news \u2014 with much fanfare \u2014 that it was developing a smart contact lens that could monitor blood glucose levels in real-time by measuring tear fluid in the eye. The company\u2019s partner on the project, Novartis, said it expected to have the device on store shelves within five years.\u201cThis was huge news \u2014 the holy grail of life sciences \u2014 it was something that everybody wanted to be the first to bring to market,\u201d Mr. Becker said.But then, \u201cwe all waited for updates and nothing came \u2014 just radio silence.\u201d Last November, the company announced that the project had been scrapped because of inconsistent testing results.\u201cSo, clearly the science wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Mr. Becker said. \u201cThey prematurely announced it, got excited about it, they made a big splash, and it was all for naught.\u201d"}, {"title": "Little Red App: Xi\u2019s Thoughts Are (Surprise!) a Hit in China", "category": "Business", "id": "7740f58e-e981-4757-ab56-9adf1bfb6a51", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/technology/china-communist-app.html", "publishdate": 20190214, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/15/world/15Xi-app-1/15Xi-app-1-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 Call it the Little Red App.Part social platform, part indoctrination tool, a new smartphone app called Study the Great Nation is the latest effort by the Chinese Communist Party to bring its propaganda initiatives into the mobile age. So far, it seems to be working. Study the Great Nation recently became the most downloaded app on Apple\u2019s app store in China, and on several app stores that cater to phones running Android as well. Not all of the enthusiasm appears to have arisen organically, however. Since the app\u2019s release at the beginning of the year, Communist Party branches at universities and local governments have arranged for administrators to guide and monitor party members as they use the app for political education, according to announcements on official websites.Study the Great Nation, which was produced by the central government\u2019s Publicity Department, has polish and sheen enough to match any of China\u2019s popular news and entertainment apps. Most of those apps are not focused so narrowly, however, on all things Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s leader. In Study the Great Nation, you can catch up on the latest state media reports on Mr. Xi\u2019s decisions, savor a quote of the day from Mr. Xi or brush up on \u201cXi Jinping Thought.\u201d You can quiz yourself on Mr. Xi\u2019s policies and pronouncements, or take in a television show called \u201cXi Time,\u201d which is \u2026 well, you get the picture. Doing each of these activities can reward users with \u201cstudy points,\u201d which can be redeemed for gifts in future versions of the app. Other sections of the app allow you to organize your calendar, manage your to-do list and schedule events. Is there a social element? Of course there is. Study the Great Nation is integrated with DingTalk, a messaging app made by the e-commerce giant Alibaba. As a result, you can call or text your friends in the app, host video hangouts and even send messages that disappear, Snapchat-style, after they are read. Over the past few years, the Communist Party has deployed patriotic rap songs, slickly produced talk shows and quirky smartphone games to try to hook Chinese youths on its ideology and teachings. It is not always easy to tell how such efforts are received, and whether they merely come across as forced. Ratings and reviews for Study the Great Nation are currently disabled in Apple\u2019s app store. But App Annie, an analytics firm, has preserved 497 reviews that had been submitted to Apple\u2019s store as of Tuesday. They are not kind, by and large. Many are laced with dry sarcasm. The average rating is 2.7 stars out of five. \u201cEverybody is installing this app voluntarily,\u201d wrote one reviewer who gave the app one star. \u201cNobody is forcing us.\u201d \u201cThis software is great,\u201d another one-star review said. \u201cI downloaded it completely voluntarily.

It consistently ranks atop lists of Americans\u2019 favorite brands, and its obsessive focus on customer satisfaction has created a generation of consumers who can\u2019t imagine shopping anywhere else.Amazon is also overwhelmingly popular in New York, where polls have consistently shown that a majority of city residents supported the company\u2019s planned Queens expansion.But happy customers don\u2019t necessarily translate to political power.[Read more on Amazon\u2019s decision to pull its planned New York headquarters.]Amazon acted as though its popularity \u2014 and its early support from key politicians, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2014 would clear a path to political concessions. But the company miscalculated the power of local organizers, who turned what might have been a straightforward construction project into an all-out political brawl. Amazon was caught flat-footed by the opposition, and belatedly mounted a charm campaign, taking out full-page newspaper ads and sending mailers to Queens residents in support of the deal.In the end, confronted with a choice between fighting and fleeing, Amazon packed its bags.\u201cThis is a case of significant political malpractice, more than anything else,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and former campaign manager for Mayor Michael Bloomberg.Mr. Tusk, who now acts as a \u201cfixer\u201d for technology companies looking to break into regulated markets, said that Amazon\u2019s response to local opposition was a tone-deaf misstep.\u201cAmazon did not understand the local politics on the ground at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just took Cuomo\u2019s word for it that everyone would be supportive.\u201dAmazon, which says it still plans to expand in Northern Virginia and Nashville as originally planned, blamed a small but vocal minority for sabotaging the deal.\u201cWhile polls show that 70 percent of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project,\u201d the company said in a statement.Local business leaders echoed that criticism.\u201cNew Yorkers wanted Amazon to come. The people who live in Queens wanted Amazon to come,\u201d said Julie Samuels, the executive director of Tech:NYC, a nonprofit organization that represents the city\u2019s tech industry. \u201cA handful of politicians got in the way.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. de Blasio characterized Amazon as a thin-skinned weakling, saying in a statement that \u201cyou have to be tough to make it in New York City.\u201dThis fight echoed the political drama surrounding two other tech companies that had difficulty breaking into city politics: Uber and Airbnb, which faced early political opposition despite broad popularity with customers.Several years ago, in response to a regulatory crackdown that threatened to crush its business model, Uber built a political war machine, hiring armies of lobbyists and political consultants \u2014 including Mr. Tusk \u2014 to make its case to officials across the country. It enlisted users, too, putting customized icons inside their Uber apps and urging them to petition City Hall for a reprieve. Airbnb used the same tactics, mobilizing its users in the cities where it faced restrictive regulations.Amazon certainly knows how to fight. Last year, it successfully lobbied to kill a proposed business tax in Seattle that would have raised about $50 million a year for affordable housing and other programs.It could have mounted a similar campaign in New York. Or it could have taken a page out of the Uber and Airbnb playbook, urging Amazon Prime members in New York to contact their representatives and agitate for a deal.Instead, the company did its lobbying in private, preferring back-room negotiations to a noisy, public-facing campaign.\u201cThey failed to appreciate that this market was different than the others,\u201d Mr. Tusk said.\u201cThey didn\u2019t do their homework.\u201dFor Uber and Airbnb, of course, the stakes of political success were existential. Amazon\u2019s size and market dominance have given it the ability to walk away from even a multibillion-dollar deal relatively painlessly. New Yorkers will still buy their toilet paper and dog food from Amazon, even if the company doesn\u2019t have an office in Long Island City.Some New Yorkers who supported Amazon\u2019s expansion plans may consider the company\u2019s retreat proof of the shortsightedness of politicians.\u201cI hope there will be real lessons learned here,\u201d Ms. Samuels of Tech:NYC said. \u201cThey were playing with fire, and look what happened.\u201dBut this should be a teachable moment for Amazon, too.For years, the company succeeded wildly by catering to shoppers, and betting \u2014 mostly correctly \u2014 that its sterling customer reputation would insulate it from criticism over its labor practices, anti-union resistance and other corporate shortcomings.But that era may be over. In New York, at least, there are some problems that low prices and two-day shipping can\u2019t fix."}, {"title": "German Growth Stagnates as Trump Trade War Starts to Bite", "category": "Business", "id": "1494688a-280b-4a45-99c0-6d43f71d043e", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/business/germany-economy.html", "publishdate": 20190214, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/15/business/15germanecon-print/merlin_135244701_8c953a86-25bc-44e1-9715-5a441ae9c867-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "FRANKFURT \u2014 The once seemingly unstoppable German economy had the slowest growth of any eurozone country except Italy at the end of 2018, according to data published on Thursday that brought the impact of President Trump\u2019s trade war into stark relief.Germany\u2019s economy did not grow at all in the year\u2019s final quarter, and it barely avoided sliding into recession, the government statistics agency said.One reason for the slowdown was conflict over trade. American tariffs are hurting German steel makers\u2019 sales, and Germany is also experiencing collateral damage caused by a trade war between China and the United States.The economic data was bad news for the rest of Europe. Germany has the region\u2019s largest economy, and it typically sets the pace for the rest of the eurozone. The country has often helped haul its neighbors through periods of crisis, but it may no longer be able to play that role.Germany\u2019s position in next-to-last place among European Union countries is also a blow to its prestige. When Greece, Spain and Portugal were in dire straits during the last decade, German leaders scolded them over their economic policies and high debt. The economies of those countries are now growing more quickly than Germany\u2019s, according to separate data published Thursday by the European Union statistics agency.German carmakers and other companies rely on sales in China, where growth has slowed partly as a result of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods. Volkswagen said Wednesday that its sales fell 3.4 percent in January compared with a year earlier in part because of weak demand in China, the carmaker\u2019s largest market.The fourth-quarter data released Thursday fell short of analysts\u2019 projections, but it was good enough to narrowly avert a recession. In the third quarter, German economic output had dipped 0.2 percent from the previous quarter. Another three months of declining output would have met the common definition of recession.Many economists expect the slowdown to continue. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d said Florian Hense, European economist at the German bank Berenberg. \u201cClearly this is not a two-quarter soft patch. It seems more serious.\u201dGermany\u2019s woes will add to the grave problems facing Italy, including weak banks, erratic politics and a looming credit crunch. Germany is the biggest customer for Italian exports.Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war has been weighing on European growth since early last year, but the effect was mostly psychological until recently. The uncertainty created by the administration\u2019s tariffs made manufacturers reluctant to expand factories or add workers.The tariffs\u2019 impact is becoming more tangible, cutting into the earnings of companies like Salzgitter, a steel maker in the German city of the same name. Salzgitter warned this month that pretax profit in 2019 would be half or less than the 347 million euros, or $391 million, that the company earned in 2018.American tariffs on steel imports are partly to blame, although mostly indirectly, said Bernhard Kleinermann, a Salzgitter spokesman. The levies caused producers in countries like Russia and Turkey to flood Europe with steel they could no longer sell to customers in the United States, driving down prices.Trade was not the only dead weight on Germany\u2019s growth. Britain\u2019s looming departure from the European Union, and the prospect that it might happen without an agreement covering future economic relations, was another significant source of anxiety.German carmakers struggled to comply with tougher emissions standards, which delayed delivery of new vehicles. Even an especially dry summer played a role. The level of the Rhine River fell so low that barge traffic became impossible, holding up shipments of German chemicals that normally travel by water.Those were temporary problems, though, making some economists optimistic that growth could improve in the coming months. The horizon will seem much brighter if Britain overcomes its political deadlock and works out a deal with Brussels, and if the United States and China can resolve their differences over trade.Economists also expect the Chinese government to stimulate the country\u2019s economy, which would help revive demand for German products like cars and machine tools.Although Germany has been flirting with recession, it hardly feels like an economy in crisis. At 3.3 percent, the country\u2019s unemployment rate is still the lowest in the eurozone. Consumers continue to spend, and businesses continue to invest.\u201cThe fundamentals of the economy are still so solid,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, said in an online video.Many things could still go wrong. Mr. Trump continues to threaten to impose tariffs on imported European cars, a move that would strike Germany particularly hard because of the outsize role the auto industry plays in the country\u2019s economy.\u201cAn escalation, in relations between the U.S.A. and China as well as between the U.S.A. and the E.U., is still possible,\u201d Gregor Eder, an economist at the insurer Allianz, said in a note to clients.

To qualify, a candidate must either reach 1 percent in three approved polls or raise money from at least 65,000 donors in 20 states, with at least 200 unique donors in each state. Each candidate\u2019s slot will be selected by a random drawing.The criteria will apply only to the first two debates, scheduled for back-to-back weeknights in June and July, allowing the committee to update its requirements as the field shifts. NBC News, MSNBC and Telemundo are sponsoring the first debate, and CNN will host the second, with specific dates and locations to be announced in the coming weeks.The 2020 Democratic Field Is the Largest in Modern HistorySee how the current Democratic presidential field compares with past cycles.In total, the committee expects to hold a dozen debates over the 2020 campaign cycle.\u201cBecause campaigns are won on the strength of their grass roots, we also updated the threshold, giving all types of candidates the opportunity to reach the debate stage and giving small-dollar donors a bigger voice in the primary than ever before,\u201d Tom Perez, the committee chairman, said in a statement.Small-dollar donations have emerged as a significant metric for assessing candidates\u2019 early strength, as some have disavowed \u201csuper PACs\u201d that allow for unlimited sums from wealthy backers. The new debate standard, the first to include small-dollar donations, is likely to intensify the pressure for candidates, particularly those with less name recognition, to quickly lock down donors.The new criteria are a direct response to criticism leveled during the 2016 campaign that the party committee organized the debate schedule to favor Hillary Clinton, the eventual party nominee. Her two primary opponents, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and the former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, accused the party\u2019s leadership of rigging the process by limiting the number of debates to six \u2014 two of which were scheduled for Saturday evenings and one for a Sunday. Eventually the committee sanctioned four more debates.The revised debate plan is one of several reforms undertaken by the D.N.C. to rebuild trust within the party after the 2016 elections. Last year, committee members voted to drastically curtail the power of so-called superdelegates \u2014 the elected officials, lobbyists and party activists who get to vote for a candidate during the party\u2019s nominating convention. The new rule bars superdelegates from voting on the first presidential nominating ballot at a contested national convention."}, {"title": "Europe\u2019s Middle Class Is Shrinking.

Now, after dropping her two young children at school, she boarded the subway to her desperately needed job as a secretary, working for just above minimum wage.Moments later, her husband, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Alvarez, walked out the door to a charcuterie where he is a self-employed butcher. The 56-year-old was once the human resources director of a Spanish plant nursery that downsized, laying off him and half the company\u2019s 300 workers in 12 months.After decades of living comfortably in Spain\u2019s upper middle class, the middle-aged couple are struggling with their decline. Spain\u2019s economy, like the rest of Europe\u2019s, is growing faster than before the 2008 financial crisis and creating jobs. But the work they could find pays a fraction of the combined 80,000-euro annual income they once earned.By summer, they figure they will no longer be able to pay their mortgage.\u201cWe\u2019re people who had worked our way up, and now we\u2019re tumbling down,\u201d Mrs. Navarro said, as tears sprang to her eyes. \u201cThe economy seems to be improving, but we\u2019re not benefiting.\u201dIt is a precarious situation felt by millions of Europeans.Since the recession of the late 2000s, the middle class has shrunk in over two-thirds of the European Union, echoing a similar decline in the United States and reversing two decades of expansion. While middle-class households are more prevalent in Europe than in the United States \u2014 around 60 percent, compared with just over 50 percent in America \u2014 they face unprecedented levels of vulnerability.ImageRaquel Navarro, Mr. Alvarez\u2019s wife, owned an events promotion company before the financial crisis. Now she works as a secretary, paid just above the minimum wage.CreditGianfranco Tripodo for The New York TimesFor people in this group, whom economists define as earning between two-thirds and double their country\u2019s median income, the risk of falling down the economic ladder is greater than their chances of moving up.\u201cThe progress of the middle class has halted in most European countries,\u201d said Daniel Vaughan-Whitehead, a senior economist at the International Labor Organization in Geneva. \u201cTheir situation has become more unstable, and if something happens in the household, they are more likely to go down and stay down.\u201dThe hurdles to keeping their status, or recovering lost ground, are higher given post-recession labor dynamics. The loss of middle-income jobs, weakened social protections and skill mismatches have reduced economic mobility and widened income inequality. Automation and globalization are deepening the divides.Europe\u2019s social safety nets have traditionally offered protection, but even these are being reduced as deficit-reduction policies required by the European Union kick in. That unraveling, in part, explains the populist discontent in Europe.\u201cPoliticians haven\u2019t created measures to help those of us in the middle get back on our feet, and we\u2019re a big group,\u201d said Mrs. Navarro, her frustration clear.\u201cWhat happened to me has happened to many people I know,\u201d she said, citing friends and neighbors who have confided their woes. \u201cWhen we get together, we call ourselves \u2018los invisibles\u2019 \u2014 the invisibles,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are the forgotten ones.\u201dOnce seen as a modelIn Spain, it seems as if this should not be happening. The country was feted by European policymakers as a model for the recovery, having tightened its belt to exit a deep recession. An overhaul, which included sweeping labor law changes in 2012 that gave employers more flexibility to fire and hire, helped revive the economy.ImageMr. Alvarez earns 1,000 euros a month, but taxes and social security eat up about two-thirds of that. Together, he and Mrs. Navarro once made \u20ac80,000 a year.CreditGianfranco Tripodo for The New York TimesSpain\u2019s economy grew faster than those of France and Germany last year, at a 3 percent annual pace. Unemployment fell last month to 14.4 percent, the lowest in a decade and down from a staggering 27 percent in 2013.But interviews with over a dozen workers revealed a deep-seated disillusionment with the recovery and the quality of jobs emerging from it.The changes in labor laws weakened job protections as well as earnings. With millions looking for work, employers could offer lower salaries, making it harder for people to regain or maintain living standards.Mrs. Navarro and her husband were among the better off. With degrees in law, management and business, she owned the events promotion company, employing around 50 people on and off for projects.In 2006, some of her clients suddenly stopped paying. Two years later, as the financial crisis hit, she had to close shop. She found a managerial job at a nonprofit foundation that paid \u20ac2,500 a month, less than before but enough to help maintain the family\u2019s lifestyle.Then the foundation went under in 2012 \u2014 the same year the labor legislation went into force. Mrs. Navarro could not find a new job. Because the foundation had required her to register as self-employed, a tactic that allows employers to avoid paying high social taxes, she received no unemployment compensation.Her husband lost his job the same year and collected unemployment benefits as he looked for work. He eventually took over a charcuterie stand once owned by Mrs. Navarro\u2019s father in a dimly lit produce market, becoming self-employed. But his sales are down because other Spaniards, too, are economizing. Mr. Alvarez now earns \u20ac1,000 a month but, after taxes and social security, takes home only about a third of that.ImageThe housing development, north of Madrid, where Mr. Alvarez and Mrs. Navarro live.CreditGianfranco Tripodo for The New York TimesMrs. Navarro spent several years sending out a stream of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, to no avail, while also caring full time for her two grade school children and an older daughter. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just difficult, it was almost impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cI got not one single interview.\u201dFinally, she was hired in 2017 for \u20ac1,200 a month at a trade association for entrepreneurs and small businesses. Though a secretary in title and in pay, she spends most of her time providing legal advice to struggling business owners.With their lower incomes, the couple are straining to pay household bills. Mrs. Navarro said she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d do when their savings dried up in a few months.\u201cMy father taught me to work hard, but he didn\u2019t teach me that life can just cut you down,\u201d she said.Worsening inequalityThe gap between people slipping toward the bottom and those at the top shows no sign of narrowing. Wealth divisions between Europe\u2019s lower- and middle-income families and upper-income households are at a record high, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.The median income for middle-class families also fell, especially in Southern Europe, eroding purchasing power and feeding discontent that has driven populist protests like the Yellow Vest movement in France. Political polarization is growing in Spain, where Vox, a right-wing nationalist party, recently won parliamentary seats in Andalusia, the country\u2019s biggest region.Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has taken heed. The Socialist leader grabbed power last summer with the fragile backing of Podemos, the left-wing anti-austerity party. Warning of middle-class frustrations, his embattled government ordered a 22 percent rise in the minimum wage in January, and has vowed to reverse some labor laws, increase social spending and raise taxes on companies and the rich. Spanish lawmakers rejected his budget on Wednesday, however, and on Friday Mr. S\u00e1nchez called a snap general election in April.ImageDavid Jim\u00e9nez of Madrid lost his job in 2017 as a senior electrician at the carmaker PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn.CreditGianfranco Tripodo for The New York TimesFor David Jim\u00e9nez and his partner, Raquel Murillo, the prime minister\u2019s efforts appeal to a sense of injustice. They recently moved to a tiny rental apartment in Madrid\u2019s outskirts. The couple\u2019s finances have worn dangerously thin after Mr. Jim\u00e9nez, 45, lost his job in 2017 as a senior electrician at the carmaker PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn.Over 24 years, he rose from the factory floor to become a quality control supervisor, netting \u20ac1,600 a month. Ms. Murillo, 47, earned \u20ac2,000 a month as a vocational teacher.

And when serious problems were discovered, the department rarely invoked its contractual right to dock servicers\u2019 pay, the department\u2019s inspector general said in its report.The result was a group of contractors that effectively regulated themselves, with no incentive to fix their repeated failures, the report concluded.Student loan servicers and Education Department officials pushed back against the audit\u2019s findings. In a written response included in the report, James F. Manning, the acting chief operating officer of the agency\u2019s Federal Student Aid office, said his department was dedicated to giving borrowers \u201cworld-class service\u201d and strongly disagreed with the report\u2019s conclusion.\u201cNeither your report nor any of these other extensive oversight efforts have identified material instances of noncompliance by our vendors,\u201d Mr. Manning wrote.The audit said that more than 60 percent of the agency\u2019s oversight reports from 2015 to late 2017 contained examples of servicers acting improperly. But when the agency\u2019s monitors found an error, they typically only required the servicer to fix it on that borrower\u2019s account, rather than checking to see if the problem affected others.And if servicers promised to fix errors, they were generally left out of a database the Education Department used to track mistakes, the audit found. The agency \u201crelied on the memories of the employees responsible for the oversight activities to recognize recurring instances of noncompliance,\u201d the report said.The Education Department can reduce servicers\u2019 pay because of mistakes, but it rarely did so. The $2 million the department fined its servicers in the last 17 months represented \u201cless than 0.12 percent of $1.7 billion that F.S.A. budgeted for its loan servicing contracts in 2018 and 2019,\u201d the report said.Among other problems, the audit found contractors made mistakes when informing borrowers about their payment options and in how they calculated payments for borrowers on income-based repayment plans.While the report covered a relatively recent period, it pointed out that many of the problems had lingered for years, echoing complaints of borrowers and other government auditors. A Government Accountability Office investigation last year revealed that a loan forgiveness program for public servants had rejected more than 99 percent of those who applied, largely because of mistakes and confusion in its implementation.That program\u2019s operator, the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency \u2014 also called FedLoan \u2014 is the department\u2019s largest servicer, handling more than $340 billion owed by eight million borrowers. It was singled out for particular criticism in the inspector general\u2019s report.On calls with borrowers that Education Department employees monitored in April 2017, FedLoan received a \u201cfail\u201d rating on nearly 11 percent, far more than any other large servicer. The average among all servicers that month was just over 4 percent.Keith New, a spokesman for FedLoan, said the inspector general\u2019s report had a \u201cstatistical imbalance,\u201d with a \u201cdisproportionately large\u201d number of FedLoan calls analyzed. Even so, he said, the company welcomes such analysis because it \u201c provides an opportunity to explore the root cause of possible issues, which leads to better outcomes for all borrowers.\u201dThe audit called out another large servicer, Navient. In May 2017 \u2014 four months after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sued Navient for what it called widespread servicing mistakes \u2014 the Education Department conducted a special review to investigate allegations that Navient had improperly steered borrowers toward forbearance to extend their repayment terms when they might have been better off with a different option.According to the audit, Navient offered the borrower no option other than forbearance on more than 9 percent of the reviewed calls. Instead of following up on that finding, the Education Department kept its report private and said publicly that Navient had done nothing improper.Navient said in its own public statement on the 2017 investigation that it had acted correctly and had \u201cexceptional\u201d results in most reviews. It echoed that on Thursday in response to the inspector general\u2019s report, which it said \u201crepeats the mistakes\u201d made in the 2017 review.Paul Hartwick, a company spokesman, said Navient would contact the inspector general\u2019s office \u201cto help them understand the facts.\u201dDespite his disagreement with the report\u2019s conclusions, Mr. Manning said the department had already implemented some of its recommendations. For example, it is working to fix problems in how some servicers handle forbearance requests and in how payments toward public service loan forgiveness are counted.The fieldwork in the audit report \u201cwas conducted nearly two years ago and does not accurately reflect the current state of our business operations,\u201d Liz Hill, an agency spokeswoman, said after the report was released.The report is likely to fuel efforts by some states to crack down on federal student loan servicers. Five state attorneys general have sued Navient. And Massachusetts is pursuing FedLoan over what officials there say are violations of state consumer protection laws. The Education Department is seeking to have some of those lawsuits dismissed, saying that it alone has the authority to oversee its contractors.\u201cThis report confirms what millions of families already know: student loan servicers are falling down on the job, and the U.S. Department of Education looks the other way,\u201d Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, said in a statement.The report infuriated some consumer advocates like Seth Frotman, a former student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who quit last year after complaining that the Trump administration was protecting lenders at borrowers\u2019 expense.\u201cThe rampant breakdowns and lack of accountability this shows should be Exhibit A as state legislators and state law enforcement officials demand justice for student loan borrowers,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "On Politics: Trump Moves Toward Border Deal", "category": "Politics", "id": "1796755c-b7ae-4c02-8e13-1f6f76b82f33", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/us/politics/trump-border-deal.html", "publishdate": 20190214, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Thursday morning.

But the era of ever larger jets, and the romantic idea of continent-hopping travel they inspired, came to an unofficial end with the announcement by Airbus on Thursday that it plans to cease production of the A380, the largest passenger airliner ever built.An engineering marvel expansive enough for showers and sleekly designed bars, the planes hark back to the age when flying had glamour. The four engines are powerful enough to reach cruising altitude in roughly 15 minutes, all the while keeping noise to a tolerable hum. There are fan clubs for the A380 on both Twitter and Facebook.But for years, the jet has been far more popular with passengers than airlines. When it debuted in 2005, the A380 was a bet that the future of air travel was big planes flying between major hubs, followed by connectors to final destinations.Instead, the dominant trend became smaller planes and direct flights. Dropping $445 million for a jet \u2014 the A380\u2019s list price \u2014 that can carry more than 500 people made little economic sense, especially as budget airlines cropped up as competition.Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, struggled to market the A380 for years and never sold one to an American carrier. Citing reduced orders from Emirates Airline, a major customer, and an inability to find other buyers, the company said it would halt deliveries of the jetliner in 2021. (It will continue to support existing A380s.)\u201cAs a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Tom Enders, said in a statement.When Airbus started developing the A380 about two decades ago, airport congestion was a rising concern. The company offered its supersized jet, a 6,000-square-foot double-decker, as a way to get more travelers on and off limited tarmac space. Airbus spent $25 billion developing the plane, which is about 50 percent larger than its nearest rival, Boeing\u2019s 747.But it turned out that the solution to congested airports was not larger planes. It was smaller planes at a wide variety of less crowded airports. Airlines reduced costs by offering direct flights on jets that were cheaper to maintain, in part because they were landing at airports with lower fees and in part because they were burning less gas.The A380 \u201cis an aircraft of a previous generation where fuel was not as big of an issue,\u201d said Frank Netscher, an analyst at Scope Group, a credit-rating company. \u201cIt\u2019s not by accident that all the new models will only have two engines, not four.\u201dThe age of the jumbo jet has been winding down for a while. Last year, Boeing\u2019s 747, the original mega-plane, with the iconic hump, took its last flight for an airline based in its home country, the United States.Competition had already shifted from the S.U.V.s of the sky to the sedans, with Airbus\u2019s more compact and flexible A350 going head to head against Boeing\u2019s 787, which can carry a little more than half the number of passengers as a 747.ImageAn Emirates Airbus A380 in New York. Demand for the enormous A380 fell as traffic began to shift to smaller, more regional airports.CreditMichael Nagle for The New York TimesTo Robert W. Mann, an airline consultant in Port Washington, N.Y., all of these developments seemed inevitable 15 years ago.\u201cIf you think of market size as a pyramid, there are zillions of markets at the bottom of the pyramid that have very small volume,\u201d Mr. Mann said. \u201cIf you look at why the 787 and A350 are so popular, they have better range, and better range at smaller market sizes. They can capitalize on those parts of the pyramid that you could never fly an A380 economically.\u201dThe plane\u2019s survival was ensured only by Emirates, which uses its home in Dubai as a hub for about 1,500 flights a week. Emirates was Airbus\u2019s biggest A380 customer, with a fleet of more than 100. The manufacturer was so dependent on the airline that it acknowledged in January 2018 that it might cancel production of the jet, barring an Emirates order. A few days later, Emirates asked for $16 billion worth of the planes.Since then, the airline has been buffeted by the same forces that have transformed the rest of the industry. Emirates decided to take delivery of just 14 more A380s over the next two years, while ordering 70 smaller aircraft that can serve smaller airports.\u201cWhile we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation,\u201d Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the chairman and chief executive of Emirates Airline and Group, said in a statement. \u201cFor us, the A380 is a wonderful aircraft loved by our customers and our crew. It is a differentiator for Emirates.\u201dThe A380 took another hit last week when the Australian airline Qantas canceled its long outstanding order, placed in 2006, for eight of the planes.The decision to cease production of the A380 will prompt job cuts at Airbus, potentially affecting as many as 3,500 of its 134,000 employees over the next three years. The move also overshadowed positive news in Airbus\u2019s full-year earnings report.Net income rose 29 percent in 2018 to 3.1 billion euros, or about $3.5 billion. Airbus said the decision to wind down production of the A380 was reflected in the 2018 financial figures, with the company taking a \u20ac463 million hit because of the decision by Emirates to scale back its order.Airbus did not give up easily on the A380, said Mr. Enders, the chief executive. But the demand wasn\u2019t there. \u201cIf you have a product that nobody wants any more or you can only sell below production costs, you have to stop it, as painful as it is,\u201d he said.Mr. Enders emphasized that the airplane would not disappear any time soon, noting that it was likely to be a presence in the skies into the 2030s.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the end of a production,\u201d he said at a news conference after the company earnings. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about end of a program.\u201dTo aviation analysts, the story of the A380 is the stuff of business case studies, and not the flattering kind. The life and death of the jet will stand as an example of the high cost of poor forecasting.\u201cIt was supposed to be a game changer,\u201d Mr. Netscher of Scope Group said. \u201cBut, yeah, well, the game changed.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: JPMorgan Has Its Own Cryptocurrency", "category": "Business", "id": "eb227713-201b-425e-a3a2-4a84cd82341f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/business/dealbook/jpmorgan-cryptocurrency-chase.html", "publishdate": 20190214, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/15/business/15db-newsletter-dimon/merlin_146406681_5e671316-3780-4784-b567-f7868dbbfb9c-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Thursday.

CNBC reports that the new digital coin will enter testing \u201cin a few months.\u201d It will facilitate a \u201ctiny fraction\u201d of its wholesale payments business.What\u2019s the point? \u201cMoney sloshes back and forth all over the world in a large enterprise,\u201d Umar Farooq, the head of JPMorgan\u2019s blockchain projects, told CNBC. \u201cIs there a way to ensure that a subsidiary can represent cash on the balance sheet without having to actually wire it to the unit? That way, they can consolidate their money and probably get better rates for it.\u201dIt also gives JPMorgan first-mover advantage. This will be one of the world\u2019s first real-world crypto applications for banking, and the biggest move into the sector yet by an American lender. It also sets the bank up for a future in which crypto could be an integral part of the financial sector.The bank has come a long way on crypto. Its C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, famously declared Bitcoin a \u201cfraud\u201d in 2017 and said he would fire any employee caught trading it. (He later regretted his comments and added that he believed in the value of blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies.)The threat of a government shutdown fadesCongress is expected to vote on a bipartisan border deal this evening that would ward off another government shutdown.President Trump may be resigned to signing it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see a shutdown,\u201d he told reporters yesterday. \u201cA shutdown would be a terrible thing.\u201dA lot of people need to be persuaded. Congressional leaders acknowledged that the bill doesn\u2019t allow for the wall that Mr. Trump and his allies want. (White House aides spent yesterday pitching the legislation to the likes of Lou Dobbs and Sean Hannity.) But it assigns more money to border fencing and immigration detention than left-wing Democrats would like.Still, no one sees a better option. \u201cAs with all compromises, I say to people, \u2018Support the bill for what is in it,\u2019 \u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters yesterday. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, warned his colleagues against letting \u201cunrelated cynical partisan plays get in the way of finishing this important process.\u201dIt\u2019s not done until Mr. Trump puts pen to paper. CNN reminds us that he backed out of a previous compromise at the last minute, triggering the longest-ever government shutdown. This time, he could try to find further border funding from elsewhere in the government to claim some sort of victory.The U.S.-China trade talks get seriousAfter three days of what Reuters calls \u201cdeputy-level meetings\u201d in China, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, will embark on high-level trade negotiations in Beijing today.China is stepping up. The U.S. officials will meet today with Vice Premier Liu He, President Xi Jinping\u2019s top economic adviser. According to the South China Morning Post, Mr. Xi himself may attend tomorrow.So far, it\u2019s unclear what progress is being made. President Trump has said only that discussions are \u201cgoing well,\u201d adding that Chinese negotiators were \u201cshowing us tremendous respect.\u201d Beijing has offered few details.But a deadline extension could help. America is scheduled to increase tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent if a deal isn\u2019t reached by March 1. Mr. Trump has said he might let that slide; Bloomberg puts the possible deadline extension at 60 days.Europe fights the U.S. over \u2018dirty money\u2019Relations between Washington and Brussels soured yesterday after the E.U. added four American territories to a blacklist of money-laundering regions, Jack Ewing and Alan Rappeport of the NYT write.On the list: Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands joined an ignominious group that includes North Korea, Libya, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. European banks must apply greater scrutiny to any transactions in those areas.The E.U.\u2019s rationale: \u201cDirty money is the lifeblood of organized crime and terrorism,\u201d Vera Jourova, the European commissioner for justice, said yesterday. \u201cIt was high time for Europe to act.\u201dThe Trump administration\u2019s response: The Treasury Department condemned the list as flawed and unnecessary, and complained that it \u201cwas not provided any meaningful opportunity to discuss with the European Commission its basis for including the listed U.S. territories.\u201dWhere things get tricky: \u201cThe deteriorating relationship between the longtime allies will complicate a resolution on trade,\u201d the NYT notes. \u201cTalks between the European Commission and the White House are on the back burner while the Trump administration focuses on resolving its trade war with China.

Such mergers would probably be completed more quickly than in the past, thanks to recent changes at the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, Lalita Clozel of the WSJ writes.How much faster? \u201cThe median time the Fed takes to approve or reject a bank merger receiving opposition from community groups \u2014 common in large deals \u2014 dropped to 3.8 months in the first half of 2018, from 5.6 months in the first half of 2017 and 7.0 months for all of 2015, according to a Fed report,\u201d Ms. Clozel writes \u201cAt the O.C.C., the average time for handling all mergers dropped to 1.9 months in 2018, from 2.6 months in 2016, the agency said.\u201dWhat changed? The Fed and the O.C.C. now review deals differently. One example: The O.C.C. says previous enforcement actions aren\u2019t necessarily red flags that could kill a transaction.Banking deal makers are happy. \u201cWe were very pleased with the efficiency of the regulatory approval process,\u201d said Kessel Stelling, the C.E.O. of Synovus, whose deal to buy FCB Financial Holdings won Fed approval in just four months.Others are not. Community groups, who usually press merging banks to increase lending in underserved areas, think they\u2019re being sidelined.

As wealthy collectors pull back on extravagances, investors could get stuck holding an asset they might have to unload at a loss.In 2012, when the market was roaring for passion assets \u2014 those in which you put money where your heart is \u2014 I wrote a series of columns on why people invested in things like vineyards, racehorses and sports teams.This time, I will look at five nontraditional asset classes that are popular with wealthy investors and with an eye on what to expect in a market downturn. Art is the first of five valuable but illiquid assets I plan to examine in the coming weeks. The others are cars, collectibles like wine and jewelry, private equity and real estate.Collecting fine art is as much about beauty and desirability as it about the investment value. Given how strong the art market has been over the past few years, many collectors may not be prepared if the economy slows and the appetite for art cools.Roy Sebag, a hedge fund analyst turned entrepreneur, has a collection that includes a drawing by Pablo Picasso and works by 17th-century Dutch masters. He said he took an objective view of his collection\u2019s value: looking at both the art\u2019s intrinsic value \u2014 how an artist\u2019s work has appreciated \u2014 and its social currency.\u201cIt\u2019s subjective,\u201d but it still allows for analysis on historical pricing, said Mr. Sebag, founder of Goldmoney, a site for buying and selling precious metals, and co-founder of Men\u00e9, a jewelry line. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a coincidence that Picasso is viewed by every high-net-worth individual as an asset they want to own.\u201d There are supposedly 5,000 works by Picasso, he said, a stock large enough to build a network of interested parties.By his analysis, avoiding emerging artists and buying works of a well-known artist like Picasso, despite having to pay millions of dollars to do so, is like buying a hedge against recession. \u201cWe know trends change quickly,\u201d he said.ImageRoy Sebag said buying the work of established artists over emerging ones was like buying a hedge against recession.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesSuch beliefs could be tested in the next few years.In 2018, works by the 100 top-selling artists, as measured by the market research firm Artprice, rose 4.3 percent in value, but the art market as a whole lost 1.9 percent. The company explained that buyers were becoming more demanding.\u201cWhile happy to pay big money for rare and high-quality works with irreproachable provenance, they often \u2018pass\u2019 on other works,\u201d its report said.In 2008, the art market was not immune to huge swings in value. Sales of postwar and contemporary art fell by more than two-thirds from 2008 to 2009, according to data collected by Athena Art Finance, which lends against art portfolios. It took until 2012 for sales to surpass pre-recession levels.To guard against seeing the value of an art collection plummet, dealers advise prudence and, not surprisingly, connoisseurship.If there is a lesson to be drawn from the recession, it is that buyers become more discerning in both the artists they favor and the price they will pay, said B. J. Topol, co-president of Topol Childs Art Advisory, which works on behalf of wealthy clients.\u201cThere\u2019s a reshuffling in a recession,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trendy artist of the time, people aren\u2019t looking at him. People want to make sure they\u2019re buying a known commodity and not taking risk.\u201dMs. Topol said she saw signs of a slowdown in the art market at the Art Basel international art fair in Miami Beach in December. Art wasn\u2019t being snapped up in the first few minutes. Instead, buyers had a chance to digest what they were seeing and negotiate on price.Regardless of the climate, she advises not to buy on trends, yet she stops short of the adage to buy what you love. That could be financially disastrous.Image\u201cI\u2019ve never collected thinking what I collect would be a good investment,\u201d said Jean Pigozzi, the venture capitalist. He has amassed a notable collection of contemporary African art.CreditEarl Gibson III/Getty Images\u201cIf you combine your passion with an informed decision,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019ll have something you love every day and maybe it goes up one day.\u201dOther collectors amass idiosyncratic collections whose value is greater together than apart. Peeling off several pieces in a downturn could depress the value of the collection as a whole, said Jean Pigozzi, a venture capitalist and art collector.\u201cI\u2019m not at all like all the other hedge fund collectors,\u201d said Mr. Pigozzi, who has amassed a significant collection of contemporary African art. \u201cI\u2019ve never collected thinking what I collect would be a good investment.\u201dHe said most of his pieces were not worth more than $100,000. Compare that with a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat, among the best-selling contemporary artists today. Mr. Pigozzi paid $1,000 for an artwork by Basquiat in 1982 and sold it last year for $3.2 million.What he has is a unique collection that is often included in museum shows and sought after by auction houses. In its totality, it offers a window into sub-Saharan art of the past 30 years.But Mr. Pigozzi knows selling it would be difficult without breaking it apart. Instead, he hopes to create a museum for it.Approaching art as a pure investment can be difficult, because values of an artist\u2019s work can change substantially in ways not associated with typical capital markets investing.The value of works by Wifredo Lam, for instance, has doubled or even tripled in the last decade because of a reappraisal of his place in art history, said Isabelle Bscher, the third-generation owner of Galerie Gmurzynska, which has represented artists including Yves Klein, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Picasso.ImageThe German artist Carsten H\u00f6ller directed the installation of works in Mr. Pigozzi\u2019s collection in Grenoble, France, in 2011. Mr. Pigozzi said he hoped to create a museum to house his collection.CreditPhilippe Desmazes/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesLam, who died in 1982, was Cuban by birth and grouped with other Latin American artists at auctions, which drew a specific collector. But he was later seen as a modern artist, because he was a friend of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning and other midcentury artists. As his artworks moved to more popular auctions, their value has doubled or tripled in a decade, Ms. Bscher said.A similar shift happened with Picasso about 15 years ago, she said. Collectors did not want to buy his work created after 1965, when the artist was in his 80s and seen as past his prime. At the time, the artworks were inexpensive, but they have since risen in value.Her advice: \u201cIf you buy the period of an artist that is not in fashion, you can make a great investment.\u201dThere are of course plenty of collectors with enough wealth to not really care about the short-term hit in value that the work on their walls may take. Hilary Geary Ross, an art collector and the wife of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, said she had always loved the work of Ren\u00e9 Magritte, the Belgian surrealist, and began buying his work when she and Mr. Ross married in 2004.She has 36 pieces by Magritte, worth in excess of $100 million. They include famous works like \u201cLa Clairvoyance.\u201d The billionaire couple have rarely sold any of their works, but Mrs. Ross said they did take advantage of the 2008 downturn to buy paintings.\u201cPeople come to us with them, because they know we like them,\u201d she said.In distressed markets, social concerns may keep some people from working with auction houses. They can try private sales \u2014 as happened with the Ross\u2019s acquisitions in 2008 \u2014 to sell something quietly.But Ms. Topol said that even then, discerning collectors were going to drive a hard bargain. If that happens, she said, dealers and auction houses can step in to help. But her advice echoes that of others: Don\u2019t sell art in a downturn unless other sources of liquidity have dried up.Mr. Sebag said that the art he owned had increased in value far more than other investments he had made, but that he would sell it only if he ceased to enjoy it.\u201cI think art is something you purchase without an exit strategy,\u201d Mr. Sebag said. \u201cMy idea of liquidity is in other investments.\u201dHaving those other buckets to draw from is important \u2014 otherwise, you could be forced to sell a prized work for less than you would want to when the economy sours."}, {"title": "Amazon and New York Unions Had \u2018Productive Meeting,\u2019 Then Came a Shock", "category": "Business", "id": "c9fe133e-045b-4865-b5a0-9053c87ae3f9", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/business/economy/amazon-union-cuomo.html", "publishdate": 20190215, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/15/business/15AMAZONUNION/merlin_150526893_54f24b69-a111-4183-bca0-dd8a6ae44adc-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "When Amazon announced Thursday that it was abandoning plans for an additional corporate headquarters in New York, no one was more surprised than the union leaders who were in talks with the company the day before.On Wednesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo brokered a meeting between labor leaders and Amazon executives that resulted in a tentative agreement to hash out ground rules for how the company would respond to efforts by workers to unionize, according to the head of the retail workers\u2019 union and another person who was present.Labor groups had resisted Amazon\u2019s plans for a vast Queens office complex partly because of what they saw as the company\u2019s hostile relationship to unions. One of the main sticking points was a newly opened $100 million Amazon warehouse on Staten Island\u2019s west shore, where the retail union is trying to organize the 2,500 workers.Workers went public with a campaign to unionize the warehouse in December, shortly after Amazon named Queens as one of the sites of its headquarters expansion. Labor leaders wanted the company to refrain from aggressively discouraging employees from joining a union. Amazon had been resistant. It has no unions across its huge nationwide network of warehouses or elsewhere among its work force.Amazon has other distribution centers in the region, but the Staten Island operation was its first foothold in New York City, where union opposition long kept Walmart, another nonunion retailer, from locating.[Read more on Amazon\u2019s decision to pull its planned New York headquarters.At a recent hearing, the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, asked Amazon executives whether they would remain neutral in the face of a unionization push. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d replied Brian Huseman, a vice president at the company. Reiterating a longstanding Amazon position, he said the company felt it could best address employees\u2019 concerns by maintaining a direct connection with them.Then, on Wednesday at 11 a.m., Stuart Appelbaum, the head of the retail union, decamped to Governor Cuomo\u2019s Manhattan office. In an interview, Mr. Appelbaum said he was joined at the meeting by officials from the Teamsters and the A.F.L.-C.I.O., while Amazon was represented by several executives. The governor presided over the exchange, which lasted more than an hour, according to Mr. Appelbaum and one other person present.\u201cIt was a very productive meeting, and we were ready to move forward,\u201d Mr. Appelbaum said in an interview. \u201cWe left there thinking we were on the road to dealing with our concerns.\u201d Amazon and Governor Cuomo\u2019s office would not comment on the meeting.There is no evidence that the union issue was the primary factor in Amazon\u2019s decision. But the 11th-hour meeting suggested that there remained an opening until just before the announcement came.By the meeting\u2019s close, Mr. Appelbaum said, Mr. Cuomo had outlined a plan that the unions believed would eventually result in an agreement. The governor wanted the labor groups to get their lawyers to draft language about how it would like the company to handle four aspects of its relationship with workers at the Staten Island warehouse, said Mr. Appelbaum and the other person.Under the terms discussed, they said, there would be no \u201chostility\u201d between Amazon and the union; the company would not retaliate against workers who sought to organize; there would be a fair union election process; and there would be some agreement about the union\u2019s access to workers and communications with them.The labor groups did not insist that Amazon refrain from making its anti-union case to workers, Mr. Appelbaum said. \u201cWe believe there should be neutrality\u201d by the company toward unionization, he added, \u201cbut the governor said in order to make the deal happen that wouldn\u2019t be part of it.\u201dOn Wednesday night, he said, his union\u2019s lawyers began writing guidelines based on the points raised at the meeting. He said he expected to keep talking with Amazon on how the two sides would deal with those issues.\u201cIt was a very cordial meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe addressed concerns. We listened to each other. We talked about next steps. Everyone agreed on a continued conversation.\u201d The meeting ended with handshakes, he said.But a day later, he learned from a news alert that Amazon was backing out."}, {"title": "Facebook Fine Could Total Billions if F.T.C.

The commissioners met in mid-December and were updated by staff members that they had at that point found considerable evidence of violations of the 2011 consent decree.The F.T.C. began its investigation into Facebook\u2019s mishandling of data after The New York Times reported in March 2018 that the information of 87 million users had been harvested by a British political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, without their permission.Facebook confirmed the negotiations with the F.T.C., which could still break down and lead to litigation. The discussions were first reported by The Washington Post.Facebook\u2019s 2011 consent decree requires the company to seek permission from users for plans to share their data with third parties. The trade commission also requires Facebook to notify it when third parties misuse this data.Some F.T.C. officials have pressed for maximum penalties because of several new reports of potential privacy breaches since the start of the investigation. The agency can seek up to $41,000 for each violation found by the agency. In the case of Cambridge Analytica, 87 million people were affected.The highest financial penalty imposed by the F.T.C. so far was a $22.5 million fine on Google for violating an agreement to protect consumer data.Continued news reports of data violations, including a Times report about data sharing between Facebook and partner tech companies in December, have raised concerns among F.T.C. officials of setting the fine too low, according to a person familiar with the discussions.The agency is under pressure to show teeth in its Facebook investigation, and the company\u2019s missteps over the past two years have made it a target for lawmakers. Members of Congress have complained that the F.T.C. is lagging behind European regulators that have taken a tougher stand with internet companies."}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: The Bigger Picture Behind Amazon Ditching N.Y.", "category": "Business", "id": "ab341c1c-08c1-43a1-b40d-70104a312ec2", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/business/dealbook/amazon-new-york.html", "publishdate": 20190215, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/16/business/16db-newsletter-amazonnyc/merlin_150700647_3107cdea-d680-4729-accc-09a9091c75da-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Friday.

The tech giant ultimately decided to open two new sites \u2014 in Queens and in Virginia. Each would have gained an estimated 25,000 jobs.\u2022 But Amazon faced a backlash in New York from lawmakers, activists and union leaders who said it didn\u2019t deserve nearly $3 billion in government incentives.\u2022 \u201cThe company made its decision late Wednesday, after growing increasingly concerned that the backlash in New York showed no sign of abating and was tarnishing its image beyond the city,\u201d J. David Goodman of the NYT writes.\u2022 \u201cLooking at the opposition and the timeline we decided we don\u2019t want to work in this environment in the long term,\u201d Jodi Seth, the head of policy communications for Amazon, told NBC News.This could be a turning point for corporate-civic relations. It will surely change how companies think about doing business in certain states and cities. It\u2019s also likely to make political leaders \u2014 especially in Democratic regions \u2014 reconsider offering tax incentives to lure business. (One big question here: Should states and cities be allowed to offer subsidies to business in the first place?)It\u2019s also a clear sign that leftist views are gaining traction. The news is a short-term win for progressive politicians like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are championing what they say are socialist messages. (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez appeared to revel in the decision on Twitter, saying that \u201canything is possible.\u201d) But in the longer term, those lawmakers may face a backlash if the loss of those 25,000 jobs in Long Island City hurts the local economy.And it raises questions about the wider understanding of finance. \u201cN.Y.C. wasn\u2019t handing cash to Amazon. It was an incentive program based on job creation, producing tax revenue,\u201d Andrew tweeted. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a $3 billion pile of money that can now be spent on subways or education.\u201dMore: The news came as a shock even to some of the labor groups that opposed the plans. Here\u2019s what people are saying about the decision in New York City. Real-estate brokers are in despair. And tech could keep gaining ground in the city regardless.The government will stay open. But the border fight isn\u2019t over.President Trump looks set to sign a bipartisan deal as soon as today to provide funding for border security and the federal government. But he\u2019s also expected to declare a national emergency to get more money to build his long-promised border wall.Everything nearly fell apart yesterday. \u201cThe president was frustrated after a briefing by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and others on details of the final deal to avoid a shutdown,\u201d the WaPo reports, citing unnamed officials involved in the discussions. But assertions by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, that the president had actually beaten Democrats helped sway Mr. Trump.By declaring a national emergency, Mr. Trump is hoping to gain access to billions more in federal funds. Combined with the spending bill and other ways of diverting money, he expects to get about $8 billion. (He originally asked for $5.7 billion from Congress.)There are huge concerns about the declaration. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s willingness to invoke emergency powers to circumvent Congress is likely to go down as an extraordinary violation of constitutional norms \u2014 setting a precedent that future presidents of both parties may emulate to unilaterally achieve their own policy goals,\u201d Charlie Savage of the NYT writes.What next? House Democrats will probably try to terminate any declaration and the Senate may follow suit, Nicholas Fandos of the NYT writes. But Mr. Trump would veto that legislation, and it\u2019s unlikely that Congress could override him. The White House could face legal battles over the declaration for years.ImageCreditJosh Edelson/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesFacebook faces a huge fine from the F.T.C.The social network is in talks with the Federal Trade Commission to settle allegations of privacy violations.

That leaves the state of the negotiations uncertain ahead of a deadline in two weeks.\u2022 \u201cThe two sides have been struggling with more than 100 issues raised by the United States in a lengthy statement given to Chinese officials in May.\u201d\u2022 Expectations for the talks were low, though some progress was made in the prelude to this week\u2019s discussions. For example, China agreed to disclose more of its government subsidies to the World Trade Organization.\u2022 But big hurdles remained, Mr. Bradsher writes, including \u201cthe Trump administration\u2019s desire to put meaningful restrictions on China\u2019s ability to keep investing enormous sums of money from the government, and from government-affiliated financial institutions, in a wide range of advanced manufacturing sectors that compete with American industries.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe United States had given China a March 2 deadline toward reaching a deal and threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent.

Given the lack of progress to date, that looks like a tall order.More Brexit news: Brussels rejected calls for dual-listed shares in London and the E.U. in the event of no deal. Why the Big Board is suing the S.E.C. over price controlsThe New York Stock Exchange took the S.E.C. to court yesterday over a so-called Transaction Fee Pilot program that sorts listed stocks into categories with varying price controls. In a WSJ op-ed, Stacey Cunningham, the exchange\u2019s president, explains why:\u2022 \u201cThe new rule amounts to an unnecessary exercise in government price-setting that will add a new layer of complexity to equity markets.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe Transaction Fee Pilot imposes government control on the incentives that public markets can offer. Market-maker benefits will be sharply reduced for some securities and fully eliminated for others.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe N.Y.S.E. voiced its concerns to the S.E.C. during its public-comment period. We argued that the pilot will undermine the ability of market forces to drive capital formation and will fail at its goal of measuring broker conflicts.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe S.E.C. freely admits it has no idea whether its pilot program will help or harm investors.

For three hours he speaks. He\u2019s got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. I mean, this guy is unbelievable.\u201dThe president added that none of the favorites he mentioned, most of whom work for Fox News, drove his decisions: \u201cThey don\u2019t decide policy,\u201d he said.The question that got Mr. Trump to discuss his cable and radio cheering squad came from the NBC News reporter Kelly O\u2019Donnell. It seemed apt after what had occurred in December, when the presidency seemed perhaps more entwined than usual with prominent figures in conservative media.At the time, Mr. Trump appeared willing to sign a continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown, even without money for the wall. Then a few of his most influential supporters, including Mr. Hannity and Mr. Limbaugh, lasered in on the lack of wall funding and pleaded with Mr. Trump to refuse to sign the bill. He did exactly that, leading to a 35-day shutdown, the longest in the government\u2019s history.This week, as the deadline on the temporary spending measure that ended the shutdown loomed, the president was willing to go ahead with a newly proposed budget, even though it had less money for a border wall than was on the table at one point last year.In contrast to December, Mr. Trump reached out to a synod of conservative commentators in an effort to assuage their concerns.His administration talked with Mr. Hannity and Lou Dobbs, the Fox Business Network host. The purpose was to politick the right-wing media with the message that Mr. Trump deserved support for the new bill because he had forced concessions.Trump\u2019s Emergency Declaration Is the First Since 9/11 to Authorize Military ActionHere\u2019s how President Trump\u2019s border wall fits on the list of emergency declarations.He also would declare a national emergency as a way to get around Congress and provide dollars for the wall, a move conservatives championed.\u201cWe\u2019re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we\u2019re going to do it one way or the other,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the Rose Garden. \u201cIt\u2019s an invasion. We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.\u201dBut not everyone in the right-wing punditocracy endorsed Mr. Trump. Ann Coulter, who was an early supporter of the president, has now become a thorn in his side.In December, she published a blistering column on her website calling Mr. Trump a \u201cgigantic douchebag\u201d for not having made headway on a border wall. This week, as many anticipated Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to approve the spending bill, she didn\u2019t let up, saying on Twitter that the goal of the national emergency \u201cis for Trump to scam the stupidest people in his base for 2 more years.\u201dThe president spoke of Ms. Coulter on Friday, but not in the most glowing terms.\u201cI don\u2019t know her,\u201d the president said Friday. \"I haven\u2019t spoken to her in way over a year. But the press loves saying \u2018Ann Coulter.\u2019\u201dHe continued: \u201cI have nothing against her. In fact, I like her for one reason. When they asked her, right at the beginning, who is going to win the election? She said, \u2018Donald Trump.\u2019 And the two people that asked her that question smiled. They said, \u2018You\u2019re kidding, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Nope, Donald Trump.\u2019 So I like her.\u201dA few seconds later, he added, \u201cBut she\u2019s off the reservation, but anybody who knows her understands that.\u201dAfter the news conference, Ms. Coulter tweeted: \u201cHe seems to think \u2018the reservation\u2019 is HIM, not his campaign promises.\u201dThree minutes later, she posted another, this time about the constitutional provision allowing for the removal of a president from office: \u201cNo. 1 trending topic on Twitter: 25th Amendment.\u201dMr. Trump also cued up one of his old anti-press hits during the news conference. When Jim Acosta, the CNN reporter whose White House credentials he suspended late last year, asked about \u201ccritics who say you\u2019re creating a national emergency in order to get your wall,\u201d the president was ready.\u201cYour question is a very political question, because you have an agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re CNN. You\u2019re fake news.\u201d"}, {"title": "The Week in Tech: A Break From Consumer Tech", "category": "Business", "id": "a983a498-0907-4f17-b785-01acab36cf13", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/technology/the-week-in-tech-a-break-from-consumer-tech.html", "publishdate": 20190215, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/16/business/16technewsletter1/merlin_140515467_c99eb635-980c-423a-bf4c-c91a5722555d-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Hi. I\u2019m Steve Lohr. I write about the technology industry, from the old titans like IBM to start-ups working on the future of artificial intelligence.In this week\u2019s newsletter, we\u2019re largely taking a break from the consumer internet giants, and the various controversies swirling around them. (Exception: Amazon\u2019s surprise announcement on Thursday to abandon its plans to build a headquarters in New York. See below.)Instead, we\u2019re going to look at recent research and reports that track how digital technology is moving into mainstream industries, and the implications.Let\u2019s start with a smart piece this week by my colleague Erin Griffith, \u201cThe Next Wave of \u2018Unicorn\u2019 Start-Ups.\u201d Erin asked CB Insights, a research firm that studies start-ups and venture capital, to create a list of the next wave of young companies likely to reach valuations of $1 billion or more. She then reported on some of the 50 companies.The first round of well-known unicorns, led by Uber and Airbnb, she writes, exploited smartphones and cloud computing to upend old-line businesses. The next companies poised to become unicorns are going narrower, deeper and into more fields.\u201cThey largely focus on software,\u201d she writes, \u201cfor specific industries like farms, banks and life sciences companies.\u201dThat kind of broad-based adoption across the nation\u2019s $20 trillion economy is what will deliver growth and higher living standards for many. Yet the advance of data-driven artificial intelligence will also provide real-world evidence of how much and how quickly this technology may widen income disparities and kill jobs.The short answer, it seems, is not as fast as techno-pessimists fear. A.I.\u2019s progress is impressive, but limited. An article this week by Cade Metz, \u201cA.I. Shows Promise Assisting Physicians,\u201d  underlines that point.The piece describes an A.I. research program whose accuracy matched or slightly surpassed human physicians in diagnosing common childhood diseases like influenza. The software was trained on the medical histories, lab tests and other clinical data in more than 600,000 electronic health records of children in southern China.It was an encouraging demonstration. But the experimental system relied on the easy access to personal data in China, where privacy regulations are less restrictive, and was confined to diagnosing common ailments.That step-by-step approach is the counsel for business in a new book by Thomas Davenport, \u201cThe AI Advantage: How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to Work\u201d (MIT Press). Mr. Davenport, a professor of information technology and management at Babson College, is a seasoned expert in using digital data to streamline operations and spot opportunities. And he\u2019s been at it since well before the current A.I. wave, which is both a technological evolution and a branding craze.His advice to mainstream companies is that the best course is often to use basic A.I. tools to automate mundane office tasks in operations like accounting, billing, payments and customer service \u2014 and to avoid \u201cmoon shots.\u201dOne of Mr. Davenport\u2019s prime examples of a misguided moon shot was IBM\u2019s initial efforts to apply its Watson technology to diagnosing cancer. That was a high-profile science project that proved more difficult, time-consuming and costly than anticipated, though IBM continues that work with several leading cancer centers.Speaking of IBM, the company was out in San Francisco this week for its annual Think conference, which attracted more than 25,000 attendees. Its executives presented its Watson and cloud technology as the trusted path for companies across the industrial spectrum that want to embrace A.I.IBM cannot compete head-on with Amazon, Microsoft and Google in the big-spending game of building out massive data centers to provide the infrastructure layer of cloud computing to one and all. So it is seeking to shift the competition.IBM talks about \u201cchapter two\u201d in the cloud market. Increasingly, it says, companies will run not only new applications but also their legacy software on the cloud, either private clouds in their own data centers or on IBM\u2019s cloud. The next stage of cloud computing, Virginia Rometty, IBM\u2019s chief executive, told Jon Fortt of CNBC, \u201cis going to be driven by the modernization of mission-critical apps. That\u2019s our sweet spot.\u201dAnd in a nod to reality, IBM announced a Watson Anywhere initiative: Its A.I. technology will run on the popular clouds of Amazon, Microsoft or Google as well as IBM\u2019s cloud.In other news:\u25a0 J. David Goodman, City Hall reporter for The Times, deftly explained the shifting politics before Amazon withdrew its plan in \u201cWhy Amazon Is Caught in an Unexpected Brawl in New York.\u201d But what happened in Queens is part of a broader resistance to the tech boom, and its consequences. After the protests surfaced last year, Fred Wilson, the dean of New York venture capitalists, told me that \u201cit\u2019s partly from a sense that Amazon coming in is not going to help them, and will only drive up their costs. To really be a success in New York, the benefits of the tech sector have to extend to every borough and every neighborhood.\u201dThat concern, across the country, as A.I. technology marches ahead, is the subject of  a lengthy analysis this week by Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\u25a0 For a rich, enlightening read, I recommend a piece in this week\u2019s New York Times Magazine, \u201cThe Secret History of Women in Coding.\u201d The \u201csecret\u201d is a headline writer\u2019s exaggeration. Anyone with an interest in computing history knows about Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper and the women who programmed the early Eniac computer. Those stories have been told repeatedly, including in books.But Clive Thompson, the author, elegantly weaves that history around the story of an early female programmer who is alive and recalls it all. His piece captures what it was like in the 1940s through early 1960s, when writing software was a wide-open field, before a male-dominated culture took root.As Lois Haibt \u2014 who in 1955, as a freshly minted Vassar College graduate, joined the IBM team that created Fortran, the first popular programming language \u2014 once told me: \u201cThey took anyone who seemed to have an aptitude for problem-solving skills \u2014 bridge players, chess players, even women.\u201d"}, {"title": "China and U.S. to Continue Trade Talks Next Week", "category": "Business", "id": "d81d2c5e-be48-42fe-b9c5-b52233dcaac9", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/business/trump-china-us-trade.html", "publishdate": 20190215, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/16/world/16chinatrade-1sub/merlin_150718812_2c97a921-b44d-4118-9293-db6da2c0fb4f-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "BEIJING \u2014 United States officials said on Friday that they had made \u201cprogress\u201d during a week of trade talks with their Chinese counterparts, but big sticking points remain and the two sides plan to continue negotiations next week in Washington to try to end the trade war.The United States and China are trying to reach an agreement ahead of a March 2 deadline, when President Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25 percent from 10 percent. On Friday, Mr. Trump suggested for the second time in a week that he would push the deadline back if the two sides were edging closer to a deal.\u201cThere is a possibility that I will extend the date,\u201d Mr. Trump said during remarks at the White House, noting the complexity of the negotiations. \u201cI will do that at the same tariffs we are at now; I would not increase the tariffs.\u201dMr. Trump said the discussions with Beijing were going \u201cextremely well\u201d but added that the only thing that mattered was whether the two sides could reach a deal that resolved his concerns about China\u2019s trade practices.\u201cWe\u2019re a lot closer than we ever were in this country to having a real trade deal,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that the agreement with China would cover \u201ctheft\u201d and \u201cunfairness.\u201dBut significant differences remain in the trade talks, and it is unclear whether they can be resolved, people briefed on the negotiations said.\u201cThese detailed and intensive discussions led to progress between the two parties,\u201d the White House press secretary said in a statement. \u201cMuch work remains, however.\u201dAmerican officials said the talks focused on so-called structural reforms that the United States wanted China to make, and on China\u2019s purchase of American goods and services. The White House said Friday that any agreement between the two countries would be included in \u201ca memoranda of understanding between the two countries.\u201dThe most difficult and intractable issue involves the Trump administration\u2019s desire to put meaningful restrictions on China\u2019s ability to keep investing enormous sums of money from the government, and from government-affiliated financial institutions, in a wide range of advanced manufacturing sectors that compete with American industries. These include areas like commercial aircraft manufacturing, semiconductors and artificial intelligence.Another challenge for negotiators is that both sides perceive national security as being at stake in some cases.China has been reluctant to unblock internet access to its market for some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest and most successful businesses, like Facebook and Google. It fears that without stringent censorship, everything from democratic ideas to pornography would be harder to fight.Mr. Trump said that American tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports were hurting China \u201cvery badly\u201d and that it would be \u201can honor\u201d to remove them if an agreement could be reached. He acknowledged that a deal of such magnitude could take more than just a few weeks.The president, speaking from the Rose Garden, added that he would most likely meet with President Xi Jinping of China \u201cat some point\u201d to work out any remaining differences between the two countries.The prospect of extending the March deadline has divided Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers, with hard-liners such as Robert Lighthizer, the administration\u2019s top trade negotiator, increasingly wary that China is trying to run out the clock or clinch an unenforceable deal that it will ultimately break. A delay in the deadline would be viewed internally as a win for Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, who has been pushing hard to put the trade war to rest and calm markets.Mr. Mnuchin said that he and Mr. Lighthizer had \u201cproductive meetings\u201d with Liu He, China\u2019s economic czar.Mr. Lighthizer and Mr. Mnuchin also met with Mr. Xi on Friday afternoon at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Stocks in the United States were up 1 percent on Friday as optimism about the state of the negotiations calmed jittery investors.The talks did allow both sides to at least begin hashing out their differences. Both the United States and China began somewhat mechanically combining their lists of offers into a memorandum of understanding that included areas of disagreement in bracketed text, with each side\u2019s separate views listed for each issue, people briefed on the talks said. Compiling the various offers could someday make it possible for the countries\u2019 leaders to go through the options more systematically.But the broad areas of disagreement still left in the bracketed text mean that an actual, comprehensive understanding between the two sides remains elusive.The negotiations did not include any big new concessions by China to limit its government-led push to build high-tech industries in competition with the West, said the people, who insisted on anonymity because of the diplomatic and financial sensitivity of the talks.China Central Television, a state-controlled broadcaster, said early Friday evening on its website that progress had been made. It said the talks would continue in Washington next week.\u201cNew progress has been made on important and difficult issues,\u201d CCTV said, without providing any details. \u201cAlthough there is still a lot of work to be done, we have hope.\u201dChina is in the middle of a sharp economic slowdown, triggered partly by Beijing\u2019s efforts to rein in debt but also by a sudden faltering in the willingness of consumers to spend and industries to invest. Many business leaders attribute the decline in consumer and investor confidence to the trade war.That economic backdrop has given Chinese leaders an incentive to emphasize progress in the talks. Mr. Mnuchin has also stressed progress, allaying worries among stock market investors. Mr. Lighthizer has said little in public while pressing for a comprehensive trade deal.The two sides have been struggling with more than 100 issues raised by the United States in a lengthy statement given to Chinese officials in May. In preparation for this week\u2019s talks, the two sides had been unable to even agree on a draft framework for the broad outlines of a possible deal, so expectations for any comprehensive settlement had been low from the start.Many of the issues, like how to handle the tech sector, have been festering between the United States and China for a long time. Many high-tech issues are also changing and evolving along with the sector, making it especially difficult to put in place a durable agreement.\u201cParticularly in the areas of technology regulation and standards, it will be a game of Whac-a-Mole at best,\u201d said James Green, who was the top trade official at the United States Embassy in Beijing until August and is now a senior nonresident fellow at Georgetown University.The negotiations this week have encompassed some issues on which incremental progress has been made in recent weeks, people briefed on the negotiations said. China has agreed to disclose more of its government subsidies to the World Trade Organization, these people said.Chinese officials have also expressed a willingness to let foreign companies participate in panels that set standards on important industrial issues, like fuel-economy averages for cars. But while that might give foreign companies a glimpse of upcoming rules, they would be in a minority and might not have much influence.The Trump administration also sees national security at issue in a long list of products that the United States either already imports from China or might be likely to import in the next few years. These include many products, from nuclear reactor components to aircraft engine parts, from among the $50 billion of annual imports on which the administration imposed 25 percent tariffs in the summer.China has tried repeatedly over the past year and a half to allay American concerns about its government-subsidized investments in high-tech industries by offering to guarantee very large purchases from the United States of everything from soybeans to helicopters.In some cases, the purchase offers are being poorly received in the United States because they could distort existing supply chains. This week, China offered to ramp up purchases of American semiconductors, to the industry\u2019s chagrin.\u201cThe reported offer by China to vastly increase its purchases of U.S. semiconductors may look good at first glance, but it\u2019s a mirage, aimed at shuffling U.S. supply chains and driving them deeper into China,\u201d said John Neuffer, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association. \u201cIt would also represent a significant departure from the market-driven economics that have long defined our sector and the U.S. economy.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe are confident U.S. government negotiators will see through this distraction.\u201dThe Trump administration and the American business community have mostly been leery about an agreement that centers on purchases of goods but does not address long-term issues involving China\u2019s government-backed drive for high-tech competitiveness. Some market-oriented economists in China have also advocated limits on the government\u2019s industrial policies, because they worry about the ever-rising debt associated with them.\u201cIf we don\u2019t address the deeper issues, neither side will be doing itself any favors,\u201d said Tim Stratford, who is the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China and the managing partner of the Beijing office of the Covington and Burling law firm.Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi agreed in Buenos Aires on Dec. 1 on a stopgap compromise that does not fully satisfy either side but might prove durable. Mr. Trump agreed not to raise tariffs further then but kept in place the tariffs he had already imposed, while China removed most of the retaliation that it had imposed.That deal has not satisfied trade hawks in the United States, who want broader changes in the bilateral relationship, or the more nationalistic wing of the Chinese Communist Party, which perceived the deal as representing, to some extent, a Chinese retreat."}, {"title": "Amazon Invests in Rivian, a Tesla Rival in Electric Vehicles", "category": "Business", "id": "7e1ec4c8-f141-4616-9528-e54ffbc362dd", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/business/rivian-amazon.html", "publishdate": 20190215, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/16/business/16RIVIAN/merlin_147402348_04100224-1260-4da6-95a7-34aa3a254d62-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "A potential rival to Tesla in electric cars just got a big boost from Amazon.The online retail giant is leading a $700 million investment in Rivian, a Michigan company that is developing a battery-powered pickup truck and an electric sport utility vehicle. The automaker announced the new round of investment on Friday, offering few details but saying it would remain independent.Founded in 2009 by an M.I.T.-trained engineer, R. J. Scaringe, Rivian first showed its truck and S.U.V. at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November. The key feature of each is a chassis that is shaped like a skateboard and includes all the components that propel the vehicles \u2014 a large battery pack, axles, suspension, cooling system and four electric motors. The company says its pickup will be able to go up to 400 miles on a full charge.The deal is the latest example of how the auto industry is being reshaped by new technologies and nimble companies that have raced ahead of many traditional carmakers. While General Motors, Ford Motor and others are scrambling to introduce new electric vehicles, Tesla has become by far the leading seller of electric cars in the United States. Waymo, a division of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is considered by some analysts to be the leading developer of autonomous vehicles.\u201cWe\u2019re inspired by Rivian\u2019s vision for the future of electric transportation,\u201d Jeff Wilke, Amazon\u2019s chief executive for worldwide consumer, said in a statement. \u201cR. J. has built an impressive organization, with a product portfolio and technology to match. We\u2019re thrilled to invest in such an innovative company.\u201dAn Amazon spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the thinking behind the Rivian investment.Since 2015, Amazon has been building out its own logistics network, one that is a \u201cglobal, end-to-end network covering all transportation modalities,\u201d Morgan Stanley said in a research note last month. It owns dozens of planes and has a transoceanic shipping operation, not to mention trucks, rail and other ways to deliver products and packages. The company spent more than $27 billion on worldwide shipping last year.Amazon relies on contract drivers in passenger cars and trucks to make many last-minute deliveries quicker than it can through delivery partners like the United States Postal Service. Last month, the company said it was testing a delivery device called Scout, which is the size of a large ice chest that can \u201croll along sidewalks at a walking pace.\u201d The company says it is using the devices to deliver packages to customers in a suburb near Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters.The company ordered 20,000 Mercedes-Benz vans last year for its delivery partners to shuttle Amazon products to consumers, but those vans run on diesel, a fossil fuel. The company has also been facing pressure from employees looking to reduce its environmental impact, particularly in its logistics operations.And last week, Amazon made a \u201csignificant\u201d investment in Aurora, a California start-up that is developing self-driving technology. Aurora is led by Chris Urmson, who previously headed Alphabet\u2019s autonomous car effort.\u201cFor Amazon, this small investment is a good way to enlarge their bet on the E.V. automotive market without having to tool up a plant to find out if it will fly,\u201d said Matt DeLorenzo, senior managing editor of Kelley Blue Book. \u201cOver time, the Rivian investment could give Amazon a starting point to own and operate an in-house package delivery business.\u201dRivian previously raised about $500 million from Sumitomo, a Japanese conglomerate known for its tire division, and Abdul Latif Jameel, a Saudi industrial group. Those earlier investors also took part in the new investment round, though the companies did not say how much money they put in.At the Los Angeles show, Mr. Scaringe described the company's pickup, the R1T, and its S.U.V., the R1S, as upscale vehicles that could be used for off-road adventures. They are intended to compete for motorists who buy pricey Land Rovers and Porsche S.U.V.s. Rivian\u2019s vehicles are expected to sell for $68,000 or more.\u201cThis is a vehicle you can use,\u201d Mr. Scaringe said. \u201cYou can get it dirty, but it\u2019s still a very thoughtful, intelligent design.\u201dBoth vehicles may end up competing directly with Tesla models. Tesla already offers an S.U.V., the Model X, and is working on a pickup truck and a smaller S.U.V. Rivian has said it aims to sell about 20,000 vehicles in 2021 and double that in 2022. Last year, Tesla sold about 245,000 cars.Analysts said Rivian\u2019s success was by no means assured.\u201cThey still face all the hurdles,\u201d said Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Cox Automotive. \u201cThey have to produce the vehicles. They have to deliver the vehicles. Tesla has been around longer, but it\u2019s still struggling to set up a dealer network and is struggling with high-volume production.\u201dRivian has kept a low profile, especially compared with Tesla and its flamboyant chief executive, Elon Musk. Until recently, to keep its operations secret, Rivian did not display its name on its buildings. While Mr. Scaringe has a Twitter account, he has posted only 87 tweets \u2014 a small fraction of Mr. Musk\u2019s nearly 7,000.And while Tesla and Mr. Musk regularly make headlines, relatively little is known about Mr. Scaringe, who is 36. He grew up near Melbourne, Fla.; studied at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; and earned a doctorate in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.He then created a company, Mainstream Motors, in Florida, intending to produce an affordable sports car that could go 60 miles on a gallon of gas. In 2011, the company was renamed Rivian, and its focus shifted to electric vehicles.Rivian employs 600 people, with its main office in Plymouth, Mich., about 30 miles west of Detroit. In 2016, it bought a mothballed auto plant in Normal, Ill., previously owned by Mitsubishi Motors.Chris Koos, the mayor of Normal, where Rivian plans to produce its vehicles, described Mr. Scaringe as a \u201cbroad thinker\u201d who seems immersed in operational details.\u201cWhen you ask him a technical question, you can expect about a 10-minute answer,\u201d Mr. Koos said."}, {"title": "Tempted by Holiday Car Sales?

It may be challenging to find an affordable one, given rising prices and higher financing costs.The long Presidents\u2019 Day weekend is traditionally a popular time to buy a car, as dealers advertise sales, including deals on last year\u2019s models still sitting on their lots.Yet people who haven\u2019t shopped for a car in several years may find that they will have to spend thousands more than they did the last time they bought a new vehicle, said Matt Jones, senior consumer advice editor with the auto website Edmunds.\u201cThe change could be dramatic,\u201d Mr. Jones said, suggesting that returning shoppers should be prepared for \u201csticker shock.\u201dThe average transaction price for a new car was expected to top $37,000 in January, Edmunds found. (Average sale prices are higher, in part, because of consumers\u2019 preference for more expensive sport utility vehicles and high-end pickup trucks, said Anil Goyal, executive vice president for operations at Black Book. He also cited the effect of more costly technology options offered in new cars, along with the impact of new tariffs on steel and aluminum.)Edmunds found that the average interest rate for new cars bought with financing reached 6.19 percent in January, the second-highest monthly reading in 10 years and up from 4.99 percent in January 2018 and 4.22 percent five years ago. Zero-percent-financing offers are less plentiful, reaching their lowest level since 2006, the site found.The upshot? The average new car payment is about $551 a month, Edmunds found. Ouch.One reason for the increase in the cost of cars is the \u201ctrickle-down\u201d of luxury features \u2014 heated steering wheels, for instance \u2014 to lower-end models, said Jeff Bartlett, deputy editor specializing in cars at Consumer Reports. Also, the advent of features like automatic emergency braking, blind-spot warning and forward-collision warning can make cars much safer, he said, but also add to the price.As cars become more expensive, consumers are financing them with longer-term loans to reduce monthly payments. A typical car loan used be three years, or four at the most. Now, five- and six-year terms are common.While longer loans make payments affordable, they can put borrowers at risk for being \u201cupside down\u201d on the loan, or owing more than the car is worth, said Laura Adams, education analyst at DriversEd.com. That can be a problem if the owner wants to trade in the car for a new model during the term of the loan, or hits a financial bump and needs to sell the car quickly.Even with longer loan terms, there are new signs that borrowers are having trouble keeping up with their payments. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported this past week that a record seven million Americans were three months or more behind on their car loans.While shoppers may find deals on Presidents\u2019 Day weekend, there may be better offers in the spring because of another factor. Early signs are that income tax refunds are smaller than expected because of changes resulting from the 2017 tax law.Because consumers often put their refunds toward the purchase of a car, that could result in \u201cslightly lower demand for car shopping this spring,\u201d according to Black Book, which provides car pricing guides for dealers and lenders.That, in turn, could translate into more dealer incentives this spring to move cars off sales lots, Mr. Bartlett said.Or, Mr. Goyal of Black Book said, it could just mean that shoppers will adjust their sights, and choose lower-cost new cars, or perhaps used autos, instead.Here are some questions and answers about car shopping on the long weekend:How can I get the best price on a new car?Don\u2019t be pressured into buying something just because it\u2019s the holiday weekend and dealers are promoting sales, Mr. Bartlett said. \u201cBuy when it\u2019s the right time for you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll always be another car buying opportunity. There\u2019s no shortage of cars.\u201dIf you\u2019re ready to shop, do some homework online about models and prices before you visit a dealership to strengthen your negotiating position and reduce stress.\u201cDo your research in advance, have a short list and test-drive all of them,\u201d he said. Tell the dealer that you\u2019re not buying yet, to help reduce pressure.For a three-day weekend, Mr. Jones suggested narrowing your list to two or three models by Saturday. Test-drive the cars on Sunday, then buy \u2014 if you\u2019re ready \u2014 on Monday.Also, be flexible. Overall car quality has improved immensely, Mr. Jones said, so you may be able to find an affordable option by looking beyond your first choice. \u201cTake off your blinders, if you\u2019re loyal to one brand,\u201d he said.Do I have to use the dealer\u2019s financing offer?No. Consider getting preapproved for a loan at your own bank or credit union before visiting a dealership, Ms. Adams said. That way, you\u2019ll know how much money you qualify for and you\u2019ll have a base rate to compare with the dealership\u2019s offer.While buying is generally less expensive than leasing over all, shoppers may want to consider leasing in certain situations \u2014 if, say, a teenager is going to be driving the car. Leasing may make a car with the latest safety features more affordable, which is an acceptable trade-off if an inexperienced driver is behind the wheel, Mr. Bartlett said.How can I judge if a car is affordable for me?A good rule of thumb is \u201c20-4-10\u201d: Put at least 20 percent down in cash, stick to a four-year loan, and aim for a monthly payment that is no more than 10 percent of your gross income.Mr. Bartlett\u2019s general advice is to pay cash for a car, if you can. If financing is a must, a loan term of 48 months at the most, at a rate as near zero as possible, is the next best option. \u201cGoing beyond that is a bad investment on a depreciating asset,\u201d he said.Many shoppers, unfortunately, are dazzled by cars that cost more than they can afford, he said. So it\u2019s a good idea to keep long-term financial goals in mind.\u201cBuying a more humble vehicle or buying used can save money today, help achieve the long-term goals and will still get you from point A to point B,\u201d he said.Used cars \u2014 particularly a reliable model that\u2019s just a few years old \u2014 are often a smart compromise, Ms. Adams said. You\u2019ll still get recent safety features but at a more affordable price. The average monthly payment on a used car, Edmunds found, is $407 a month."}, {"title": "For Some 2020 Democrats, Rejection of Amazon Aligns With Liberal Policy Views", "category": "Politics", "id": "4d3fff33-328c-4854-89bd-0895c2d206d6", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/us/politics/amazon-democrats-2020.html", "publishdate": 20190216, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/16/us/politics/16amazonDems/16amazonDems-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The decision by Amazon this week to abandon its planned headquarters in New York City tapped into one of the major themes of left-wing Democrats: that giant corporations \u2014 and in some cases the billionaires who run them \u2014 must be held to account for wage inequality, corporate greed and middle-class stagnation.And some contenders and would-be contenders for the party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination were quick to take a victory lap over the retailer\u2019s sudden reversal.The economic incentives offered the company amounted to no more than \u201ctaxpayer bribes,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who accused Amazon of holding American democracy \u201chostage.\u201d.@Amazon \u2013 one of the wealthiest companies on the planet \u2013 just walked away from billions in taxpayer bribes, all because some elected officials in New York aren't sucking up to them enough. How long will we allow giant corporations to hold our democracy hostage? https://t.co/O9pz7en43B\u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) February 14, 2019\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has introduced the \u201cStop BEZOS Act\u201d to tax companies that he says underpay employees, congratulated New Yorkers \u201cfor standing up to the power of Amazon.\u201dTheir blunt condemnation of Amazon underscores the extent to which this has become an animating issue for the far left. And their reaction is one act in a broader set of 2020 issues for progressive Democrats that includes the Green New Deal, which proposes far-reaching federal intervention in the economy to tackle climate change, and the determination to rein in leviathan tech companies, whose founders have lost their luster as heroes of a new economy.Candidates and potential candidates perceived as more centrist did not immediately weigh in, reflecting one of the fault lines in a Democratic Party wrestling over who is the best standard-bearer to suit up for a coming titanic struggle with President Trump. Some candidates, like Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, have deeper connections to tech companies.The views of centrists may have been channeled by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who slammed fellow Democrats for putting \u201ctheir own narrow political interests above their community.\u201d[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]The sudden unraveling of the Amazon deal on Thursday meant the company\u2019s promise of 25,000 jobs in New York City would be unfulfilled over opposition to the city and state\u2019s offer of $3 billion in tax incentives, which highlighted the practice of luring businesses to states and cities with promises of big tax breaks.\u201cThere are large questions philosophically about whether taxpayers should give billions of dollars to billionaires,\u201d said Gordon Hintz, the Democratic minority leader of the Wisconsin State Assembly, who is a critic of a state deal in 2017 to lure the electronics giant Foxconn with $4 billion in taxpayer subsidies.\u201cThere\u2019s frustration in the public right now where wealth is being concentrated, the opportunities for economic mobility are lower, and they see the people who receive these deals seemingly unconcerned with their reality,\u201d he added.Wisconsin, a battleground state that Mr. Trump narrowly won in 2016 as part of his appeal to white blue-collar voters, is certain to be a crossroads of national Democratic contenders ahead of 2020, as they try to win back some of those voters and excite others who stayed home. That Mr. Trump played a role in the Foxconn deal \u2014 and jumped in again recently when the Taiwan-based company wavered \u2014 is a ready-made target for Democrats inclined to criticize corporate giveaways.Mr. Hintz said the issue played a role in the re-election loss last year of Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican.Even as New York sent Amazon packing, other cities and regions renewed their courtship of the company. On Thursday, Newark officials sent a courier in red to deliver a giant heart-shaped card to the company bearing the Valentine\u2019s Day message that the city and New Jersey \u201cstill love u, Amazon!\u201d[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Mr. Booker, who is seeking the Democratic nomination, has made no comment on the deal. A Democratic county chairman in Iowa, Kurt Meyer, who put Mr. Booker up overnight on a recent swing through the state, predicted that criticisms of large corporations would feature in appeals to the party base there, which is more progressive than in many states. Iowa\u2019s $208 million in incentives for an Apple data center near Des Moines with just 50 jobs was debated in last year\u2019s midterm elections.\u201cI suspect the issue will be exploited extensively in Iowa, due in part to our vague but distinct sense of economic insecurity, which, while unrelated to Amazon and Apple, is pretty dry tinder,\u201d Mr. Meyer said.At a CNN town hall in Iowa last month, Ms. Harris was asked if the existence of multibillionaires was \u201cmorally defensible.\u201d She replied that the 2017 Republican tax cut bill was \u201cunconscionable\u201d for giving breaks to corporations and those in the top 1 percent but excluding working families.Amazon\u2019s decision to cancel its deal with New York also comes at a time when prominent Democratic lawmakers in Washington are crafting legislation and advocating policies that could constrain or even break up large technology companies.In the past two years, big scandals in the technology sector have made privacy and the security of social media networks hotly debated issues. Russian entities used Facebook\u2019s network to try and influence the 2016 presidential election. The Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed that Facebook users\u2019 data had been misused.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat and candidate for president, is sponsoring a bill that would require disclosure about who is paying for online political advertising. Ms. Warren supports antitrust policies. Mr. Sanders\u2019s Stop BEZOS Act, named for the chief executive of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, would tax corporations whose low-wage workers find it necessary to rely on food stamps and government health care benefits.The push to step up regulation may have support among the public. In a Pew Research poll last year, 55 percent of the respondents said technology companies had too much power and influence, compared with 37 percent who said the firms had the right amount.But not every party official believes in shaming corporate chieftains and corporations.In northeast Ohio, Representative Tim Ryan, a Democrat whose district recently lost 1,600 jobs with the shutdown of a plant making the Chevrolet Cruze, wrote a letter on Friday imploring Amazon to build a second headquarters there.Mr. Ryan, in an interview, predicted that everyone at the basketball game he planned to attend Friday night at Howland High School, where his daughter is a cheerleader, would be talking about how to lure Amazon and its jobs to the area.Ohio is a swing state that Democrats, including Senator Sherrod Brown, who is weighing a presidential bid, would like to win back in 2020.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t serve us well to be hostile to business in general,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cWe need them. We can\u2019t reverse climate change. We can\u2019t rebuild manufacturing. We can\u2019t retool work force development without a partnership with the free enterprise system.\u201d"}, {"title": "Payless Shoes to Shut All U.S. Stores and Wind Down Online Operation", "category": "Business", "id": "f41baae7-fa80-419f-9a4f-191faab7fd65", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/business/payless-shoes-stores.html", "publishdate": 20190216, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/business/17payless/merlin_150377817_5c0fdca9-c60c-4f5e-9069-f3733cb0a5ef-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Payless ShoeSource, a once-popular seller of inexpensive women\u2019s footwear and a staple in many suburban shopping malls, is closing all of its American stores.The company said on Saturday that it would begin liquidating all 2,100 of its stores in the United States, including Puerto Rico. Payless is also winding down its online business.The retailer, which filed for bankruptcy two years ago, had already closed hundreds of stores in recent years as its brand lost luster among women searching for deals on shoes. It is the latest mass-market retailer to vanish from the retail landscape.The liquidation of Payless, based in Topeka, Kan., is another example of how bankruptcy has helped retailers shed their debt, but it has not helped many of them restructure their businesses and regain sales.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Bon-Ton, a department store chain, liquidated last summer, after failing to come up viable reorganization plans. Sears narrowly escaped liquidation this month after a judge allowed its chairman and largest lender, the hedge fund manager Edward S.

But e-commerce explains only part of Payless\u2019s challenges. While Payless struggled to stay relevant with shoppers, other retailers catering to bargain conscious shoppers, like TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack, are thriving.Keeping up with emerging fashion trends and creating attractive stores requires constant investment, which was a challenge for Payless. Some of the company\u2019s stores have also been hurt by their location in struggling suburban malls that are anchored by Sears and J. C. Penney, another listing retailer. As hundreds of those anchor stores have closed, traffic to nearby retailers in the malls has slowed.A Payless spokeswoman said that liquidation sales would start on Sunday and that the stores would remain open through the end of March, with many open until May."}, {"title": "All Oscars Will Be Shown Live, Academy Says in a Reversal", "category": "Business", "id": "81afc753-d776-4dee-8b54-70ad04475ea8", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/business/oscars-academy-awards-categories.html", "publishdate": 20190216, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/16/arts/16academy1/merlin_150749952_43e330b2-b912-4b64-8bdf-d7ab543537c0-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 So much for a three-hour Oscar telecast.The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Friday that it would abandon its contentious plan to award four of its 24 trophies during commercial breaks, with the winning moments edited and aired later in the broadcast.

The American Society of Cinematographers rebuked the organization in an open letter signed by dozens of industry figures, including the directors Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. As movie fans blasted the academy on Twitter, stars joined in.For an organization filled with public relations experts \u2014 its marketing and P.R. branch has more than 400 members \u2014 the academy has found itself in nonstop tempests in recent years.Its responses to the #OscarsSoWhite uproars of 2015 and 2016 drew criticism.

There will be no host.Whether its remedies are correct or not, the academy\u2019s leaders know they have to take some kind of drastic action: A record low of 26.5 million people watched last year\u2019s telecast, a drop of nearly 20 percent from a year earlier. As recently as four years ago, the Academy Awards had an audience of 43.7 million viewers. Traditions are wonderful, the organization\u2019s leaders have said, but the television ratings may fall so low that the organization cannot meet its financial obligations.The Oscars telecast is a big business, generating 83 percent of the academy\u2019s $148 million in annual revenue. ABC controls broadcast rights until 2028 at a cost of roughly $75 million a year. The network sought as much as $2.8 million per 30-second commercial for last year\u2019s telecast.A nose-dive in the ratings threatens all of that income, not to mention an erosion of the position of the Oscars in comparison with the more freewheeling Golden Globe Awards.

Congress passed a spending bill to keep the government open before the deadline on Friday, but the legislation only includes $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel-post fencing along the southern border. That\u2019s a fraction of the $5.7 billion for more than 200 miles of steel or concrete barriers that President Trump has been demanding for months. Mr. Trump responded by declaring a national emergency to tap into billions of dollars originally earmarked for other government projects. Critics view this action as an attempt to save face on his wall promises. But the move also raises questions about his executive powers, and will most likely be challenged in the courts. Not Such a Prime LocationAlexa, we hardly knew thee. Amazon abruptly canceled its plan to build a sprawling corporate campus (also known as HQ2) in New York City, citing backlash from government leaders, unions and residents. Although the company promised to bring 25,000 new jobs to the area, that wasn\u2019t enough to drown out critics who opposed the cushy tax breaks and other financial incentives that New York lawmakers used to lure the tech giant to Long Island City, Queens. \u201cA number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward,\u2019\u2019 Amazon said in a statement on Thursday. It still plans to build another campus in Virginia. Tax TurmoilOh look, the dreaded tax forms in your mailbox: It\u2019s that time again. To make this season even more painful, millions of Americans will get smaller tax refunds this year, or find that they owe money despite no changes in their salaries. Yes, the Trump administration\u2019s tax overhaul was supposed to keep more money in your pocket, but the average refund for early filers was down 8.4 percent. What\u2019s going on? For some taxpayers, it\u2019s that certain deductions no longer apply. For others, it\u2019s that less money was withheld from their pay last year. Either way, this isn\u2019t what you want to hear from your accountant, and it could dampen consumer spending in the coming months. FEB. 17-23What\u2019s Next? Buffett Takes StockIf you\u2019re in the market for some corny investment jokes, look no further than Warren Buffett\u2019s annual shareholder letter, which he will post on Saturday along with financial results for his company, Berkshire Hathaway. The third-richest man in the world, Mr. Buffett, 88, has used his yearly letters to deliver dad humor, nuggets of financial wisdom and insights into his big-picture view of the economy since 1965. Many people pore over his words for stock tips, but they\u2019re also worth a gander if you're interested in learning from one of the most successful and experienced private investors in history. What the Fed Was ThinkingRemember when the Federal Reserve suddenly changed its mind about raising interest rates at its January policy meeting and adopted a more hands-off approach that sent markets into fits of glee? The Fed may offer more clues about its flip-flop when the minutes from that meeting become public on Wednesday. The Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, has now indicated that the Fed won\u2019t raise rates again until inflation accelerates \u2014 a reversal of previous policy. Higher rates are intended to keep the economy steady as it grows, so it\u2019ll be interesting to learn why Fed officials felt compelled to take their hands off the levers. The Standoff Drags On. And On.If you hoped that American and Chinese officials might start making some real progress in resolving their trade war, sorry. Yet another round of talks concluded this past week with no resolution in sight, although they will continue this coming week in Washington. Mr. Trump is supposedly considering a 60-day extension to the looming March 2 deadline for a deal. If the world\u2019s two largest economic powers can\u2019t come to an agreement, the United States has threatened to impose punitive tariffs against Chinese goods, hurting consumers in both countries. The upside to giving negotiators more time is obvious: The tariffs could be avoided, or at least put off. The downside is that it leaves companies \u2014 and even entire industries, like soybean farming \u2014 in limbo for even longer. What Else?Surprise, surprise: Prime Minister Theresa May hit another setback over Britain\u2019s fraught exit from the European Union when her own party splintered on Thursday. Speaking of hot water, Facebook may have earned itself a multibillion-dollar fine from the Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations. Elsewhere in big money: JPMorgan will be the first major American bank to roll out its own cryptocurrency, even though its chief executive called bitcoin \u201ca fraud\u201d back in 2017.

The Wisconsin defeat, along with narrow losses in Michigan and Pennsylvania, clinched the election for President Trump and inflicted a devastating wound that still haunts Democrats in Wisconsin and beyond.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]In an already crowded Democratic primary field, Ms. Klobuchar was eager to highlight what her campaign hopes can set her apart: her Midwestern base and her electoral dominance in many rural, red counties in Minnesota populated by the kind of voters who have largely deserted the Democratic Party. She campaigned in Iowa later in the day.\u201cWe\u2019re going to look at each other and look at the challenges we face in this country,\u201d she told an enthusiastic crowd jammed into the Shift Cyclery and Coffee Bar. \u201cThe challenge that we see in both Minnesota and Wisconsin is about the rural-urban divide. What I\u2019ve decided to do in our state is to go to places that maybe we didn\u2019t focus on enough in the last few years. That includes our rural areas.\u201dWhen she announced her candidacy on Sunday in a Minnesota blizzard, she drove home the point: \u201cWe\u2019re starting in Wisconsin because, as you remember, there wasn\u2019t a lot of campaigning in Wisconsin in 2016,\u201d she said. \u201cWith me, that changes.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m going to be here a lot.\u201d It was widely seen as a dig at Mrs. Clinton.She worked quickly to establish her Wisconsin bona fides and to list her engagement with rural issues in the Senate and as a presidential candidate.\u201cI am so pleased to be in Wisconsin, the state where my mother was born,\u201d she said to cheers. Her great-grandparents were cheesemakers, she said, and she visited the state every year of her childhood. She pledged to expand broadband access and demonstrated her knowledge of rural arcana like the margin protection program, which is billed as a safety net for dairy farmers.VideoSenator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, is running for president. Ms. Klobuchar is hoping her Midwestern roots and history of working across the aisle will help her candidacy.CreditCreditJenn Ackerman for The New York TimesShe also name-checked the local high school colors and the local controversy about the college mascot at the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire.Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s focus on the Midwest notwithstanding, Democrats are debating whether the best path to the presidency lies through the three key Midwestern and Northern states Mrs. Clinton lost, or through a combination of newly competitive Sun Belt states including Arizona, Georgia and perhaps Texas.In her Eau Claire talk, she soon pivoted to national issues, emphasizing that she had co-sponsored bills with Republicans on several of her priorities. She ticked off her major issues: climate change, lowering health care premiums and the cost of prescription drugs, immigration as the bedrock of American values, passing privacy laws to rein in technology companies, and the importance of protecting voting rights.\u201cWhat has President Trump done? He\u2019s gone backward, instead of the Wisconsin state motto which is\u201d \u2014 she paused and the crowd chimed in \u2014 \u201cForward.\u201d She pledged to rejoin the international climate treaty on her first day as president. She denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration and emphasized her belief that immigrants are America.Her grandfather, she said, was stopped at Ellis Island \u2014 there was apparently a quota on immigrants from Switzerland \u2014 and instead entered the United States from Canada. On the eve of World War II, he was fearful he would be deported and successfully applied to become a citizen.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if we didn\u2019t have a sane immigration policy in this country,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said.Her message of bipartisanship resonated for several voters who came to hear her speak. \u201cI think she is able to work across the aisle in a way that\u2019s been proven,\u201d said Eileen Immerman, 63, a nurse in Eau Claire and a political independent.Although Ms. Klobuchar made no reference to being a woman in her talk, several voters said her gender was also a draw.\u201cI just want to vote for a woman,\u201d said Inga Orth, 37, a dairy farmer who said she knew little about Ms. Klobuchar but was eager to learn more. \u201cI\u2019m just so sick of men \u2014 middle-aged men. I think it\u2019s crazy that men are having opinions about abortions: It shouldn\u2019t be men who decide on these things.\u201d She said her top priorities were climate change and women\u2019s rights.ImageWhen she announced her candidacy on Sunday in a Minnesota blizzard, she drove home the point: \u201cWe\u2019re starting in Wisconsin because, as you remember, there wasn\u2019t a lot of campaigning in Wisconsin in 2016,\u201d she said. \u201cWith me, that changes.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019m going to be here a lot.\u201dCreditJenn Ackerman for The New York TimesThat sentiment was not confined to women. \u201cI\u2019m ready for a woman in the top spot,\u201d said Eric Holey, a potter in Eau Claire who was delighted that candidates were visiting Wisconsin, since he said he still believes Mrs. Clinton\u2019s failure to visit once she won the nomination contributed to the Democrats\u2019 loss of the state. He will be evaluating candidates in part based on their support for education and health care for all.Indeed, as Ms. Klobuchar made her way through the crowd, posing for selfies, shaking hands and tickling babies\u2019 stomachs, Jackie Christner, a 74-year-old retired teacher who needs insulin shots, pressed her on whether she supported Medicare for all. Ms. Klobuchar said she wanted to work step by step, and supported expanding Medicaid or Medicare. \u201cTo me, that means universal health care,\u201d Ms. Christner said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not totally satisfied. How might she do that? I like to know more.\u201dSeveral voters interviewed shrugged off reports that Ms. Klobuchar had high staff turnover because she was an exceptionally demanding employer. \u201cI think they say that about every woman \u2014 it\u2019s so irritating,\u201d Ms. Orth said. \u201cI\u2019m so sick of hearing that women are demanding. Come on.\u201dMs. Klobuchar\u2019s strong showing in rural Minnesota may offer promising signs in Wisconsin, traditionally divided between the liberal centers of Milwaukee and Madison and the more conservative north. Her potential Midwestern competitors could include Senator Sherrod Brown  of Ohio, who has not yet announced for president, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who has.Wisconsin Democrats are nonetheless relishing the attention, emboldened by last year\u2019s statewide Democratic victories, most notably reclaiming the governor\u2019s office from a staunch conservative, Scott Walker, after eight years, and easily re-electing Senator Tammy Baldwin.\u201cWisconsin is a place of optimism and energy for Democrats,\u201d said Paul Maslin, a longtime Democratic pollster based in Madison. \u201cWe know we\u2019re a big deal. We may decide this.\u201dBut he does not think Ms. Klobuchar can coast on regional loyalty. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to exclude people because they don\u2019t come from the Midwest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way that she gets into living rooms a little bit quicker than other people do, on a basis that\u2019s a little bit more familiar.\u201dUltimately, though, he said \u2014 and voters in Eau Claire confirmed \u2014 Wisconsin voters are looking for someone who can present a vision for the country\u2019s future, with particular attention to health care, the opioid crisis, climate change\u2019s effect on agriculture, plans to halt the region\u2019s declining manufacturing base, trade, and the civil rights of women, gays and lesbians.Nor does he discount Republican strength, having watched the state veer Republican and Democrat over the years. He expects President Trump to court Wisconsin heavily. In a race with so much up in the air, he can predict one thing with certainty: no snubs for his state in this cycle."}, {"title": "On Politics: The Biggest Stories of the Week", "category": "Politics", "id": "f78cb5e4-5324-4c8b-9ca6-5a937fd7f48f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/us/politics/on-politics-the-biggest-stories-of-the-week.html", "publishdate": 20190216, "imageurl": "", "content": "From the border wall fight to conflict with Iran, it\u2019s been a busy week in American politics.

The deal provided much less funding than the proposal President Trump rejected in December, and his border wall took a back seat in Congress\u2019s budget negotiations, which instead focused on the record number of immigrants in detention. (Here are five takeaways from the deal.)Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he was \u201cnot happy\u201d with the deal but that he didn\u2019t think there would be another government shutdown. He sought to reassure supporters that he would not give up on his \u201cbuild the wall\u201d pledge, saying he had \u201coptions that most people don\u2019t understand.\u201dThe Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, persuaded Mr. Trump to agree to the bill, but it came at a price: The president would declare a national emergency to secure wall funding, he told the majority leader \u2014 and Mr. McConnell would have to back him.On Friday, the president declared a national emergency to access billions of dollars to build the wall, transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a fundamental confrontation over the separation of powers.Mr. Trump portrayed his announcement as a routine use of executive authority, but there is no precedent for what he has done. Many in both parties now say that Mr. Trump\u2019s decision would establish a dangerous new model.

It is part of an expanding campaign to undercut the country\u2019s military and isolate its economy.While the United States and Israel have accused Iran of instigating terrorism in the Middle East, Iran itself has also been the target of terrorist attacks.In one of the deadliest attacks in the country in years, a bombing on Wednesday is reported to have killed 41 members of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. The Revolutionary Guards are blaming the United States, suggesting it was no coincidence that it happened as the Trump administration was hosting an anti-Iran-themed meeting in Poland.Also on Wednesday, an indictment on a former United States Air Force counterintelligence agent, Monica Elfriede Witt, was made public.

That\u2019s in addition to a federal investigation examining whether all donations to the fund were reported, and whether any foreigners illegally contributed money.\u2022 A government audit found that because of the recent shutdown, fewer taxpayer calls to the Internal Revenue Service were answered, wait times grew longer and the processing of 87,000 amended tax returns was delayed.\u2022 The House voted on Wednesday to end American military assistance for Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen, condemning a nearly four-year conflict that has killed thousands of civilians and inflicted a devastating famine.\u2022 Tens of thousands of veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan were exposed to toxic substances from open-air trash fires, which some believe caused long-term health problems.

Andrew M. Cuomo fumed that some of his fellow Democrats put \u201cthe state\u2019s economic future\u201d at risk, others inside and outside the party saw the scuttled project as evidence that the left doesn\u2019t understand how to generate growth. In a tweet, Lloyd Blankfein, senior chairman of Goldman Sachs, lashed out at progressive Democrats, labeling them as both \u201canti-progress\u201d and \u201canti-Democratic.\u201dThose views feed into a powerful, long-held narrative popularized by Ronald Reagan that Democratic policymakers had \u2014 as then-Senator Barack Obama put it in 2006 \u2014 become \u201cmore obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing the pie.\u201dFor Republicans, Amazon\u2019s retreat is an opportunity to revive beloved barbs and brand Democrats as \u201cjob killers\u201d who are all too eager to \u201ctax-and-spend.\u201d Lower taxes for investors and business owners, they argue, is what spurs entrepreneurs to create jobs and spread the wealth.ImageA protest last November outside an Amazon store in Manhattan. New York had offered the company nearly $3 billion in subsidies to build a second headquarters in the city.CreditJeenah Moon for The New York TimesFor progressives, defeating a plan that handed tax incentives to a trillion-dollar tech titan is part of a broader effort to discredit what they see as bankrupt economic policies. They argue that workers and the government \u2014 two players that have been relegated to the background \u2014 should be treated as important engines of growth.Many objections raised in New York by critics like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman congresswoman whose Queens district borders the neighborhood where Amazon was headed, align with economic critiques offered by Democratic presidential contenders. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, for example, have frequently railed against the outsize power of corporations and lopsided tax cuts and incentives that favor the wealthy.Ms. Warren called the state subsidies in the Amazon deal \u201ctaxpayer bribes,\u201d while Mr. Sanders said, \u201cThis is what the rigged economy is all about.\u201d New York was offering nearly $3 billion in subsidies to Amazon, a company that last year effectively paid half the 21 percent federal corporate tax rate.At the same time, presidential hopefuls have supported policies that bolster workers and the middle class, like an increased minimum wage and rules that ensure overtime pay, as well as substantial public investment. Democrats on the left are also floating ambitious proposals like free college for all, a federal job guarantee, an industrial plan to retool the country\u2019s energy use and higher taxes on the wealthy.The groundwork for these ideas was prepared in recent years by a network of liberal economists, thinkers and activists at research organizations and universities interested in developing a set of policies to displace supply-side economics and trickle-down theory.\u201cThe interaction between market and collective action is what leads to our prosperity,\u201d said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-prize winning economist who is coming out with a book about growing the economy in the 21st century. Advances in science and technology, for example, rest on basic research that was first funded by the government and then brought to market by the private sector.Mr. Stiglitz argues this is the kind of alternative explanation of how growth occurs that the Democratic Party needs to offer more vocally. Souped-up competition, lower taxes on the wealthy and hands-off financial regulation, he maintains, have failed to deliver on their promise to supercharge the economy and broadly lift incomes.ImageAmazon supporters on the steps of the City Hall in New York in late January.CreditHiroko Masuike/The New York TimesNick Hanauer, a Seattle venture capitalist who was an early investor in Amazon and is now a progressive activist and writer, argues that trickle-down theory should be replaced with what he and Eric Liu, a former adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, call \u201cmiddle-out economics.\u201d\u201cI believe capitalism is the greatest social technology ever created for generating wealth and prosperity,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve confused what\u2019s good for the narrow-short-term interest of a few capitalists for what\u2019s good for capitalism.\u201dThe notion that tax cuts for the rich are what cause economic growth and create a thriving middle class is \u201cboth wrong and backwards,\u201d Mr. Hanauer said. \u201cThe thriving middle class is the cause of economic growth.\u201dThe ideas that are capturing attention, particularly in the run-up to the 2020 election, focus more directly on the fortunes of workers and give the government a much more central role in spurring economic growth and distributing wealth.The approach reaches back to the era of Franklin D. Roosevelt for inspiration. The major effort to alter the course of climate change was purposely named the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d \u2014 after Roosevelt\u2019s signature policy \u2014 precisely for that reason. Several versions of the program exist, but the one introduced by Representative Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts includes \u201ca job guarantee program to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one.\u201dDuring the recession\u2019s grimmest months, President Obama pushed to fast-track a multibillion-dollar stimulus package \u2014 the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 \u2014 aimed at creating jobs and spending money on transportation, technology and energy projects. Although the plan was smaller than several left-leaning Democrats wanted, it rested on a shared assumption that cranking up public investment would get the economy moving and put people back to work.How such policies will play out at a time when the unemployment rate has settled in at a low 4 percent will be a source of tension among the party\u2019s various factions. In the past, Democrats have pushed such stimulants during periods of economic weakness. And specific proposals offered by progressives, whether free college or a wealth tax, cause some Democrats to blanch.ImageA New York City Council finance committee hearing on the Amazon headquarters in January.CreditHiroko Masuike/The New York TimesNonetheless, many Democrats acknowledge that political and business leaders have tended to focus too narrowly on the winners of pro-growth policies like free trade without paying sufficient attention to losers like laid-off factory workers. It\u2019s a theme that President Trump successfully pushed on the campaign trail in 2016.\u201cYou organize the economy so workers have more power that allows them to get fair wages and safe living standards\u201d so they\u2019re not outgunned by corporate power, said Jacob Leibenluft, who led Hillary Clinton\u2019s economic policy team during her presidential campaign and is now executive vice president for policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research institute.Democratic centrists and self-described pragmatists now also widely subscribe to critiques of the dominant economic policies of the last couple of decades \u2014 particularly that tax policy has not produced vigorous growth. A consensus has also taken shape that the government needs to play a larger role in the economy, raising taxes, investing in public institutions and, to some degree, redistributing income.Two pillars of the Democratic establishment \u2014 Lawrence Summers, Treasury secretary during the Clinton administration and the director of President Obama\u2019s National Economic Council, and Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration \u2014 have called for significant public spending on infrastructure, education, health care and more to address slow economic growth and sidelined workers.\u201cGovernment has to play an important role,\u201d said Mr. Furman, who wrote an article with Mr. Summers last month about putting such policies ahead of reducing the deficit. \u201cIf you\u2019re spending more, you have to tax more.\u201dFor many Democrats, the shift to a more activist role is overdue. Yet it also comes at a time when the public\u2019s trust in government has dropped to historic lows, according to a December 2017 report from the Pew Research Center.Only 18 percent of Americans said they trust the federal government to do the right thing \u201cjust about always\u201d or \u201cmost of the time.\u201d"}, {"title": "In Bid to Conquer Oscars, Netflix Mobilizes Savvy Campaigner and Huge Budget", "category": "Business", "id": "f735a07b-282b-4b77-b409-ab7c36c286d9", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/business/media/netflix-movies-oscars.html", "publishdate": 20190217, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/18/business/18netflix-oscars-crop/18netflix-oscars-crop-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Netflix called it \u201c\u2018Roma\u2019 Experience Day.\u201dOn a Sunday in December, the streaming giant rented two soundstages on a historic movie lot in Hollywood to evangelize for \u201cRoma,\u201d Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s art film about a domestic worker in Mexico. Oscar voters perused a museum-style exhibit of \u201cRoma\u201d costumes. Mr. Cuar\u00f3n and his crew sat for hours of panel discussions.Breakfast? Lunch? Provided. There were \u201cRoma\u201d stickers, and \u201cRoma\u201d-stamped chocolates. Attendees were even superimposed into a \u201cRoma\u201d scene to share online.All of it struck some voters as over the top. It was certainly a display of just how badly Netflix wants an Oscar \u2014 and how much faith it has put in the person behind the event, a strategist named Lisa Taback, to get it done.Ms. Taback, 55, is an Oscar-campaign veteran who cut her teeth at Miramax with Harvey Weinstein in the 1990s and whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes best-picture winners like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d \u201cThe Artist\u201d and \u201cSpotlight.\u201d Ted Sarandos, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer, called Ms. Taback \u201cthe best of the best\u201d when he named her vice president for talent relations and awards in July, adding that he wanted to \u201cexpand and deepen our efforts to celebrate the incredible creators and talent who bring their dream projects to Netflix.\u201dThe hiring went off like a sonic boom in Hollywood, reverberating to the highest levels of rival studios. \u201cAwards Landscape Rocked as Netflix Poaches Leading Strategist,\u201d the Hollywood Reporter headline read. Netflix had aided its own awards operation while dealing a blow to competitors by taking a top campaigner off the market.And now the costly Oscar push that Ms. Taback has orchestrated for \u201cRoma\u201d is starting to look historic. Mr. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s film, shot in Spanish and Mixtec and deemed a masterpiece by many critics, heads into the 91st Academy Awards next Sunday as  a strong contender to win the Oscar for best picture. If Netflix notches its first such triumph, \u201cthe game changes forever,\u201d said Marty Kaplan, the Norman Lear professor of entertainment, media and society at the University of Southern California.If a film primarily distributed online wins, the debate in Hollywood about what constitutes cinema is over. It would strike a blow to the big multiplex chains, which have refused to show \u201cRoma\u201d because Netflix offered them an exclusive play period of only three weeks; three months is the norm. As far as box office figures, Netflix has said the film has appeared in about 250 theaters in the United States since it was released on Nov. 21, but it refuses to disclose ticket sales. A win by \u201cRoma\u201d could embolden old-line studios like Universal and Warner Bros. to shorten their own theatrical \u201cwindows.\u201dWinning would also make it easier for Netflix to compete with traditional studios for top filmmakers. (Its lone Oscar for a feature-length film to date has been best documentary, in 2018.) Even victories in lesser categories \u2014 \u201cRoma\u201d has 10 nominations in total and \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs\u201d earned three more \u2014 would buoy the Netflix brand, giving the company a glow of excellence and helping it defend against a coming onslaught of competitors. Disney, WarnerMedia and Apple are all introducing megawatt streaming services this year.Ms. Taback declined to comment for this article. Strategists like Ms. Taback try to avoid the media spotlight, especially before the Oscars, contending that they don\u2019t want to take attention away from the films. Another reason, of course, is that no studio wants to look like it is trying to manipulate voters.With so much at stake, Netflix has empowered Ms. Taback and her colleagues in the company\u2019s publicity department to mount a big, bombastic, back-up-the-Brink\u2019s-trucks campaign. \u201cRoma,\u201d a black-and-white period film with no known stars, cost just $15 million to make, but the company has spent an estimated $25 million to $30 million on promotion. Some rival companies, yowling behind the scenes about overspending by Netflix, insist those figures are conservative. Netflix insiders have howled back, saying that some of its spending has been to advertise \u201cRoma\u201d to consumers.Whatever the cost, the campaign is easily the most lavish in history for a foreign-language film. (No foreign film has ever won best picture.)In truth, no film wins the top Oscar unless it\u2019s paid for. All eight of this year\u2019s nominees have been draped in for-your-consideration campaigns for months. Awards strategists estimate that Warner Bros. has spent around $20 million to promote \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d with that film\u2019s director, Bradley Cooper, flying private to campaign stops in New York, Los Angeles and London. Disney has not been stingy with its campaign for \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d which has included television spots, lavish ads in The Los Angeles Times and stumping by Oprah Winfrey.ImageLisa Taback\u2019s Oscar-steering r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes best-picture winners like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech,\u201d \u201cThe Artist\u201d and \u201cSpotlight.\u201dCreditTodd Williamson/Getty ImagesUniversal sent a bound volume of five books to voters on behalf of \u201cFirst Man,\u201d in addition to an annotated copy of the screenplay. It didn\u2019t help much: \u201cFirst Man\u201d received four Oscar nominations but was shut out of the marquee categories.This has been one of the most rough-and-tumble Oscar seasons in memory. Backstabbing and subterfuge are always part of this game, but the vote-mongering has grown more intense than usual, in part because there has been no clear front-runner for best picture. \u201cBlacKkKlansman,\u201d \u201cRoma,\u201d \u201cGreen Book\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d are in a dogfight for the prize.\u201cCompetition has never been more fierce because it seems there is a battle for the future of Hollywood, the film industry and the Oscars themselves \u2014 not just in terms of saving the telecast from plummeting ratings, but also in terms of Netflix having a seat at the table,\u201d said Sasha Stone, a longtime Oscar observer who runs the blog AwardsDaily. \u201cWhether publicist- or civilian-driven,\u201d Ms. Stone added, whisper campaigns and the resurfacing of old Twitter posts have been widespread.Ms. Taback is not the only awards strategist involved in this year\u2019s race who used to work for Mr. Weinstein, who is credited with turning Oscar campaigning into a blood sport. Tony Angellotti has led the \u201cGreen Book\u201d get-out-the-vote effort; he helped Mr. Weinstein push films like \u201cThe English Patient\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d to best-picture victories in the 1990s. \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d has been steered by Dani Weinstein (no relation), who served as the Weinstein Company\u2019s publicity chief from 2012 to 2016. Cynthia Swartz, who spent the 1990s at Miramax, has been consulting on both \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther.\u201dEven so, Ms. Taback is the only one to work for Netflix, which has poured money into its hunt for Emmys and Oscars on a scale that Hollywood executives say they have rarely if ever seen before. Most studios, for instance, sent a couple of movies on DVD to voters for consideration this season. Netflix sent 17.A Netflix spokesman said this reflected the large number of films the company is now producing, which is why, unlike most Hollywood studios, it decided to bring its entire award effort in-house.Ms. Taback, who grew up in Los Gatos, Calif., where Netflix is based, previously ran her own company, LT-LA Communications, and in recent years worked for studios like Lionsgate, A24, Sony Pictures and 20th Century Fox. She brought her entire LT-LA staff to Netflix, where the awards department now has roughly 20 people.The \u201cRoma\u201d campaign started in some ways on Aug. 13, when Ms. Taback and Netflix\u2019s film publicity chief, Julie Fontaine, got buzz started by inviting a handful of film reporters (this one included) to an off-the-record cocktail party and screening of footage. Mr. Cuar\u00f3n was on hand to chat afterward.Then came screenings for the film at a string of important festivals. As the campaign intensified, Netflix had celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron host \u201ctastemaker\u201d screenings in Hollywood for Oscar voters. There were parties at restaurants like Spago in Los Angeles and the Pool in New York.Additionally, mailers went out to voters of awards groups that are important stops on the route to the Oscars: an elaborate pamphlet containing a digital player that ran the \u201cRoma\u201d trailer on loop; Mexican chocolates with a note (\u201c!FELICES FIESTAS!\u201d) from one of the film\u2019s actresses; a six-pound, $175 book of stills.A barrage of ads in Los Angeles \u2014 in trade publications, on Netflix-owned billboards \u2014 continued for months.Everyone who matters in Hollywood knows Ms. Taback, and they all seem to have a strong opinion. Admirers call her \u201cbrilliant\u201d and \u201cscrappy\u201d \u2014 a \u201cgeneral\u201d who figures out clever ways to connect films to the cultural moment. Detractors complain that she is ruthless and takes more credit for campaigns than she sometimes deserves.\u201cAm I a ruthless tiger about pushing someone out of the way? No. My strategy has never been that,\u201d Ms. Taback told the trade news site Deadline in 2017. \u201cMy strategy has been to be tireless. I\u2019ll take clever over nasty any day of the week.\u201d"}, {"title": "For Wall Street Banks in London, It\u2019s Moving Time", "category": "Business", "id": "ab81df52-5638-4c6d-aac9-3f6af091dbd4", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/business/brexit-banks-wall-street-london.html", "publishdate": 20190217, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/11/business/00BREXITBANKS-2/00BREXITBANKS-2-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "In Paris, an empty Art Deco postal office is on its way to becoming Bank of America\u2019s headquarters for its European brokerage arm.

Germany\u2019s financial center, which wooed financial firms in London with a \u201cFall in love with Frankfurt\u201d video, is welcoming investment bankers from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup.The financial landscape of Europe is changing as banks shift employees and hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of assets from London to new subsidiaries across the bloc in time for Britain\u2019s divorce from the European Union, a process known as Brexit, on March 29.Banks are adjusting contracts with \u201cBrexit clauses\u201d to protect themselves if the separation is chaotic. Lawyers are checking regulations, jurisdiction by jurisdiction, to gird for possible future contractual disputes. Cities across the Continent have been vying for a piece of an industry that represents about 7 percent of Britain\u2019s gross domestic product and more than a million jobs there. Frankfurt, Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg will be the first to secure new business as financial services companies gauge how profitable London remains. In the next months, these cities, along with Madrid and Milan, will find more traders, compliance teams, human resource managers and technology workers in their midst. Amsterdam will become home to more European markets. One big Brexit beneficiary is Dublin, where Bank of America, Citigroup and Barclays are expanding their ranks. \u201cDublin is our headquarters for our European bank now, full stop,\u201d said Anne M. Finucane, vice chairwoman of Bank of America, which employs more than 800 people there. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a return. That bridge has been pulled up,\u201d Ms. Finucane told the European Financial Forum on Wednesday. \u201cFrom a trading perspective, likewise Paris would be the European trading arm.\u201d Since January, there have been near-daily revelations about what Britain stands to lose after leaving the European Union. Britain\u2019s Office for National Statistics this week showed growth last year was the weakest since 2009, and growth in the last quarter was 0.2 percent.Brexit uncertainty was blamed, in part.ImageLondon\u2019s financial district, Canary Wharf. Few expect London to lose its might overnight, but international banks will no longer view it as their best gateway in or out of Europe.CreditAndrew Testa for The New York TimesMany financial companies are redeploying staff by the dozens \u2014 not the hundreds \u2014 because they are waiting to see whether the end is a messy breakup or a phased withdrawal, said David Pascoe, senior vice president for Europe at Cartus, a relocation company that moves 162,000 people a year. So far, banks from the United States have relocated fewer than 1,000 employees from London. But the number could grow to 5,000 as the March deadline approaches, said banking officials and analysts. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing such a diverse range of cities because banks are saying they\u2019re not going to be caught out again by having all their operations in one city,\u201d Mr. Pascoe said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want one country upsetting their operations again.\u201dFew expect London, a dominant player in cross-border lending and foreign-exchange trading, to lose its might overnight. But international banks will no longer view London as their best gateway in or out of Europe. The fragmentation of the industry will weigh on companies and Europe\u2019s wider economy. The cost of building and running operations in different locations could filter through to clients, making financial services more expensive. Bank of America alone has spent $400 million moving assets and workers to Dublin and Paris, it said this week.The effects could be worse in Britain if the economy deteriorates significantly and borrowing becomes more expensive. The country is staring down Brexit but also trying to end austerity measures that have been in place for over a decade, a big challenge. In a worst-case scenario, the Bank of England calculated in November that Brexit could shrink the economy by 8 percent and send house prices plunging by 30 percent. British banks could suffer if a souring economy leads to nonpayment and defaults on mortgages, according to S&P. ImageMark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said uncertainty over Brexit was weighing on the financial system. CreditAndy Rain/EPA, via ShutterstockMark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, last week said the \u201cFog of Brexit\u201d and its uncertainty were \u201cweighing more heavily on activity, predominantly through lower business investment and tighter financial conditions.\u201dWhat is certain is that London is poised to lose some ability to move money around easily between its neighbors.Passporting, which allows firms in one European member state to offer their services across the entire bloc, will no longer be available to Britain after Brexit. This has prompted banks to open subsidiaries and offices in well-positioned European Union capitals.Lenders have spent hours writing through lending agreements to mitigate the loss of passporting rights. Countries including France, Germany and Italy have legislation in the works to give banks some leeway if their transfer arrangements are not completed in time, a sort of \u201cmopping-up exercise to make sure nothing falls between the gaps,\u201d said Susan Whitehead, a lawyer specializing in corporate lending at Hogan Lovells in London. There are also forecasts that the entire European Union will suffer. By 2030, the new barriers between the British and European Union markets could shave some 60 billion euros a year from financial firms\u2019 productivity, according to an estimate by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\u201cFrom the perspective of the banks, it is layering on another cost of doing business,\u201d Barney Reynolds, a financial services lawyer in London with Shearman & Sterling, said of Brexit.Still, bank executives in the United States have sounded a calming note when asked about their Brexit plans. They have characterized the political brinkmanship and stuttering negotiations as inconsequential to their operations. Most began planning for a no-deal exit soon after the 2016 referendum that set Brexit in motion, according to advisory firms consulting with the banks.In January, Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief executive, James Gorman, said in an analyst call that he hardly worried about Brexit: \u201cThat\u2019s not in my top 200 issues today.\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s new German-based securities trading subsidiary won provisional approval from credit rating agencies last year, along with several other banks.ImageBanking executives in the United States, like James Gorman, chief executive of Morgan Stanley, were less worried about Brexit. CreditSasha Maslov for The New York TimesStill, it could be a different story if the economic fallout is severe. \u201cThe real risk is the macroeconomic risk rather than a regulatory risk,\u201d said David Pinto-Duschinsky, who works in London for Promontory Financial Group, a consulting firm. \u201cIf there is no deal, it will be large shock to the economy.\u201dBig global banks are expected to be resilient. But volatile markets and weaker economic activity could eat away at earnings, said Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency. The potential fallout has some banks inserting clauses into new contracts to guard against a no-deal exit. Such clauses are intended to secure a process for handling unforeseen events related to Brexit, said Jennifer J. Kafcas, a finance lawyer in London at McGuireWoods. Some borrowers have asked for clauses in their loan agreements to prevent banks from wiggling out of commitments by claiming that Brexit created a \u201cmaterial adverse change\u201d in conditions, said Ms. Whitehead of Hogan Lovells. Banks too have been careful with framing the language of such clauses: they want to retain the right to recover loans further down the line. \u201cIf that borrower loses access to markets or its supply costs rocket, the banks would not want to see that their carve-out stops them taking action,\u201d Ms. Whitehead said. \u201cKnowing that Brexit is on the horizon, they would\u2019ve thought about what impact it would have on their business going forward. But nobody has a crystal ball.\u201d The European Union has prepared legislation, in the case of a no-deal Brexit, for transactions like derivatives clearing. Many banks in London have protectively asked their clients to sign over derivatives contracts to new jurisdictions. Britain and Switzerland have also signed a deal to recognize each other\u2019s insurance regulations. These measures are the beginning of what could be a decade of realignment. \u201cAt the moment, they\u2019re working on the solutions to allow them to continue servicing clients in the hard Brexit scenario,\u201d said Vishal Vedi, a partner in the risk advisory practice at Deloitte. But, he added, \u201cthe footprint will look very different in five years.\u201dEmily Flitter and Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting."}, {"title": "Bernie Sanders Stumbled With Black Voters in 2016.

Mr. Sanders had won 14 percent of the black vote there compared with 86 percent for Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls.Over seven pages, the team outlined a strategy for winning black voters that included using social media influencers and having Mr. Sanders give a major speech on discrimination in a city like St. Louis or Cincinnati.Mr. Sanders\u2019s inner circle did not respond.In a campaign in which Mr. Sanders badly needed his message against inequality to catch fire with black voters, the senator from Vermont and his senior leaders struggled to prioritize and execute a winning plan to build their support. Top aides lost faith in their African-American outreach organizers, whose leadership was replaced and whose team members were scattered across the country. Initiatives like a tour of historically black colleges and universities fizzled; Mr. Sanders even missed its kickoff event.As Mr. Sanders prepares to announce another run for the White House as early as this week, his weak track record with black voters \u2014 a vital base in the Democratic Party \u2014 could be a potential threat to his candidacy. And his campaign\u2019s experience in 2016, as described in interviews with nearly two dozen current and former advisers and staff members, reveals a strikingly uneven commitment on the part of Mr. Sanders and his top advisers to organize and communicate effectively with black voters and leaders.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]For 2016, Mr. Sanders initially put together an all-white leadership team and campaigned heavily in predominantly white states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which vote early in the nomination process. The relationship between his inner circle and his black staff members frayed, and it is unclear if top Sanders aides were aware of the damage until it was too late.As the primary season unfolded, Mrs. Clinton dealt Mr. Sanders a series of stinging defeats in Southern states with high black turnout, while African-American leaders repeatedly criticized the Sanders campaign for failing to understand the concerns and priorities of their constituents.This year, Mr. Sanders is already dealing with another thorny problem involving his 2016 staff: allegations from women who say they were mistreated or harassed during the campaign. Last month, after The Times published an investigation into complaints by female staff members, Mr. Sanders publicly apologized.The two issues could make Mr. Sanders vulnerable in a crowded and diverse Democratic primary field that includes several female and minority candidates.ImageJohn Solomon was hired as an organizer on Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign team but soon became disillusioned when aides assigned him to drive people around Iowa.CreditZack Wittman for The New York TimesAdvisers to the senator maintain that the African-American outreach team had plenty of resources and was a victim of its own inefficiency.\u201cThe black people had the largest team \u2014 the Latino outreach team didn\u2019t even have that many people,\u201d said Symone Sanders, who took over black outreach efforts after the South Carolina primary. \u201cAnd then what did they do with the resources? They squandered it.\u201dDissatisfaction among black staff members on the 2016 campaign was reported at the time, including by Fusion. But fresh interviews show that many former black employees still feel frustrated that they were not taken seriously or provided with the resources they needed to succeed \u2014 even though some continue to admire Mr. Sanders.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they didn\u2019t need us for anything,\u201d said John Solomon, who was hired as an organizer but soon became disillusioned when campaign aides assigned him to drive people around Iowa in a truck. \u201cIt was kind of like, you have black staff just to say you have black staff.\u201dThis tension spilled over into other areas of the campaign, particularly among local staff members in South Carolina, who worked closely with the African-American outreach team. Some black campaign workers described microaggressions \u2014 subtle interactions that, while not overtly discriminatory, still played on racial prejudice. One woman said her boss almost never spoke to her.[Who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out: Keep up with the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]Mr. Sanders appears committed to strengthening ties with the black community since his loss to Mrs. Clinton. He has made multiple trips to the South, and last month he spent Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday in South Carolina, where he spoke at the Capitol and met with black leaders, elected officials and students.At the same time, the senator\u2019s advisers are conscious that any future presidential campaign would need a much more diverse staff, especially in its upper ranks. Last month, Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders\u2019s former campaign manager and currently a senior adviser, acknowledged to The Times that the 2016 staff had been \u201ctoo male\u201d and \u201ctoo white.\u201dMr. Weaver declined to comment for this article. Friends of Bernie Sanders, the senator\u2019s campaign committee, said in a statement that Mr. Sanders \u201cremains committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace, politics and in policy.\u201dThe group also said it was having conversations and conducting training with human resources consultants and current and former staff members \u201cwith the goal of safe, inclusive and equitable policies that reflect the work and values of Senator Sanders.\u201dImageDanny Glover, a liaison to historically black colleges and universities, introduced a tour he believed could solidify support from young black voters, but he felt that the campaign did not make a full commitment to it.CreditBenjamin Rasmussen for The New York TimesIn any political campaign, the internal competition for resources can be fierce, and getting the ear of the candidate\u2019s top aides is difficult.In 2016, this frustration was particularly acute for those working on Mr. Sanders\u2019s African-American outreach efforts. Many had joined with the goal of bringing the candidate\u2019s populist message into black communities.Danny Glover, a liaison to historically black colleges, introduced a tour he believed could solidify support from young black voters.But Mr. Sanders did not attend the kickoff event at South Carolina State University, and the campaign often sent surrogates rather than the senator himself. The budget for the tour was soon cut, Mr. Glover said, and the events that were held were scaled back.\u201cIt was kind of disappointing,\u201d Mr. Glover said, adding, \u201cI just think back to the opportunities we left on the field for lack of investment into it.\u201dThe senator\u2019s campaign committee said that Mr. Sanders \u201cdeeply cares about H.B.C.U.s\u201d and that the United Negro College Fund planned to honor him next month.Other staff members shared similar accounts of disappointment.When Mr. Solomon joined the campaign in late 2015, he was told his job would include networking with black voters and planning events in black communities. But almost immediately he was assigned tasks like keeping itineraries and chauffeuring surrogates that had little to do with outreach \u2014 which made him feel like \u201csupport staff,\u201d he said.Roy Tatem, the deputy director of the outreach team, said that higher-ranking aides, including Mr. Weaver, rarely interacted with the group as a whole and that there was a constant push and pull for resources.Mr. Sanders\u2019s \u201cheart has been consistently in the right place,\u201d Mr. Tatem said. But he added that over time campaign leaders deprioritized black voters, especially after the South Carolina primary defeat. \u201cThe narrative became \u2018Bernie cannot win black voters,\u2019\u201d he said.ImageSupporters attended a rally for Mr. Sanders at Morehouse College in Atlanta in 2016, part of a tour of historically black colleges and universities.CreditKevin D. Liles for The New York TimesAfter South Carolina, Symone Sanders, who is black (and is not related to the senator), was put in charge of winning over black voters. She said she knew that the outreach team was frustrated but added that \u201ca large part of it is a lack of understanding for what the process and protocols should have been.\u201dShe said the loss in South Carolina was partly because the campaign got there too late to overcome Mrs. Clinton\u2019s built-in advantage, reflecting an overall disorganization. But she also said the outreach team did not adequately support on-the-ground workers there.\u201cThey did not deliver,\u201d she said in an interview.Top aides said the campaign invested heavily in the outreach team, including giving it its own office in Atlanta.\u201cThe individual roles of African-American outreach staff members changed as the campaign grew and the calendar progressed, as they did in every department,\u201d the senator\u2019s campaign committee said.Advisers to Mr. Sanders say he is committed to having a more diverse campaign staff should he run again, and there have been signs he is trying to build his relationship with the black community. During his trip to South Carolina last month, he spoke to students at Benedict College, a historically black college, and met with clergy members and members of the state\u2019s legislative black caucus.Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, was with Mr. Sanders on Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday and said the tone of the senator\u2019s speech was different from that of his past speeches.\u201cIn South Carolina before, his speeches did not lend themselves to being embraced by the African-American community,\u201d Mr. Clyburn said. Mr. Sanders\u2019s recent speech, in which he called President Trump a racist, \u201cshowed much more sensitivity to the dreams and aspirations of African-Americans than his speeches did in 2016,\u201d Mr. Clyburn said.Separately, Mr. Sanders has been reaching out to black leaders \u2014 including Chokwe Antar Lumumba, the mayor of Jackson, Miss., and Derrick Johnson, the president of the N.A.A.C.P. \u2014 to discuss issues that affect black communities, like economic justice and voter suppression.But he has had some missteps, too. Some critics cited recent remarks he made suggesting that white voters who were uncomfortable voting for black candidates were \u201cnot necessarily racist.\u201d Others said his decision to deliver his own rebuttal to the State of the Union address was disrespectful to Stacey Abrams, a rising Democratic star and the first black woman chosen to give the official response.Many former staff members said that above all, if Mr. Sanders runs in 2020, they wanted to see the makeup of his campaign staff \u2014 and whether people of color are empowered \u2014 before they were willing to assess his progress.\u201cHe can start with the hiring process,\u201d Mr. Glover, the college tour organizer, said. \u201cThose first hires are going to let a lot of us know if he learned from the 2016 cycle.\u201d"}, {"title": "Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Native American Ancestry Draws a Shrug From These Voters", "category": "Politics", "id": "cff92222-b64c-4350-9eec-2edc7cd596d8", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-native-american.html", "publishdate": 20190218, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/19/us/19warren-voters-hp-promo/19warren-voters-hp-promo-articleLarge-v4.jpg", "content": "LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. \u2014 Anna Stein, 44, doesn\u2019t have a preferred presidential candidate yet for the 2020 Democratic nomination. But one thing is certain, she says: Elizabeth Warren\u2019s handling of her Native American ancestry claims will not factor into her decision.A.J. McConnell, 70, suspects he\u2019ll vote for Kamala Harris, the California senator, for president. But he thinks the criticism over Ms. Warren describing herself as Native American for years is unfair, because he also had family members who once identified as Native Americans.Bobbie Pate, 69, arrived at a Warren rally in northern Georgia on Saturday a little worried that Ms. Warren would mention the ancestry issue. Even acknowledging it would give credence to President Trump\u2019s \u201cracist attacks\u201d on Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator she said. (Mr. Trump routinely slurs her as \u201cPocahontas.\u201d)\u201cEverybody makes mistakes,\u201d Ms. Pate said of Ms. Warren\u2019s bumpy handling of her ancestry. \u201cBut it\u2019s small potatoes compared to what Trump had done.\u201dIn interviews over the last month with about three dozen Democratic voters, many in early primary states, almost all of them expressed far more interest in Ms. Warren\u2019s policy ideas than her ancestry and said that they were exhausted or uninterested by the story line. They described it as overblown, reflecting a disconnect between voters in the party\u2019s base and some political elites, media commentators and conservatives who have been preoccupied with the issue.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]\u201cRight now is a time to listen to ideas,\u201d said Holly Sauers, a staunch Democrat and resident of Charleston, S.C. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.\u201dAmong these voters, who were mostly white and black Democrats who acknowledged their own misunderstandings about Native American communities and history, Ms. Warren is not a perpetrator of harm, but a victim of a Washington culture that delights in any scandal among politicians \u2014 and particularly elected officials who are women.ImageMs. Warren spoke Saturday in Greenville, S.C. Whether the ancestry issue would be a problem for Ms. Warren with general election voters if she won the Democratic nomination is unclear at this early stage.CreditTravis Dove for The New York TimesCiting the 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton, the first woman to be nominated for president from either major party, many Democrats \u2014 including those not predisposed to Ms. Warren \u2014 expressed particular protectiveness of their candidates this cycle. That instinct has extended not only to Ms. Warren, but also to other Democratic presidential candidates such as Senator Harris, who has faced questions about her own views, and more recently Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has been accused of sharply criticizing some of her own staff members.\u201cThis time, we don\u2019t want to focus on the negativity,\u201d said Ms. Stein, who attended Ms. Harris\u2019s rally on Friday in Charleston. She said she felt that the talk of Ms. Warren\u2019s Native ancestry was driven by Mr. Trump.\u201cHe\u2019s just so loud and gets people to focus on whatever he says,\u201d Ms. Stein added.It was Ms. Warren who decided last year to highlight the ancestry issue, by giving interviews that repeatedly defended her family\u2019s story that they originated from Cherokee and Delaware tribes and by taking a DNA test that showed strong evidence that she has Native American pedigree \u201c6-10 generations ago,\u201d according to results released by Ms. Warren\u2019s office. After some Native leaders said she dishonored tribal governments and citizens by using the DNA test to assert her own ancestry claims, and some critics on the left said that the test played into Mr. Trump\u2019s hands, Ms. Warren apologized multiple times this month for calling herself Native American for years.Whether the ancestry issue could be a problem for Ms. Warren with general election voters if she won the Democratic nomination is unclear at this early stage. For now, the issue has become a familiar narrative among Washington insiders: Republican Party officials are trying to brand her as inauthentic, and some liberal activists have expressed dismay with her approach to the whole issue. Most painfully for Ms. Warren, some prominent Native Americans have soured on her, saying she exhibited unforgivable behavior consistent with cultural appropriation. (Other Native leaders have been more supportive.)[Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]Ms. Warren may well face new questions about the extent of her Native claims. But criticism of her has been cooling in some quarters recently, after Ms. Warren\u2019s apologies and her steps to consult privately with prominent critics to understand their concerns.Ms. Warren briefly appeared at the National Indian Women Honor luncheon last week in Washington to support a Native leader from Massachusetts, who was winning an award. She is also working on legislation with Representative Deb Haaland, the New Mexico Democrat who last year became one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress; it would seek to address funding shortfalls in tribal lands.Julian Brave Noisecat, a Native American journalist and activist who has criticized Ms. Warren previously, said: \u201cBased on my conversations with tribal leaders and advocates, the consensus position is that she\u2019s one of the strongest allies of Indian country in Congress. She has good relationships with tribes across the board. And I think that\u2019s relevant.\u201dMr. Noisecat said the ancestry matter had become double-edged: More than any other Democratic presidential candidate, Ms. Warren has caused the most upset among Native American communities, but has also probably done the most outreach and is more vocal on issues that effect tribal citizens than other presidential candidates.He said though the ancestry issue had been largely discussed as a political problem, he hoped that its main impact was educational, and that more people learned about the thorniness of claiming Native ancestry without being a member of a tribe. Mr. Noisecat also acknowledged that his willingness to forgive Ms. Warren may not be universal.ImageA sign in support of Ms. Warren at the rally in Las Vegas. On the campaign trail, there have been relatively large and enthusiastic crowds for Ms. Warren so far.CreditBridget Bennett for The New York Times\u201cShe definitely made a mistake,\u201d he added.Mar\u00eda Urbina, the national political director of the progressive group Indivisible, said she and other liberal leaders were encouraged by Ms. Warren\u2019s decision to apologize. Going forward, Ms. Urbina said she expected liberal activists to take their cues from Native leaders on whether Ms. Warren had adequately addressed their concerns.\u201cNative leaders and native people should be the ones to affirm \u2014 or not affirm \u2014 whether her record shows if she\u2019s been an ally,\u201d Ms. Urbina said. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely important.\u201dOn the campaign trail, there have been relatively large and enthusiastic crowds for Ms. Warren so far, including in states like Georgia and Nevada that are far away from her northeastern base. At every event, she has also held a lottery where questions are drawn at random to answer; she has been asked just more than 100 questions so far, according to her campaign, and two have been about her ancestry.This does not surprise Neera Tanden, the president of Center for American Progress, a liberal nonprofit group. Ms. Tanden, a former adviser to Mrs. Clinton, said she expected Democrats to stay away from criticizing their own during this cycle.\u201cThere\u2019s a strong belief among Hillary voters that the negativity during the primary hurt her during the general,\u201d Ms. Tanden said. \u201cAnd people do not want to go through that again.\u201dThis could change, of course, if Ms. Warren were to ascend to the Democratic nomination and went head-to-head with Mr. Trump while coming under intense scrutiny across the political spectrum.At her Georgia campaign appearance, a group of conservative protesters gathered across the street from the Central Gwinnett High School gymnasium in Lawrenceville, where Ms. Warren was speaking. \u201c1/1024th chance of winning,\u201d read one sign, in reference to the small portion of Native American ancestry Ms. Warren\u2019s DNA test revealed she could have. During the event, too, one heckler loudly accused her of lying; Ms. Warren brushed aside the comments and went on with her remarks.Jerald Joseph, a 72-year-old Georgia resident, was dismissive of the criticism of Ms. Warren, saying he thinks Mr. Trump attacks her only because \u201che\u2019s afraid of her.\u201d\u201cThis is what he does, but it\u2019s what\u2019s in the heart that counts,\u201d Mr. Joseph said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she lied. And in the end, we\u2019re all the same and if her values are contrary to Trump, that\u2019s what matters.\u201d"}, {"title": "Kamala Harris Faces Questions About \u2018Democratic Socialist\u2019 Label and Jussie Smollett in N.H.

Barack Obama, who had never been to New Hampshire before running for president, visited the state in December 2006, about 13 months before its 2008 primary.Ms. Harris knew that her lack of time in the state might raise eyebrows, and she addressed it head-on at the town hall meeting in Portsmouth.\u201cLet me address the elephant in the room,\u201d she began, then laughed, saying that there were no elephants \u2014 the mascot of the Republican Party \u2014 in this particular room.\u201cI intend to compete in New Hampshire,\u201d she declared. \u201cI intend to spend time here. I intend to shake every hand I possibly can,\u201d she said to wild applause from the hundreds of people packed into the large sanctuary of Portsmouth\u2019s historic South Church.And, she said, \u201cI intend to do very well in New Hampshire.\u201dThat drew big applause, too, but it was a careful hedge. Ms. Harris is fully aware that her challengers for the Democratic nomination are likely to include one if not two fellow senators from neighboring states: Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts has already announced her candidacy, and Bernie Sanders from Vermont is expected to announce soon. New Hampshire has a long history of favoring New England candidates.Despite Mr. Sanders\u2019s popularity here \u2014 he won 60 percent of the vote in the 2016 primary \u2014 Ms. Harris distanced herself from him at an earlier event in Concord. Asked if she would have to tack to the left like Mr. Sanders to do well in New Hampshire, she drew a line in the sand.\u201cThe people of New Hampshire will tell me what\u2019s required to compete in New Hampshire, but I will tell you I am not a democratic socialist,\u201d she said. Mr. Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist, a label that some prominent Democrats have also embraced, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.During that visit in Concord before the town hall, Ms. Harris also seemed unsure at first when she was asked about a message from her Twitter account on Jan. 29 about Mr. Smollett, whose story about being attacked in Chicago by two men yelling racist and homophobic comments is now under investigation by the police. Chicago news media outlets have reported that detectives are reviewing whether the attack Mr. Smollett reported had been a hoax.\u201cWhich tweet? What tweet?\u201d Ms. Harris said in response to the question about her use of the \u201cmodern day lynching\u201d phrase. After a moment, she said, \u201cI think the facts are still unfolding and I\u2019m very concerned\u201d about the initial allegation by Mr. Smollett. She said \u201cthere should be an investigation\u201d and declined to comment further until it was complete.At Ms. Harris\u2019s town hall in Portsmouth, people squeezed in from wall to wall and lines stretched down the street for two blocks; there was an overflow crowd outside was turned away. Most members of the audience, which varied widely in age and was predominantly white, enthusiastically leapt to their feet repeatedly to applaud her liberal positions, even if she often lacked detail.Ms. Harris said America was not working for working people, that health care costs were driving people to near bankruptcy and that she supported \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d She blasted the pharmaceutical companies for an \u201cimmoral\u201d system in which they \u201cgouge the public\u201d and are more concerned with profits than public health. Although she was not asked about the state\u2019s opioid crisis, one of the worst in the country, she brought it up a couple of times.She railed against gun violence, described climate change as man-made and endorsed the Green New Deal. She lamented that money that should be spent on public education was instead going to mass incarceration. She endorsed comprehensive immigration reform.In an answer to a question, she said she would support changes in voting laws that would allow for same-day registration and make Election Day a national holiday. In answer to another question, she said she supported renaming Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day.Some answers were more vague than others. One questioner, noting that the Democrats generally appeal to voters on the coasts, asked her how she would appeal to the heartland.\u201cI reject the notion that depending on where you were born, you don\u2019t identify with someone else,\u201d she responded. \u201cThis election will come down to who the American public believes will be a leader.\u201dThe audience also responded heartily to her veiled references to President Trump, whom she did not name. They rose to their feet and cheered when she denounced \u201chis vanity project,\u201d the wall on the southern border with Mexico.Although Ms. Harris\u2019s lack of history in the state might fly in the face of New Hampshire tradition, it does not seem to have hindered her in the slightest.\u201cThere was some question about whether she was going to campaign here,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Leary, 62, a retired insurance manager. \u201cBut she made that commitment to retail politics, and that\u2019s what people here expect.\u201d He called her \u201cfantastic.\u201dMs. Harris has already hired a state campaign director, Craig Brown, as well as a political director here, Meredith Shevitz.Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, said that with Ms. Warren and possibly Mr. Sanders in the race, New Hampshire was not an essential win for Ms. Harris, which may partly explain her late start.\u201cA third-place showing here would be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cFor her, South Carolina is more of a make-or-break state.\u201dAnd in any event, he said, \u201cshe has California waiting for her,\u201d referring to the earlier-than-usual 2020 primary in her home state that could play a major role in the nomination contest."}, {"title": "Chinese and Iranian Hackers Renew Their Attacks on U.S. Companies", "category": "Business", "id": "faa3304b-7dab-4ec3-a401-08351128c4cd", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/technology/hackers-chinese-iran-usa.html", "publishdate": 20190218, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/18/business/17hack-1-print/00hack05-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Businesses and government agencies in the United States have been targeted in aggressive attacks by Iranian and Chinese hackers who security experts believe have been energized by President Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal last year and his trade conflicts with China.Recent Iranian attacks on American banks, businesses and government agencies have been more extensive than previously reported. Dozens of corporations and multiple United States agencies have been hit, according to seven people briefed on the episodes who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.The attacks, attributed to Iran by analysts at the National Security Agency and the private security firm FireEye, prompted an emergency order by the Department of Homeland Security during the government shutdown last month.The Iranian attacks coincide with a renewed Chinese offensive geared toward stealing trade and military secrets from American military contractors and technology companies, according to nine intelligence officials, private security researchers and lawyers familiar with the attacks who discussed them on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.A summary of an intelligence briefing read to The New York Times said that Boeing, General Electric Aviation and T-Mobile were among the recent targets of Chinese industrial-espionage efforts. The companies all declined to discuss the threats, and it is not clear if any of the hacks were successful.Chinese cyberespionage cooled four years ago after President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China reached a landmark deal to stop hacks meant to steal trade secrets.ImageA 2015 deal between President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China that curtailed hacking intended to steal trade secrets appears to have been unofficially canceled.CreditDoug Mills/The New York TimesBut the 2015 agreement appears to have been unofficially canceled amid the continuing trade tension between the United States and China, the intelligence officials and private security researchers said. Chinese hacks have returned to earlier levels, although they are now stealthier and more sophisticated.\u201cCyber is one of the ways adversaries can attack us and retaliate in effective and nasty ways that are well below the threshold of an armed attack or laws of war,\u201d said Joel Brenner, a former leader of United States counterintelligence under the director of national intelligence.Federal agencies and private companies are back to where they were five years ago: battling increasingly sophisticated, government-affiliated hackers from China and Iran \u2014 in addition to fighting constant efforts out of Russia \u2014 who hope to steal trade and military secrets and sow mayhem. And it appears the hackers substantially improved their skills during the lull.Russia is still considered America\u2019s foremost hacking adversary. In addition to meddling widely and spreading disinformation during United States elections, Russian hackers are believed to have launched attacks on nuclear plants, the electrical grid and other targets.Threats from China and Iran never stopped entirely, but Iranian hackers became much less active after the nuclear deal was signed in 2015. And for about 18 months, intelligence officials concluded, Beijing backed off its 10-year online effort to steal trade secrets.But Chinese hackers have resumed carrying out commercially motivated attacks, security researchers and data-protection lawyers said. A priority for the hackers, researchers said, is supporting Beijing\u2019s five-year economic plan, which is meant to make China a leader in artificial intelligence and other cutting-edge technologies.\u201cSome of the recent intelligence collection has been for military purposes or preparing for some future cyber conflict, but a lot of the recent theft is driven by the demands of the five-year plan and other technology strategies,\u201d said Adam Segal, the director of the cyberspace program at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThey always intended on coming back.\u201dOfficials at the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Segal and other Chinese security experts said attacks that once would have been conducted by hackers in China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army are now being run by China\u2019s Ministry of State Security.These hackers are better at covering their tracks. Rather than going at targets directly, they have used a side door of sorts by breaking into the networks of the targets\u2019 suppliers. They have also avoided using malware commonly attributed to China, relying instead on encrypting traffic, erasing server logs and other obfuscation tactics.ImageTwo Chinese citizens who are suspected of participating in an extensive hacking campaign to steal data from American companies.CreditManuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press\u201cThe fingerprint of Chinese operations today is much different,\u201d said Priscilla Moriuchi, who once ran the National Security Agency\u2019s East Asia and Pacific cyber threats division. Her duties there included determining whether Beijing was abiding by the 2015 agreement\u2019s terms. \u201cThese groups care about attribution. They don\u2019t want to get caught.\u201dIt is difficult to quantify the number of industrial-espionage attacks, in part because they have been designed mostly to steal strategic trade secrets, not the kind of personal information about customers and employees that companies must disclose. Only Airbus has acknowledged in recent weeks that Chinese hackers had penetrated its databases.Many of the attacks by the Chinese Ministry of State Security have been against strategic targets like internet service providers with access to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of corporate and government networks.Last week, Ms. Moriuchi, who is now a threat director at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, released a report on a yearlong, stealth campaign by the ministry to hack internet service providers in Western Europe and the United States and their customers.The lone hacking target to publicly confront the ministry was Visma, a Norwegian internet service provider with 850,000 customers. The goal of the attack on Visma was to gain broad access to its customers\u2019 intellectual property, strategic plans and emails, including those of an American law firm that handles intellectual property matters for clients in the automotive, biomedical, pharmaceutical and tech sectors, according to Recorded Future.The Visma attack was harder to trace than earlier incidents, which typically started with so-called spearphishing emails meant to steal personal credentials. This assault began with stolen credentials for a third-party software service, Citrix. And instead of using malware easily traced to China, the attackers used malware available on the so-called Dark Web that could have come from anywhere. They also used the online storage service Dropbox to move stolen emails and files.Federal agencies are also trying to fend off new Iranian espionage campaigns.After  the Trump administration pulled out of the nuclear deal, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, testified before Congress that her agency was \u201canticipating it\u2019s a possibility\u201d that Iran would resort to hacking attacks.ImageStuart Davis, a director at a subsidiary of the security firm FireEye, which has attributed a recent wave of cyberattacks to Iranian hackers.CreditKamran Jebreili/Associated PressThe Iranian attacks, which hit more than a half-dozen federal agencies last month, still caught the department off guard. Security researchers said the hacks, which exploited underlying weaknesses in the internet\u2019s backbone, were continuing and were more damaging and widespread than agency officials had acknowledged.Iranian hackers began their latest wave of attacks in Persian Gulf states last year. Since then, they have expanded to 80 targets \u2014 including internet service providers, telecommunications companies and government agencies \u2014 in 12 European countries and the United States, according to researchers at FireEye, which first reported the attacks last month.The current hacks are harder to catch than previous Iranian attacks. Instead of hitting victims directly, FireEye researchers said, Iranian hackers have been going after the internet\u2019s core routing system, intercepting traffic between so-called domain name registrars. Once they intercepted their target\u2019s customer web traffic, they used stolen login credentials to gain access to their victims\u2019 emails. (Domain name registrars hold the keys to hundreds, perhaps thousands, of companies\u2019 websites.)\u201cThey\u2019re taking whole mailboxes of data,\u201d said Benjamin Read, a senior manager of cyberespionage analysis at FireEye. Mr. Read said Iranian hackers had targeted police forces, intelligence agencies and foreign ministries, indicating a classic, state-backed espionage campaign rather than a criminal, profit-seeking motive.There is a long history of Iranian attacks against the United States, and episodes from five years back or longer are just now being made public.On Wednesday, the Justice Department announced an indictment against a former Air Force intelligence specialist, Monica Witt, on charges of helping Iran with an online espionage campaign. Four members of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were also charged with \u201ccomputer intrusions and aggravated identity theft\u201d directed at members of the United States intelligence community.Also last week, the Treasury said it was putting sanctions on two Iranian companies, New Horizon Organization and Net Peygard Samavat Company, and several people linked to them. Treasury officials said New Horizon set up annual conferences where Iran could recruit and collect intelligence from foreign attendees.Ms. Witt attended one of the conferences, the indictment says. Net Peygard used information she provided to begin a campaign in 2014 to track the online activities of United States government and military personnel, Treasury officials said.Representatives for Iran\u2019s Mission to the United Nations did not respond to requests for comment.The recent Iranian attacks have unnerved American officials. But after issuing the emergency order about the ones last month, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has largely played them down.An official with the cybersecurity agency said there was a belief that no information had been stolen and that the attacks had not \u201cmaterially impacted\u201d operations. But Mr. Read of FireEye and others said there had been a noticeable escalation in Iran\u2019s digital espionage.\u201cIf you tell the Iranians you\u2019re going to walk out on the agreement and do everything you can to undermine their government,\u201d said Mr. Brenner, the former counterintelligence official, \u201cyou can\u2019t be surprised if they attack our government networks.\u201d"}, {"title": "Honda Confirms Plan to Leave Britain as Brexit Looms", "category": "Business", "id": "51ff71a7-b13e-4601-bc28-cee2062711ce", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/business/brexit-honda.html", "publishdate": 20190218, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/19/business/19HONDAUK-01/19HONDAUK-01-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LONDON \u2014 The Japanese automaker Honda has become the latest business to make plans to leave Britain as global forces reshape the car industry and the country prepares to exit the European Union.Honda will close its plant in Swindon, England, which employs 3,500 workers, by 2021, it confirmed on Tuesday. The factory, which produces about 150,000 cars a year, will close once its current line of Civic cars comes to an end. \u201cIn light of the unprecedented changes that are affecting our industry, it is vital that we accelerate our electrification strategy and restructure our global operations accordingly,\u201d Katsushi Inoue, the chief officer for European operations, said in a statement.

Justin Tomlinson and Robert Buckland, two members of Parliament representing the Swindon area who had been in contact with Honda, said in a joint statement that they were \u201cdisappointed and surprised\u201d that the plant would be gone in two years.\u201cHonda have told us today that they will be consulting with all staff and there is not expected to be any job losses or change in production until 2021,\u201d the lawmakers said in an emailed statement on Monday. \u201cAll European market production is being consolidated to Japan, where the company is based.\u201d They said production in Turkey would also be affected.Honda follows other companies that have retrenched in the face of sluggish markets, tougher environmental regulation and challenges from deep-pocketed technology companies that are pursuing electric and autonomous driving cars. Last month, Ford said it was cutting thousands of jobs across Europe as emissions rules and declining demand ate into its profits. Another American carmaker, General Motors, pulled out of Europe in 2017 after persistent losses in the region. But the losses in Britain, coming as the country tries to leave the European Union, have been striking. Nissan said in early February that it would be producing the next generation of its X-Trail SUV at its Kyushu plant in Japan, rather than at its factory in Sunderland, England. The plant will continue to manufacture other models.Like Nissan, Honda stands to benefit from a new trade deal between the European Union and Japan, which will make it easier to produce cars in Japan for export to the bloc. Their production lines in Japan will also be closer to markets viewed as having greater growth potential, like China and Indonesia.The sales market is changing across the globe. Car sales to individual customers appear to have peaked in the United States last year. An economic slowdown in China has deflated sales there. Silicon Valley tech companies are increasingly competing for talent among manufacturers.\u201cAll of that is taking a huge amount of resource out of car companies,\u201d said Peter Wells, a professor at the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at Cardiff Business School. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to access those new markets, restructure their operations; it\u2019s an enormous burden financially. It\u2019s putting strain on the whole sector.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all going on around this industry and it\u2019s proving to be a turbulent strategic time for the participants,\u201d he said. The continued stalemate over Brexit has made it more difficult for businesses to plan their operations past March 29, the day of departure. Investment in the country\u2019s auto industry plummeted by half in 2018, prompting a recent plea from the automakers\u2019 trade association. \u201cBrexit is the clear and present danger and, with thousands of jobs on the line, we urge all parties to do whatever it takes to save us from \u2018no deal,\u2019\u201d said Mike Hawes, the organization\u2019s chief executive, referring to the prospect of the country leaving the European Union without an agreement over the terms of departure. The Honda decision is one of a series of unhappy announcements in Britain in recent months. The British carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has said it would be cutting 4,500 people from its work force because of \u201cgeopolitical and regulatory disruptions.\u201d Dyson, the appliances company known for its vacuum cleaners, is moving its headquarters from southwest England to Singapore as it prepares to bring an electric vehicle to the market. Nissan\u2019s chairman in Europe, Gianluca de Ficchy, said that the company\u2019s decision to adjust its assembly line was not based solely on Brexit but \u201cthe continued uncertainty around the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the E.U. is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future.\u201dHonda\u2019s operations in Britain are highly dependent on being connected to the European Union; the company had already said it would close its factory temporarily in case no-deal Brexit triggered chaos. About 40 percent of the components that Honda uses at the Swindon factory come from the European Union, while 35 percent of its exports are sent to the region, according to Patrick Keating, the government affairs manager at Honda Motor Europe. Mr. Keating told a parliamentary committee in 2017 that Honda had \u201cabout 2 million components a day coming in on 350 trucks\u201d from Europe. Unite, a trade union representing the workers, was quick to blame Brexit when the closure was initially reported on Monday. It said in a statement that \u201cthe chickens were coming home to roost big-time because of the Brexit uncertainty caused by the chaotic Tory government.\u201d The organization\u2019s national officer for the automotive sector, Des Quinn, added that \u201cthis would be a shattering body blow at the heart of U.K. manufacturing.\u201d Stanley Reed and Stephen Castle contributed reporting.

Mr. Axelrod confirmed in an interview that he briefed the gathering, recalling: \u201cThey asked me about Obama endorsing. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t imagine he will.\u2019\u201dMr. Axelrod said he had been sharing his own perspective, not speaking as an official Obama emissary. But his forecast matches what Mr. Obama has told friends and likely presidential candidates in private: that he does not see it as his role to settle the 2020 nomination, and prefers to let the primary unfold as a contest of ideas. Michelle Obama, the former first lady, also has no plans to endorse a candidate, a person familiar with her thinking said.Even former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. does not expect to secure Mr. Obama\u2019s backing if he runs, according to allies of Mr. Biden\u2019s.Yet if Mr. Obama has all but officially taken a vow of neutrality, he remains the party\u2019s most convincing model for success at the national level, and continues to shape the mind-set and strategy of Democratic presidential candidates.[Who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out, who might be in. Check out the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]He has counseled more than a dozen declared or likely candidates on what he believes it will take to beat President Trump, holding private talks with leading contenders like Ms. Harris, Mr. Booker and Senator Elizabeth Warren; underdogs like Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind.; and prominent figures who remain undecided on the race, like Eric H. Holder, his former attorney general, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York.ImageBeto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas Senate candidate, told Oprah Winfrey that former President Barack Obama spoke candidly with him about the personal strain of running for president.CreditKathy Willens/Associated PressDuring these informal conversations, usually at his office in Washington, Mr. Obama has offered a combination of supportive advice and sober warnings, cautioning candidates that running for president is a more punishing process than they could ever imagine, according to seven people who have spoken with him directly or were briefed in detail on the meetings.Mr. Obama continues to express frustration that he did not anticipate Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, these people said, even after years of clashing with the forces of right-wing populism as president. He has urged candidates to push back on Mr. Trump\u2019s bleak and divisive rhetoric about economic change, and to deliver a competing message that can resonate even in Republican-leaning areas, courting rural voters and other communities that tend to distrust Democrats.Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said the former president was encouraged by the \u201cdiverse, experienced and principled\u201d field of candidates taking shape, and said Mr. Obama had been \u201chappy to speak privately with candidates seeking his guidance on the best way to lead the country.\u201d\u201cPresident Obama counsels candidates to always show up and make their case even in areas or in front of audiences they may not necessarily win; express views and positions that reflect their genuine beliefs; and share a positive vision for the country true to their own personal story,\u201d he said.The discreet role Mr. Obama is taking reflects his longstanding ambivalence about acting as a partisan political leader, and has the potential to disappoint Democrats who pine for him to intercede more decisively. Known for his lack of interest in intraparty wrangling when he was president, Mr. Obama has privately voiced both an impatience to move on from politics and an urgent sense of responsibility to do what he can to thwart Mr. Trump.Some Democrats still hope Mr. Obama might help resolve the primary in an active way, perhaps if the contest narrows to just two candidates and he believes one of them cannot beat Mr. Trump. Steve Westly, a California investor who was a major fund-raiser for Mr. Obama, said he expected the race to \u201ccome down to two or three candidates very quickly\u201d and foresaw an opening for Mr. Obama to act.\u201cI am sure he feels, as an American, that he wants to make sure the Democratic Party puts up the best possible candidate,\u201d Mr. Westly said.ImageSenator Kamala Harris of California is among the leading contenders Mr. Obama has met with.CreditJim Wilson/The New York Times[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Mr. Obama has indicated to candidates that he worries about the possibility of a damaging primary fight, and has urged them to avoid attacking each other in bitterly personal terms that could help Mr. Trump. He has also hinted that he sees a relatively open space for a more moderate Democrat, given the abundance of hard-charging liberals in the race.Democrats have kept the meetings almost entirely confidential, out of deference to Mr. Obama. Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas Senate candidate, briefly described his session with the former president in an interview with Oprah Winfrey this month, recalling that Mr. Obama spoke with disarming candor about the personal strain of running for president. Mr. O\u2019Rourke said Mr. Obama had not lobbied him to run.\u201cYou asked if he encouraged me to; he did not,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cBut he was very generous in sharing what his thought process was, leading up to that decision.\u201dOther candidates have declined to share details of their meetings with Mr. Obama, but invoke him reverently on the campaign trail. Mr. Booker drew laughter and applause from a crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last weekend, when he declared: \u201cI miss Obama \u2014 and I miss her husband, too!\u201dThe primary will represent something of a test for Mr. Obama\u2019s brand of politics, if perhaps not of his influence within the party. He is personally revered by many Democrats, and his achievements like the Affordable Care Act, the Paris climate agreement and the regulations he imposed on banks and coal companies are seen as sacrosanct by most liberals.But Mr. Obama\u2019s party has also plainly moved leftward on core matters of policy since his term ended, and some factions have grown contemptuous of the consensus-seeking approach Mr. Obama took as president. The coming primary campaign may hinge in part on whether Democratic voters favor making gradual improvements to Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy or pursuing more disruptive policy changes like enacting single-payer health care.Mr. Obama\u2019s doctrine of nonintervention could represent a setback, though not an unexpected one, to Mr. Biden. The former vice president and his political allies have confided to potential supporters that they do not expect Mr. Obama to issue an endorsement in the primary, for Mr. Biden or anyone else.ImageSenator Cory Booker drew laughter and applause from a crowd in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, last weekend, when he declared, \u201cI miss Obama \u2014 and I miss her husband, too!\u201dCreditTamir Kalifa for The New York TimesBut the two men have discussed the race, and allies of Mr. Biden hope Mr. Obama might speak favorably about Mr. Biden\u2019s service as his running mate and vice president, people who have spoken to Mr. Biden\u2019s inner circle said.Bill Russo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, declined to comment.In public and private, Mr. Obama has spoken admiringly about a few potential presidential candidates as they burst upon the national scene, applauding signs that a newer generation of leaders is rising in the party. He has told friends that Mr. O\u2019Rourke and Mr. Buttigieg represent precisely that kind of generational change, and expressed deep admiration for Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans, for his approach to removing Confederate statues in his city.After campaigning in Georgia last fall, Mr. Obama described Stacey Abrams, the party\u2019s nominee for governor in 2018, as one of the most impressive candidates he had encountered.And Mr. Obama took a keen interest in Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, when he was considering a presidential run last year. A former civil rights lawyer with moderate instincts, Mr. Patrick spoke repeatedly with Mr. Obama before announcing in December that he would not run, citing the strain a campaign would impose on his family.Mr. Obama has spoken out selectively since leaving office, usually focusing on themes related to the integrity of the political system. He campaigned widely in the midterm elections, focusing many of his endorsements on promoting women and candidates of color, and he has taken a leading role in a group set up to fight congressional gerrymandering, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. Mr. Obama is expected to help raise money in the coming months for the organization, said a spokesman for the group, which is helmed by Mr. Holder.To some veteran Obama supporters, there is a certain irony to Democrats wishing that Mr. Obama would act as an old-school party leader and decree his preferences from on high.Rufus Gifford, a top Obama fund-raiser who served as ambassador to Denmark, suggested that the diversity of the Democratic candidates was a consequence of Mr. Obama\u2019s pathbreaking presidency. He said the 2020 field was a tribute to the former president, even if it left voters and donors struggling to parse their options.\u201cYou look at the number of women, the racial diversity, the diversity of experience, the different levels of public service \u2014 I think a lot of that can and should be attributed to the legacy of Barack Obama,\u201d Mr. Gifford said."}, {"title": "On Politics: Trump\u2019s Emergency Declaration Divides Republicans", "category": "Politics", "id": "8a2fa408-2c99-4ad3-905c-4786322a167d", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/us/politics/trump-border-national-emergency.html", "publishdate": 20190218, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Monday morning.

Europe has been the most aggressive in taking on Silicon Valley, but a tougher approach is gaining ground in the United States, where the Federal Trade Commission is considering imposing a multibillion-dollar fine against Facebook, and lawmakers have called for new data-privacy regulations.The parliamentary report recommends the creation of a British watchdog to oversee the technology industry, similar to the country\u2019s approach to regulating media companies. It also suggested legally requiring Facebook and other large internet platforms to remove what the government determines to be harmful content, or risk fines or other punishments.Silicon Valley has long opposed making tech companies responsible for content on their sites. The industry argues that websites like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are simply unbiased platforms for others to share material, and that new restrictions could impede free speech.\u201cSocial media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a \u2018platform\u2019 and maintain that they have no responsibility themselves in regulating the content of their sites,\u201d the parliamentary report said.Facebook acknowledged past mistakes and said it was open to \u201cmeaningful regulation.\u201d\u201cWhile we still have more to do, we are not the same company we were a year ago,\u201d said Karim Palant, a public policy manager for Facebook in Britain. \u201cWe have tripled the size of the team working to detect and protect users from bad content to 30,000 people and invested heavily in machine learning, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to help prevent this type of abuse.\u201dThe blistering report concludes the committee\u2019s work, which started as a study of how social media can be manipulated to influence elections like Britain\u2019s 2016 vote to exit the European Union, but became a closer examination of Facebook\u2019s business practices. The committee held several hearings related to Facebook\u2019s relationship with Cambridge Analytica, the voter-targeting firm that gained access to 87 million Facebook users.The committee does not have lawmaking authority on its own, but Mr. Collins said in an interview that he hoped the recommendations would be incorporated into a broader review of technology regulation underway within the British government. Policymakers are debating new rules to prevent online election meddling, and the spread of hate speech and terrorist content.A British parliamentary committee would not typically cause much worry for a company of Facebook\u2019s size, but the panel became a persistent challenge for the social media company.Mr. Collins has threatened to force Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to testify if he ever travels to Britain. In December, the committee released a trove of secret internal emails in which Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives discussed sharing access to user data with certain companies, like Netflix and Airbnb, while cutting off others.The committee said the emails showed Facebook\u2019s willingness to sacrifice user privacy to maximize revenue and generate more money from advertising. Without new oversight, technology companies cannot be expected to change, the report concluded.\u201cThe big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight,\u201d the report said. \u201cBut only governments and the law are powerful enough to contain them.\u201d"}, {"title": "When Your Hotel Is Overbooked, You Might Be \u2018Walked\u2019 to Another", "category": "Business", "id": "a0d0f195-6ca2-4dd2-925c-e5e9218de38a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/business/hotels-overbooked-walking-travel.html", "publishdate": 20190218, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/19/business/19ITINERARIES-01/merlin_150858264_574142a2-a09f-49cb-b989-e58ff0a438d8-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The term in the travel industry is \u201cwalked.\u201dThat\u2019s when a hotel tells a traveler with a confirmed reservation that it does not, in fact, have an available room and instead books a room for the guest at another hotel.\u201cWalking\u201d is not new. According to hotel industry experts, however, it has been on the rise as the strong economy drives up hotel occupancy rates. At the same time, hotels have been under pressure to maximize their revenues, experts say. To do that, hotels, much as airlines do, try to predict who will not show up or cancel at the last minute. Sometimes, they guess wrong.While hotels are not under any legal obligation to the guests they walk, it is industry policy to book guests a room in a comparable property and pay for that room, according to Reneta McCarthy, a senior lecturer at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University.Still, some travelers, like Paul Lanyi, a marketing contractor from Los Angeles, argue that a free night\u2019s stay may not be worth the hassle. Mr. Lanyi said he had a confirmed reservation at the Waterfront hotel in Oakland, Calif., a couple of years ago. But when he tried to check in close to midnight, the front desk employee told him that the property was oversold and no more rooms were available.To make matters worse, he recalled, the employee said that he hadn\u2019t yet been able to find alternative accommodations. Luckily, the employee was able to secure a room at a nearby hotel, but Mr. Lanyi, who was on a business trip, said he didn\u2019t end up going to bed until 2 a.m. \u201cI had to wake up for an 8:30 a.m. meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not fun.\u201dThe hotel\u2019s general manager, Chris Offutt, said that \u201cduring oversold situations, which are infrequent and largely due to high demand in the area, the hotel works to ensure guests are comfortably accommodated at a nearby comparable hotel.\u201d She added, \u201cWaterfront is committed to caring for our guests.\u201dMs. McCarthy said, \u201cIf you\u2019re a leisure traveler, you might be O.K. staying at another property that you don\u2019t have to pay for. But, she added, \u201cBusiness travelers aren\u2019t paying for their room anyway, so they don\u2019t care as much.\u201dWhile there are no official statistics on how many travelers get walked, and individual hotels are generally mum on the subject for fear of hurting their reputation and business, Bjorn Hanson, an adjunct professor at the Tisch Center of Hospitality at New York University, said a big reason walking was increasingly problematic was that hotel occupancy was at a high.He said his research showed that 2019 was expected to have the highest hotel occupancy percentage since 1981 \u2014 more than 66 percent of the available rooms in the United States were expected to be occupied on an average night. In 2009, by comparison, 54.6 percent of rooms were occupied, according to the travel research company STR. On weekdays this year in business travel markets, Dr. Hanson said, he expected occupancy percentages in the 90s.\u201cIn periods of high occupancy, hotels overbook more hotel rooms, which results in more guests getting walked,\u201d Dr. Hanson said.Walking is also growing because hotels are under increasing pressure to make as much money as they can, said Rummy Pandit, the executive director of the Lloyd D. Levenson Institute of Gaming, Hospitality and Tourism at Stockton University in New Jersey. \u201cThe supply side is growing faster than the demand side so hotels have more competition,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re also getting competition from home rental companies like Airbnb.\u201dSTR and Tourism Economics\u2019 forecast for this year projects a 2.3 percent increase in revenue per available room, to $87.94. This would be the lowest year-over-year percentage change in that metric since the end of the financial crisis in 2009.\u201cIn the current climate, hotels will overbook by 10 to 15 percent of their room capacity, which will result in more guests being walked,\u201d Dr. Pandit said. \u201cProperties use revenue management systems that estimate no-shows and cancellations, in additional to several other parameters, but these are only estimates.\u201dDr. Pandit estimated that a 500- to 700-room property is likely to walk five guests on high occupancy days.As to determining which hotels in which city are most likely to \u201cwalk\u201d a traveler, Dr. Pandit said: \u201cThe probability of being walked is not necessarily dependent on the size of city. It would generally depend on demand and supply of hotel rooms at any particular time, and the specific policy of the operator in terms of overbooking in order to maximize occupancy.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cIf you have to pick cities, I would say the chances of being walked are greater in large cities with higher number of year-round peak occupancy days.\u201dSome hotels try to assuage guests they have \u201cwalked\u201d by giving them gifts.Katie Perkins, who is a front officer manager at the Four Seasons Hotel Westlake Village near Los Angeles, said that when she had to walk a business traveler, she tried to offer something meaningful. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s a massage, or, if they want to come back on a personal trip, I offer them an upgrade to a suite,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next day, I call them to apologize again.\u201dMs. Perkins added some companies that have a contract with the hotel for a negotiated rate include a clause that states that none of its employees can be walked.How properties decide who gets walked depends on a number of factors. Ms. McCarthy said that men have a higher chance of being walked than women, solo travelers are more at risk than a couple or a family, and travelers with a reservation for one night have a higher chance than those staying multiple nights.Travelers checking in late in the day also have a greater likelihood of being walked.Dr. Hanson advised guests with confirmed reservations to arrive at their hotel at or soon after the official check-in time when more rooms are available. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be getting there late, call the property, reconfirm your reservation with a live person whose name you get and tell them when you\u2019ll be arriving,\u201d he said.Being part of a hotel\u2019s loyalty program, if it offers one, can also protect travelers, and if they are walked, the loyalty program may give them added benefits.Marriott International, for example, has six tiers as part of its Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program and offers a cash gift card and loyalty points to walked members at all tiers, except the entry level basic. The amounts vary based on the Marriott brand. Walked travelers who are part of the second tier, called Silver Elite, with a reservation at a JW Marriott or W Hotels receive $200 and 90,000 points.

Mr. Honig said he was walked in October when he checked in for a two-night stay at the Courtyard Santa Monica. \u201cThe hotel was willing to put me up at a Le Meridien for one night but wanted me to come back there for the second night, which would have been a pain,\u201d he said.Following a lengthy back-and-forth with the front desk employee, Mr. Honig managed to get the property to approve a second night\u2019s stay at Le Meridien. \u201cIt took a lot of my time and energy, but I have to admit, the compensation Marriott offered helped make the situation better,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "A Real Tube Carrying Dreams of 600-M.P.H.

In Mr. Sanders, who has not joined the Democratic Party, Republicans have an easy target to try to make the face of the opposition.But Mr. Sanders, 77, starts with stronger support from small-dollar donors and liberal voters than most other candidates. And he is among the best-known Democrats in a crowded field, as well as one of the most outspoken against President Trump, whom he has repeatedly called a \u201cpathological liar\u201d and a \u201cracist.\u201d\u201cDuring our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda, we were told that our ideas were \u2018radical\u2019 and \u2018extreme,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sanders said on Tuesday in an email to supporters. \u201cThree years have come and gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.\u201d[Update: Bernie Sanders accuses liberal think tank of smearing progressive candidates.]This time around, Mr. Sanders, enters the race at a far different electoral moment. Much of his populist agenda has been embraced by other Democrats, at a time when many voters are eager to elevate female and nonwhite standard bearers. He will no longer have the Clinton dynasty as a foil; instead, his competition will include progressives like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has broadly supported many of the same economic positions for years.And he will face far more scrutiny than three years ago, when much of the news media and political class treated him as more of an outlier than as a genuine challenger for the nomination. Already, he has had to quell the unease about his campaign\u2019s treatment of women that has been disclosed in recent weeks and prompted two public apologies. His stumbles on issues of race and identity continue to concern activists who fear he has learned little from his previous White House bid.Whether Mr. Sanders can break through in a crowded field of diverse candidates, many of whom champion the progressive message he made popular, could go a long way in determining the direction of the Democratic Party in the age of Trump.\u201cA lot of people still believe that he is the one who can take Trump out,\u201d said Yvette Simpson, chief executive of the political group Democracy for America. The question now, she said, is \u201chow does he distinguish himself in that bigger field?\u201dThe 2020 Democratic Field Is the Largest in Modern HistorySee how the current Democratic presidential field compares with past cycles.Republicans have seized on Mr. Sanders\u2019s entrance, eager to ascribe the socialist label to all Democrats. Soon after his announcement, the Trump re-election campaign issued a statement denouncing \u201cevery\u201d Democratic candidate for \u201cembracing his brand of socialism.\u201d The president said pointedly that Mr. Sanders \u201cmissed his time.\u201dIn an interview on \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d Mr. Sanders did not shy away from calling himself a democratic socialist. Mr. Trump, Mr. Sanders said, is \u201cgoing to say, \u2018Bernie Sanders wants the United States to become Venezuela.\u2019\u201d\u201cBernie Sanders does not want to have the United States become the horrific economic situation that unfortunately exists in Venezuela right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat Bernie Sanders wants is to learn from countries around the world why other countries are doing a better job of dealing with income and wealth inequality than we are.\u201dMr. Sanders will start with several advantages, including the foundation of a 50-state organization; a massive lead among low-dollar donors that is roughly equivalent to the donor base of all the other Democratic hopefuls combined; and a cache of fervent, unwavering supporters who spent the day exulting in his decision to run. A coveted speaker, he can still electrify crowds in a way few politicians can. He enjoys wide name recognition, and several early polls had him running second behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.The strength of that donor list was quickly apparent: In the 12 hours after Mr. Sanders formally joined the race, his campaign said it had pulled in more than $4 million.[Check out the 2020 Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]And while rising stars like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley have siphoned some of his authority over the party\u2019s progressive wing, Mr. Sanders still claims to have spawned a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d that, true revolution or not, has ignited a generation of young, socialist-leaning voters and reshaped the Democratic Party.He is also partly responsible for the party\u2019s decision last year to overhaul its presidential nomination process, including sharply reducing the influence of superdelegates and increasing the transparency around debates \u2014 factors he felt greatly favored Hillary Clinton in 2016.Asked what would be different in 2020, Mr. Sanders replied bluntly: \u201cWe\u2019re going to win.\u201d\u201cBottom line,\u201d he said, \u201cit is absolutely imperative that Donald Trump be defeated.\u201d Though he had harsh words for the president, he said he was fond of the five other senators who were running for the Democratic nomination. \u201cThey are in some cases my friends,\u201d he said.VideoSenator Bernie Sanders is embarking on a second run for president. This time the field will be bigger, more diverse and filled with candidates who have adopted his progressive populist mantle.CreditCreditSam Hodgson for The New York TimesMr. Sanders did not immediately announce where he would campaign first. Faiz Shakir, the national political director at the A.C.L.U. and a former adviser to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the former majority leader, will serve as campaign manager.With his booming voice and familiar wide-armed grip at the lectern, Mr. Sanders has long positioned himself as a champion of the working class and a passionate opponent of Wall Street and the moneyed elite. His remarks often include diatribes against the millionaires and billionaires \u2014 one of his most common refrains is that the \u201cthree wealthiest people in America own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent\u201d \u2014 as well as denunciations of \u201csuper PACs\u201d and the influence of big money on politics. In particular, he has sharply criticized Amazon and Walmart over their wages and treatment of workers.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]In his email to supporters, as well as a campaign announcement video, Mr. Sanders laid out a litany of policy issues, familiar to anyone who has followed him: universal health care, tuition-free public college, women\u2019s reproductive rights, lower prescription drug prices, criminal justice reform.\u201cOur campaign is about taking on the powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life,\u201d he said.While some presidential candidates have avoided direct broadsides against President Trump, Mr. Sanders, ever combative, addressed his potential opponent head on.\u201cWe are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction,\u201d he said.Born in Brooklyn, with an accent to match, Mr. Sanders ran unsuccessfully in the 1970s for governor and United States senator in Vermont before being elected mayor of Burlington in 1981. For 16 years, he served as the only congressman in the state before he was elected to the Senate in 2006.Mr. Sanders has been a modest legislator and something of a lone wolf in Washington, promoting largely the same legislative agenda since his early days as a mayor. He voted against the Iraq War and, in 2008, was one of roughly two dozen senators to vote against the $700 billion bailout of big banks.ImageSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont marched with others from a prayer service at Zion Baptist Church in Columbia, S.C., to the state house last month during an event on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.CreditTravis Dove for The New York TimesWhile often viewed as a pesky left-wing gadfly, he is also known to reach across the aisle, working on legislation with Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Senator John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans. He has rationalized voting for the 1994 crime bill, now heavily criticized for some of its draconian provisions, by saying he had favored progressive parts of the bill, including the Violence Against Women Act, while strongly opposing measures that would lead to mass incarceration.Mr. Sanders is the longest-serving independent in congressional history, a point of pride for him but one of consternation and annoyance for some Democrats who are quick to suggest he does not have the party\u2019s interests at heart. Some Democrats blame him for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss in 2016, saying his anti-establishment rhetoric during his campaign inflamed divisions in the party that proved insurmountable.One 2016 issue that has resurfaced is his record on gun control, Democratic strategists have said, given the intensity of the debate around gun violence following recent mass shootings. In 2005, Mr. Sanders voted for a law that granted immunity to gun manufacturers and dealers from most liability lawsuits. Mr. Sanders has also been criticized for support he received from the N.R.A. when he was running for Congress in 1990, in part because he vowed not to support a bill that mandated a waiting period for handgun sales.Though his message is well worn, Mr. Sanders has indicated that he is trying to remedy weaknesses from his first presidential campaign, including his lack of support from black voters. In recent months, he has made a series of trips to the South, where in 2016 he drew less than 20 percent of the black vote. During the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, he made a swing through South Carolina \u2014 where black voters made up about 60 percent of the Democratic primary vote in 2016 \u2014 that included addressing supporters and students and speaking with lawmakers.He has also tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials, becoming a critic of the United States support of Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen. Late last year, the Senate passed a resolution, which Mr. Sanders helped introduce, to end American military assistance for the kingdom\u2019s war there.But he also continues to draw ire from critics who say that the way he talks about race and identity is out of step with the calls for diversity and change within the party.Almost immediately after making his announcement, Mr. Sanders was attacked for his response to a question on Vermont Public Radio about whether he thought he best represented the current Democratic Party.\u201cWe have got to look at candidates, you know, not by the color of their skin, not by their sexual orientation or their gender and not by their age,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI think we have got to try to move us toward a nondiscriminatory society which looks at people based on their abilities, based on what they stand for.\u201dWhether Mr. Sanders can secure the Democratic nomination may depend on his ability to change his timeworn message \u2014 and adapt to the demands and yearnings of a party that he helped shape.\u201cBefore 2016, nobody was really talking about universal health care and universal education as much as he was; he really brought that into the mainstream for a lot of people,\u201d said Dave Degner, the chair of the Tama County Democratic Party in Iowa. \u201cIf he comes out saying the same things that he did before, it\u2019s not new anymore.\u201d"}, {"title": "YouTube Unleashed a Conspiracy Theory Boom.

Among them: that iPhones secretly record their owners\u2019 every utterance; that popular children\u2019s TV shows contain subliminal messages urging children to commit suicide; that the recent string of deadly wildfires in California was set on purpose, either by homeowners looking to collect insurance money or by the military using a type of high-powered laser called a \u201cdirected energy weapon.\u201dNone of this was fact-based, of course, and some of the theories seemed more like jokey urban legends than serious accusations. Still, his fans ate it up. The video has gotten more than 30 million views, a hit even by Mr. Dawson\u2019s standards. A follow-up has drawn more than 20 million views and started a public feud with Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s, the restaurant chain, which was forced to deny claims that it recycles customers\u2019 uneaten pizza slices into new pizzas.Mr. Dawson\u2019s conspiracy series arrived at a particularly awkward moment for YouTube, which has been reckoning with the vast troves of misinformation and extreme content on its platform.In late January, the company announced that it was changing its recommendations algorithm to reduce the spread of \u201cborderline content and content that could misinform users in harmful ways.\u201d It cited, as examples, \u201cvideos promoting a phony miracle cure for a serious illness, claiming the earth is flat or making blatantly false claims about historic events like 9/11.\u201dMr. Dawson, whose real name is Shane Lee Yaw, has more than 20 million subscribers and a devoted teenage fan base. He has built his lucrative career by, among other talents, understanding what kinds of content plays well on YouTube.For years, that meant conspiracy theories \u2014 lots and lots of them, all delivered with the same wide-eyed credulity. In a 2016 video, he wondered aloud if the first Apollo moon landing was staged by NASA. (\u201cIt\u2019s a theory,\u201d he said, \u201cbut, I mean, all the evidence is not looking good.\u201d) In 2017, he discussed the false theory that the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were a hoax. (\u201cI know it\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut just look at some of these videos.\u201d) And last year, he devoted a segment of a video to flat-earth theory, which he concluded \u201ckind of makes sense.\u201dIn fairness, Mr. Dawson is a far cry from partisan cranks like Alex Jones, the Infowars founder, who was barred by YouTube and other social networks last year for hate speech. Most of Mr. Dawson\u2019s videos have nothing to do with conspiracies, and many are harmless entertainment.But the popularity of Mr. Dawson\u2019s conspiracy theories illuminates the challenge YouTube faces in cleaning up misinformation. On Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms, the biggest influencers largely got famous somewhere else (politics, TV, sports) and have other vectors of accountability. But YouTube\u2019s stars are primarily homegrown, and many feel \u2014 not entirely unreasonably \u2014 that after years of encouraging them to build their audiences with viral stunts and baseless rumor-mongering, the platform is now changing the rules on them.Innocent or not, Mr. Dawson\u2019s videos contain precisely the type of viral misinformation that YouTube now says it wants to limit. And its effort raises an uncomfortable question: What if stemming the tide of misinformation on YouTube means punishing some of the platform\u2019s biggest stars?A representative for Mr. Dawson did not respond to a request for comment. A YouTube spokeswoman, Andrea Faville, said: \u201cWe recently announced that we\u2019ve started reducing recommendations of borderline content or videos that could misinform users in harmful ways. This is a gradual change and will get more and more accurate over time.\u201dPart of the problem for platforms like YouTube and Facebook \u2014 which has also pledged to clean up misinformation that could lead to real-world harm \u2014 is that the definition of \u201charmful\u201d misinformation is circular. There is no inherent reason that a video questioning the official 9/11 narrative is more dangerous than a video asserting the existence of U.F.O.s or Bigfoot. A conspiracy theory is harmful if it results in harm \u2014 at which point it\u2019s often too late for platforms to act.Take, for example, Mr. Jones\u2019s assertion that the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 was a hoax perpetrated by gun control advocates. That theory, first dismissed as outrageous and loony, took on new gravity after Mr. Jones\u2019s supporters began harassing the grieving parents of victims.Or take Pizzagate, a right-wing conspiracy theory that alleged that Hillary Clinton and other Democrats were secretly running a child-sex ring. The theory, which was spread in a variety of videos on YouTube and other platforms, might have remained an internet oddity. But it became a menace when a believer showed up at a pizza restaurant in Washington, D.C., with an assault rifle, vowing to save the children he believed were locked in the basement.To its credit, YouTube has taken some minor steps to curb misinformation. Last year, it began appending Wikipedia blurbs to videos espousing certain conspiracy theories, and changed the way it handles search results for breaking news stories so that reliable sources are given priority over opportunistic partisans. And last summer, it was among the many social networks to bar Mr. Jones and Infowars.In a multipart Twitter thread this month, Guillaume Chaslot, a former YouTube software engineer, called the company\u2019s decision to change its recommendation algorithm a \u201chistoric victory.\u201dMr. Chaslot noted that this algorithm \u2014 which was once trained to maximize the amount of time users spend on the site \u2014 often targeted vulnerable users by steering them toward other conspiracy theory videos it predicts they will watch.The change \u201cwill save thousands from falling into such rabbit holes,\u201d he wrote.In an interview last week, Mr. Chaslot was more circumspect, saying YouTube\u2019s move may have amounted to a \u201cP.R. stunt.\u201d Because the change will affect only which videos YouTube recommends \u2014 conspiracy theories will still show up in search results, and they will still be freely available to people who subscribe to the channels of popular conspiracy theorists \u2014 he called it a positive but insufficient step.\u201cIt will address only a tiny fraction of conspiracy theories,\u201d he said.Last year, Mr. Chaslot built a website, AlgoTransparency.org, to give outsiders a glimpse of YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithms at work. The site draws from a list of more than 1,000 popular YouTube channels, and calculates which videos are most often recommended to people who watch those channels\u2019 videos.On many days, conspiracy theories and viral hoaxes top the list. One recent day, the most frequently recommended video was \u201cThis Man Saw Something at Area 51 That Left Him Totally Speechless!,\u201d which was recommended to viewers of 138 channels. The second most recommended video, which linked a series of recent natural disasters to apocalyptic prophecies from the Book of Revelation, was recommended to viewers of 126 of those top channels.In our conversation, Mr. Chaslot suggested one possible solution to YouTube\u2019s misinformation epidemic: new regulation.Lawmakers, he said, could amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 the law that prevents platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter from being held legally liable for content posted by their users. The law now shields internet platforms from liability for all user-generated content they host, as well as the algorithmic recommendations they make. A revised law could cover only the content and leave platforms on the hook for their recommendations.\u201cRight now, they just don\u2019t have incentive to do the right thing,\u201d Mr. Chaslot said. \u201cBut if you pass legislation that says that after recommending something 1,000 times, the platform is liable for this content, I guarantee the problem will be solved very fast.\u201dBut even new laws governing algorithmic recommendations wouldn\u2019t reverse the influence of YouTube celebrities like Mr. Dawson. After all, many of his millions of views come from his fans, who subscribe to his channel and seek out his videos proactively.YouTube\u2019s first challenge will be defining which of these videos constitute \u201charmful\u201d misinformation, and which are innocent entertainment meant for an audience that is largely in on the joke.But there is a thornier problem here. Many young people have absorbed a YouTube-centric worldview, including rejecting mainstream information sources in favor of platform-native creators bearing \u201csecret histories\u201d and faux-authoritative explanations.When those creators propagate hoaxes and conspiracy theories as part of a financially motivated growth strategy, it seeps in with some percentage of their audience. And sometimes \u2014 in ways no algorithm could predict \u2014 it leads viewers to a much darker place.It\u2019s possible that YouTube can still beat back the flood of conspiracy theories coursing through its servers. But doing it will require acknowledging how deep these problems run and realizing that any successful effort may look less like a simple algorithm tweak, and more like deprogramming a generation."}, {"title": "Busy Is Not a Badge of Honor.

Families earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level would be able to send their children to these centers for free. Families earning more than that would be charged on a sliding scale, up to a maximum of 7 percent of their income.The plan would be funded by Ms. Warren\u2019s proposed wealth tax on households with more than $50 million in assets, her campaign said.\u201cThe guarantee is about what each of our children is entitled to,\u201d Ms. Warren said at a campaign rally in Los Angeles on Monday, announcing her plans to introduce the bill. \u201cNot just the children of the wealthy, not just the children of the well-connected, but every one of our children is entitled to good child care.\u201dMark Zandi and Sophia Koropeckyj, economists at Moody\u2019s Analytics, estimated that the plan would cost the federal government $70 billion per year more than it currently spends on child care programs, but would be fully covered by revenue from Ms. Warren\u2019s wealth tax. Their cost estimate was based on the assumption that the plan would produce economic growth by giving lower- and middle-class families more spending money, allowing parents to work longer hours, and creating more and higher-paying jobs for child care workers.\u201cThe proposal quickly lifts economic growth, as the stimulus created by providing financial support to lower-income and middle-class families more than offsets the negative fallout from increasing taxes on the very wealthy,\u201d Mr. Zandi and Ms. Koropeckyj wrote.Ms. Warren framed the issue broadly: not just as a matter of access to education, but as a means to promote economic growth and address gender inequality in the work force. Mr. Zandi and Ms. Koropeckyj wrote that the cost of child care had \u201cweighed heavily on female labor force participation,\u201d because some women who can\u2019t afford it are unable to work outside the home as a result. In a post on Medium on Tuesday, Ms. Warren repeated a personal story she has often told before: that if it hadn\u2019t been for her Aunt Bee, who helped care for her children, she would have had to quit her job as a law school instructor.Katie Hamm, vice president for early childhood policy at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think tank, said that framing was significant. \u201cIt reflects the fact that the issue has clearly grown into the public policy sphere and the economic policy sphere, where before it had been relegated to a family policy issue or an education issue,\u201d she said.The Center for American Progress is one of several organizations \u2014 also including the National Women\u2019s Law Center and the Center for Law and Social Policy \u2014 that Ms. Warren\u2019s staff consulted in developing the proposal.Ms. Hamm said the plan addressed what she identified as the three pillars of child care policy: affordability, quality and wages. Focusing on just one or two of the pillars could have unintended consequences, she said; for instance, a program that subsidized child care and set quality standards could come at the expense of a living wage for providers.Ms. Warren\u2019s plan and her language in presenting it reflect the shifting ground on which the Democratic primary is being fought. Strongly progressive economic plans, which were the exception as recently as 2016, are now the norm, and cost is not as popular an objection as it once was.\u201cWhen people say, \u2018That\u2019s going to be really expensive\u2019 \u2014 yes, it is: This will be about four times more than we have invested in our children, but that\u2019s exactly what we need to do,\u201d Ms. Warren said at her rally on Monday. \u201cI am so tired of hearing what the richest country on the face of the earth just can\u2019t afford to do.\u201d"}, {"title": "Boston\u2019s Work Force Draws Sneaker Brands.

The city is bursting with tech, education, design and creative hubs generating that talent, said Roy Hirshland, the chief executive of T3 Advisors, a real estate consulting and brokerage firm that worked with Asics on finding a Boston location.ImageAsics employs about 100 workers in its new 19,000-square-foot, open-concept design studio in Boston.CreditDaniel Tepper for The New York TimesNew Balance and Converse were founded in the Boston area, and Reebok has had a presence there for years, but since 2015, all three have opened dazzling headquarters in separate corners of the city, as they compete for the most creative shoe and apparel designers.Puma recently announced that it, too, would open a new North American headquarters, this one in Somerville, a city bordering Boston. Other shoe companies that have recently moved into new spaces just outside Boston include Rockport, in Newton, and Wolverine Worldwide, owner of Saucony, Sperry, Keds and Stride Rite, in Waltham.Asics America, part of a Japanese sporting goods conglomerate, arrived last year. It now employs about 100 workers in a 19,000-square-foot, open-concept design studio in an office tower adjacent to South Station, the city\u2019s main transit hub. As Mr. McCarthy put it, \u201cIt\u2019s better to be among the bunch that are scrapping it out.\u201d(That fierce competition among sneaker makers dealt a blow to Mr. McCarthy himself just a week later. Asics announced last Wednesday that the chief executive would be replaced by Koichiro Kodama, as the company shifts its strategy for driving growth in the brand\u2019s performance running category.)According to data provided by T3, the Boston area has the country\u2019s second-highest concentration of labor in shoe fashion design services, wholesalers and manufacturing. Greater Portland, Ore., home to Nike and Adidas, is No. 1.\u201cThe reason these businesses are clustered is talent,\u201d said Matthew Powell, a sports industry adviser for NPD Group, a market research firm. \u201cBrands tend to poach good people from other brands \u2014 we see a lot of people moving from one company to another. Work space can play a role in that.\u201dImageThe walls of the Asics design studio are shaped by stacked, three-dimensional undulating lines meant to evoke rake marks in the sand of a Zen garden.CreditDaniel Tepper for The New York TimesSome brands have chosen to broadcast their Boston presence in highly visible locations. New Balance\u2019s 250,000-square-foot world headquarters, which opened in 2015 in the Allston-Brighton section, resembles a glass cruise liner skimming alongside the Massachusetts Turnpike. The new headquarters for Converse, a Nike subsidiary formerly based in the suburb of North Andover, is in a reconfigured brick factory building overlooking the Charles River, just around the corner from the TD Garden sports arena.Asics chose a subtler presence, bringing sales, marketing and product creation staff to a single floor in an office tower on Summer Street. The only hint of the company\u2019s presence from the outside is a ceiling light fixture in the spiral shape of the Asics logo installed within view of passers-by.In a nod to the company\u2019s Japanese ownership, the office has a minimalist vibe. Walls are shaped by stacked, three-dimensional undulating lines meant to evoke rake marks in the sand of a Zen garden. Lighting is soothing in the employee break bar, which includes a living wall that reinforces the connection to nature, a concept known as biophilia.Throughout the space, employees work at shared tables spaced generously apart amid colorful sneaker displays. Teams meet in conference rooms of varying sizes, and brainstorm with dry erase paint on the white walls.Asics is teaming up with the building manager, Oxford Properties Group, to open a small gym on the ground floor with space for fitness classes. The partnership gives Asics an opportunity to brand the space, including bringing in fitness trainers who appear on the Asics Studio app, Mr. McCarthy said.Reebok made a company gym a major highlight of its new 220,000-square-foot headquarters, which opened in 2017 in the Innovation and Design Building, a massive complex that was originally a military storehouse in the Seaport District. The company\u2019s 35,000-square-foot employee fitness center stretches to two floors, and includes a boxing ring and an area dedicated to training for the fitness regimen CrossFit, a licensing partner with Reebok.\u201cWe didn\u2019t do it for altruistic reasons,\u201d said Matt O\u2019Toole, Reebok\u2019s president. \u201cWe did it because we really do think our employees are better at their jobs when they have a chance to work out during the day.\u201dThe work areas in the industrial-style space are all open, with no assigned seating and no private offices, not even for Mr. O\u2019Toole. That\u2019s been a big adjustment from the company\u2019s former suburban office campus in Canton, Mass., where cubicles were the norm. The goal is to give people the flexibility to sit alongside whomever they need to be working with at any particular moment, Mr. O\u2019Toole said.\u201cIt\u2019s an agile work environment meant to support a wide variety of work styles,\u201d said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal in the Boston office of Gensler, which designed the space. \u201cEmployees have access to focus rooms, lounge areas, huddle rooms, a cafe and touchdown spaces near the windows.\u201dAn extensive archive of older products is available to designers who want to dig through them in search of inspiration. At the old campus, such resources were \u201cburied and distant,\u201d Ms. Vogelmann said. Designers can also play around with low-tech and high-tech equipment in a maker lab.Office spaces with a variety of seating arrangements and access to workout facilities or outdoor terraces are part of a larger trend in commercial real estate, as even conventional corporations like I.B.M. and General Electric adopt more collaborative work styles. Highly designed spaces in dynamic urban settings can act as a magnet for young talent, Ms. Vogelmann said. But athletic shoe companies, she noted, also want their space to be \u201camazingly branded.\u201d\u201cThey are going after partnerships with athletes and celebrities, and they bring them in to kind of pitch them before they\u2019re contracted,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want their space to be the brand beacon.\u201dImageThe Asics design studio is in an office tower adjacent to Boston\u2019s South Station, the city\u2019s main transit hub.CreditDaniel Tepper for The New York TimesThese companies recognize that office design is \u201cthe most physical expression of your brand,\u201d Mr. Hirshland said.Puma is still selecting an architecture firm to design its North American headquarters in Somerville. Scheduled to open in 2021, the 150,000-square-foot space, expected to employ about 550 people, will be in an office building going up in Assembly Row, a development on the Mystic River with apartments, dining, shopping and its own commuter rail stop.\u201cWe are still working on how to structure a matrix for the organization that enables people to come together effortlessly,\u201d Adam Petrick, the company\u2019s global director of brand and marketing, said from his Boston office at the company\u2019s existing Congress Street location, near City Hall. Puma also has offices in Westford, and will consolidate both operations in Somerville.One problem Mr. Petrick is determined to remedy is the chronic clutter around the existing office. Boxes, sneakers and fabric samples are scattered on the floor and piled on desks. The new space should be a \u201creset\u201d for greater efficiency, he said.The space will also be \u201cinspirational\u201d in its reflection of the Puma brand, he said. The company has recently returned to wooing N.B.A. players to endorsement deals, as part of a strategy to link Puma to the broader culture that flows from basketball, including fashion and music.\u201cWe want to embody sports and sports culture,\u201d Mr. Petrick said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to reground in sports, but we still love that fashion edge.\u201d"}, {"title": "Post-Gazette Appoints Writer of \u2018Reason as Racism\u2019 Editorial as Its Newsroom Leader", "category": "Business", "id": "d7d0b942-0c1a-405a-a679-43c6228dd2f7", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/business/media/pittsburgh-post-gazette-executive-editor.html", "publishdate": 20190219, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/business/20PITTSBURGH-01/merlin_150692688_53296430-1513-4c38-b0a9-392df5e74dd5-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 Last year, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette chose Martin Luther King\u2019s Birthday as the publication date for an editorial headlined \u201cReason as Racism.\u201d On Monday, a little more than a year after that piece drew national criticism, The Post-Gazette named its editorial page director, Keith C. Burris, as its newsroom leader.Mr. Burris was appointed executive editor at a stormy time at the Pittsburgh daily.Relations between its workers\u2019 union, the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh, and the paper\u2019s owner, Block Communications, have been tense. Things came to a head on the night of Feb. 9, when John R. Block, the publisher, subjected staff members to a tirade in the newsroom. According to several journalists who were present, Mr. Block threatened employees\u2019 jobs as his young daughter, whom he had brought with him, sobbed and begged him to stop. Block Communications has disputed the journalists\u2019 version of events.Mr. Burris, who wrote the \u201cReason as Racism\u201d editorial, according to Mr. Block, was in charge of the editorial pages at The Post-Gazette and its sibling paper, The Toledo Blade in Ohio, at the time of his appointment. He will continue to serve as editorial page editor of both publications even as he assumes the new role.In an email to employees on Monday, Mr. Burris asked for the support of the staff.\u201cI ask you to recognize my pledge and I beseech you to work with me \u2014 WORK WITH ME \u2014 to uphold the hallowed legacy of The Post-Gazette and to march forward into a future worthy of its past,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt will not be easy. These are perilous times for journalism, in so many ways, and we owe the Block family a tremendous debt for sustaining us and believing in our mission.\u201dThe \u201cReason as Racism\u201d editorial drew backlash from the local community, former and current newsroom employees and even members of the Block family.\u201cWe do not condone the sentiments expressed in the piece,\u201d members of the Block family wrote in a letter to The Post-Gazette editor published three days after the editorial ran. \u201cWe do not condone the whitewashing of racism, nor the normalization of it. We cannot remain silent and by implication approve of the use of The Post-Gazette to provide cover for racism.\u201dMr. Burris also had a hand in the firing of a longtime editorial cartoonist, Rob Rogers, in June, after Mr. Rogers complained that his cartoons critical of President Trump had been censored.The appointment of Mr. Burris was effective \u201cimmediately,\u201d according to a notice posted in the newsroom on Monday. He replaced David Shribman, who retired as executive editor at the end of 2018 after a 15-year run. Mr. Shribman, a Pulitzer Prize winner, earned plaudits last year for The Post-Gazette\u2019s coverage of the massacre at the Tree of Life Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood. For the edition published the day after the attack, he wrote a front-page headline in Hebrew quoting the first words of the Jewish mourner\u2019s prayer.The new top editor faces the challenge of uniting a divided newsroom. After Mr. Block\u2019s recent tirade, the guild has filed a formal grievance against the publisher and asked that he be barred from The Post-Gazette building.Michael A. Fuoco, president of the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh, said the union had no comment on the appointment of Mr. Burris. \u201cHowever,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have our previous reaction to his racist editorial and the firing of Rob Rogers.\u201d In both instances, the guild voiced its strong opposition.Nolan Rosenkrans, president of the Newspaper Guild of Toledo, said that Mr. Burris\u2019s appointment was the latest move in an attempt by Block Communications to consolidate its executive positions.According to the notice of Mr. Burris\u2019s expanded role, he will work closely with Kurt Franck, who serves as The Blade\u2019s executive vice president, executive editor, president and general manager.Mr. Burris and a spokesman for Block Communications did not respond to several requests for comment."}, {"title": "Recent Commercial Real Estate Transactions", "category": "Business", "id": "cd3ed4cd-93b0-4fa0-8ec0-f9d862c6e8f7", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/realestate/commercial/new-york-commercial-real-estate.html", "publishdate": 20190219, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/realestate/commercial/20trans-For-Lease/20trans-For-Lease--articleLarge.jpg", "content": "FOR LEASE$280.82/SQ.

Mr. Ren and the firm had previously declined to say much on the case, citing respect for the legal process. But he appears to be sharpening his language as a hearing nears on whether his daughter should be sent to the United States to stand trial.\u201cI object to what the U.S. has done,\u201d Mr. Ren told the BBC. \u201cThis kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable.\u201dLate last month, the Justice Department unveiled sweeping charges against Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, outlining yearslong efforts by the Chinese firm to steal American industrial secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade economic sanctions against Iran. Ms. Meng, who is Mr. Ren\u2019s elder daughter, was arrested in December by Canadian authorities acting at the request of the United States. She remains in Canada while awaiting a decision by its legal authorities about whether she will be extradited to the United States to face charges.The criminal case against Huawei and Ms. Meng coincides with a campaign by American officials to pressure Western governments not to use Huawei\u2019s equipment in their mobile networks. Washington has long held that the company\u2019s networking gear could be used to help Beijing spy on Americans, charges that Huawei has consistently denied. Relations between China and the United States have already been tense as efforts to resolve their monthslong trade war plod forward.Mr. Ren, 74, has generally preferred to avoid the spotlight as he built Huawei into the world\u2019s largest supplier of the equipment that enables modern telecommunications.In an interview last month with a group of journalists from international news outlets, Mr. Ren said: \u201cI trust that the legal systems of Canada and the United States are open, just and fair, and will reach a just conclusion. We will make our judgment after all the evidence is made public.\u201d Mr. Ren\u2019s latest comments appear to be aimed at a Canadian audience. A Canadian judge is set in the coming weeks to hear arguments about whether Ms. Meng should be extradited.One issue that is likely to factor into the Canadian authorities\u2019 decision is whether her arrest was politically motivated. Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, has warned the United States not to use the extradition process to pursue political ends. And last month, John McCallum, Canada\u2019s ambassador to China at the time, said Ms. Meng had a good chance of avoiding extradition because of remarks by President Trump, who had said he was willing to intervene if it would help secure a trade deal.Mr. McCallum backpedaled on his observation. But he was pushed out of his job soon after."}, {"title": "On Politics: Bernie Sanders Announces 2020 Bid", "category": "Politics", "id": "67ae0a40-e141-44d1-b16a-c65c8f58a85d", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/on-politics-bernie-sanders-announces-2020-bid.html", "publishdate": 20190219, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Tuesday morning.

No more would it rely on established Hollywood partners to push its films into theaters. But the box office game is harder than it looks, and Amazon released six flops in a row. Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cWonder Wheel\u201d cost $25 million to make and took in only $1.4 million in North America. \u201cBeautiful Boy,\u201d based on the best-selling book, cost $23 million and collected $7.6 million.Now a company that is accustomed to entering markets and making the incumbents shudder is pushing the reset button.\u201cWhat we struggled with, I think, was putting too much focus on a narrow prestige lane,\u201d said Jennifer Salke, who took over as the head of Amazon Studios last March after successful stints at NBC and 20th Century Fox Television. \u201cI don\u2019t think we had diverse-enough points of view in the storytelling.\u201dTo that end, Ms. Salke said she had decided that the way forward for Amazon involves different \u201clanes.\u201d Those include awards-worthy specialty films, including five she bought at the recent Sundance Film Festival, a couple for eye-popping prices; sexual thrillers like \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d (1992) or \u201cBody Heat\u201d (1981), a genre that most studios have abandoned; and films from Blumhouse, the horror studio behind hits like \u201cThe Purge.\u201d Ms. Salke also wants to add a pipeline of young-adult films.Mr. Allen is notably absent from her strategy. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any plans to release any Woody Allen movies,\u201d she said, declining to comment further on the filmmaker, who is suing Amazon for backing out of a four-movie deal because of a renewed focus on allegations of sexual abuse against him.Amazon is now striving, at least to start, to roll out about 30 original movies a year. Budgets will range from a few million dollars up to $50 million or more. But not all of those movies will be released in theaters. For instance, the \u201csexy date-night movies,\u201d to use Ms. Salke\u2019s description, will go directly to Prime Video, Amazon\u2019s streaming service. (Look for them on Saturday nights starting this summer.) The scary Blumhouse movies \u2014 eight have been ordered \u2014 will also skip theaters.\u201cSome will be thriller-y, some will have a foot in horror, some will be more serious drama,\u201d said Jeremy Gold, who runs Blumhouse TV with Marci Wiseman. \u201cWe see this as a critical next step in building an ongoing relationship between Amazon and Blumhouse.\u201dAmazon emphasized that it would continue to give about 10 movies a year exclusive runs in theaters. Coming up: \u201cThe Aeronauts,\u201d starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones as hot air balloon adventurers, and \u201cLate Night,\u201d a comedy starring Emma Thompson as a late-night talk-show host who hires her only female staff writer, played by Mindy Kaling.ImageAmazon\u2019s most recent film release, \u201cCold War,\u201d a foreign-language romance, received three Oscar nominations.CreditAmazon StudiosEven so, Amazon may start to shorten the period of exclusivity given to theater owners for some films so it can bring them to Prime Video more quickly.\u201cIt\u2019s really about creating that right marketing campaign, right distribution plan for each movie, allowing us to break through the cultural noise and really resonating with customers,\u201d said Matt Newman, one of three executives Ms. Salke has named as film co-chiefs. The others are Julie Rapaport, who will focus on wide-appeal movies, and Ted Hope, who has overseen Amazon\u2019s art films since 2015.That stance could frustrate multiplex chains, which insist on a 90-day period of exclusivity, worrying that moviegoers will be reluctant to buy tickets if they know they can catch the same film just a few weeks later in their living rooms. AMC and Regal, for instance, have refused to show Netflix\u2019s \u201cRoma\u201d because Netflix offered only 21 days of exclusivity.Amazon\u2019s first foray into the movie business was Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cChi-Raq,\u201d a 2015 comedic drama that received strong reviews but did not sell many tickets. Amazon teamed with an established film company, Roadside Attractions, to release it. Amazon and Roadside reteamed the next year and found an art-house hit in the bleak drama \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d which took in $48 million in North America and received six Oscar nominations, winning two, including best actor for Casey Affleck. \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d a comedy released in 2017 in partnership with Lionsgate, collected about $43 million and received an Academy Award nomination for its screenplay.Not bad for a newbie.But Amazon\u2019s track record soured as it pushed toward self-distribution. Its first effort was \u201cWonder Wheel,\u201d which was undoubtedly hurt by renewed scrutiny of allegations that Mr. Allen molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992. Mr. Allen has steadfastly denied the claims and was not charged. Amazon also financed Mr. Allen\u2019s next film, \u201cA Rainy Day in New York,\u201d but has refused to release it, prompting Mr. Allen to sue.Amazon\u2019s movie operation has recently shown signs of life. Sitting in her office at the historic Culver Studios, which serves as Amazon\u2019s entertainment headquarters, Ms. Salke noted that the company\u2019s most recent film release, \u201cCold War,\u201d a foreign-language romance, received three Oscar nominations. \u201cCold War\u201d has sold $3.6 million in tickets, a decent total for a foreign film. \u201cWe really think it\u2019ll also do well when it reaches Prime Video,\u201d Ms. Salke said.When Ms. Salke arrived at Amazon, her first priority was performing triage on the company\u2019s television business. \u201cTransparent,\u201d the studio\u2019s marquee hit at the time, was in disarray because of the departure of its star, Jeffrey Tambor, who was fired after a sexual-harassment investigation. (He maintained his innocence.) Ms. Salke had inherited another hit, \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d from her predecessor, Roy Price, who was ousted after a sexual harassment scandal of his own. But she needed to quickly jump-start the rest of Amazon\u2019s television business to catch up to a fast-moving Netflix, an insurgent Apple and a Disney-powered Hulu.With Amazon\u2019s television assembly line in much better shape \u2014 Ms. Salke has made deals with creators like Jordan Peele to bring shows to the service \u2014 she is now looking more intently at the studio\u2019s film operation.\u201cIt\u2019s not about volume and endless scroll,\u201d she said, in a clear reference to Netflix, which unfurls roughly 90 original movies annually, including documentaries. \u201cThe curated approach is the only way to go for us. Quality over quantity.\u201d"}, {"title": "Huawei Risks to Britain Can Be Blunted, U.K. Official Says, in a Rebuff to U.S.", "category": "Business", "id": "a94c0d5f-44c6-43a5-b999-a9ff62a37f14", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/business/huawei-uk-trump.html", "publishdate": 20190220, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/21/business/21HUAWEI1/merlin_150847260_47be6f04-a1f6-4505-bd3a-19a2b536340a-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LONDON \u2014 The Trump administration has spent a year trying to convince America\u2019s allies in Europe that the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei is a grave threat to their national security and should not be allowed any role in developing new wireless networks.A top British official indicated Wednesday that the aggressive campaign may not be working.The official, Ciaran Martin, who leads Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Center, expressed confidence at a conference in Brussels that any security risks Huawei posed could be managed.Britain, Mr. Martin noted, has successfully managed the company\u2019s presence in the country\u2019s telecommunications networks for more than 15 years by subjecting its products to strict security reviews at a laboratory run by government intelligence officials, and would continue to do so.\u201cOur regime is arguably the toughest and most rigorous oversight regime in the world for Huawei,\u201d he said. He added that the company\u2019s equipment \u201cis not in any sensitive networks, including those of the government.\u201d\u201cIts kit is part of a balanced supply chain with other suppliers,\u201d Mr. Martin said.As Britain\u2019s cellphone carriers begin to build 5G networks, officials are considering if, and how, Huawei fits into the effort. With a final decision expected by the end of the year, Mr. Martin\u2019s remarks suggest the British government is unmoved by the Trump administration\u2019s offensive against the company.Because Britain belongs to the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance with the United States, whatever it decides on Huawei is likely to affect how other countries treat the company. Germany is also considering allowing Huawei in parts of its network, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.Europe has become a key battleground in the debate over Huawei. While the company has mostly been blocked in the United States, it is well established in Europe, working closely with carriers like Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and BT Group. The region is Huawei\u2019s second-largest market after China.ImageA top British cybersecurity official said Britain had been managing Huawei\u2019s activities in its telecommunications networks by subjecting its products to strict security reviews.CreditAndy Wong/Associated PressIf Britain does not ban Huawei, it would be a defeat for the White House. In private intelligence briefings and public speeches, American officials have warned that Huawei is beholden to the Chinese government, and that countries allowing its equipment to be installed as part of 5G networks will open themselves up to espionage.Vice President Mike Pence, in a speech last week at an international security conference in Munich, took a direct swipe at Huawei, warning America\u2019s allies \u201cto be vigilant and to reject any enterprise that would compromise the integrity of our communications technology or national security systems.\u201dAdministration officials have also said that decisions about where the United States puts military bases and troops could be affected by whether countries\u2019 networks have such equipment.On Thursday, President Trump posted on Twitter that American companies needed to step up the deployment 5G technology or risk falling behind other countries.[What is 5G? Here\u2019s what you need to know about the next-generation network.]Huawei has forcefully denied accusations that it is an instrument of the Chinese government. The company is the world\u2019s largest maker of telecommunications equipment \u2014 selling antennas, base stations and other products used by the operators of the world\u2019s largest wireless networks.The 5G networks are considered critical to the global economy, providing not just hyper-fast internet speeds, but also new capabilities for sensors, robots, autonomous vehicles, and other data-hungry devices and services. In Europe alone, mobile operators are expected to invest at least $340 billion to develop the networks, according to the wireless trade body GSMA.Huawei\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei, whose daughter, Meng Wanzhou, also a top company executive, was arrested in December by the Canadian authorities at the request of the United States, denounced America\u2019s campaign in an interview with BBC this week. He called the actions \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d and vowed that there was \u201cno way the U.S. can crush\u201d the company.In Britain, one of Huawei\u2019s most important markets, the government\u2019s treatment of the company has long been debated. A report published on Wednesday by the Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank, said that \u201callowing Huawei\u2019s participation is at best na\u00efve, at worst irresponsible.\u201dImageRichard Yu, chief executive of the Huawei Consumer Business Group, showing the company\u2019s 5G chip Balong 5G01 before the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, last year.CreditAlbert Gea/ReutersThe British strategy for dealing with Huawei has traditionally involved containment. The country operates a research lab outside London to review Huawei\u2019s products and code, and publishes an annual review of the company\u2019s technology. Last year, Britain criticized Huawei for engineering and supply-chain flaws.\u201cWe will monitor and report on progress, and we will not declare the problems are on the path to being solved unless and until there is clear evidence that this is the case,\u201d Mr. Martin said in his remarks on Wednesday. \u201cWe will not compromise on the improvements we need to see from Huawei.\u201dAmerican officials have argued that 5G networks are much more complex than existing systems, and that the many lines of constantly updating code make the systems nearly impossible to protect entirely.Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund specializing in trans-Atlantic policy, said that a determination by British officials that Huawei could be handled as a manageable risk would undercut the argument that the company posed an existential risk.\u201cThey\u2019ve made a pretty hardheaded evaluation that the United States was exaggerating the extent of the problem,\u201d said Mr. Chase, a former American diplomat to London. \u201cI don\u2019t think they did that to please the Chinese.\u201dIn his speech in Brussels, Mr. Martin said cybersecurity risks were not confined to one company.\u201cThe supply chain, and where suppliers are from, is one issue, but it is not the only issue,\u201d he said. Last year, he added, his organization \u201cpublicly attributed some attacks on U.K. networks, including telecoms networks, to Russia.\u201d\u201cAs far as we know, those networks didn\u2019t have any Russian kit in them, anywhere,\u201d he said.The dispute over what risk the company presents has complicated Britain\u2019s efforts to avoid becoming entangled in the trade war between the United States and China. As it prepares to exit the European Union, Britain is seeking new trade deals with both Washington and Beijing.China is a small but growing trade partner with Britain. Businesses exported a record 22.3 billion pounds, about $28.8 billion, worth of goods to China in 2017, making it Britain\u2019s sixth-largest trading partner. The United States is the largest, accounting for \u00a3112.2 billion worth of exports in 2017, according to a report from Parliament this month."}, {"title": "How an App Creates \u2018Disturbingly Agile Millennial Thumbs\u2019", "category": "Business", "id": "46e0072a-5c69-42a0-893a-250ed4dabfa0", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/technology/personaltech/agile-millennial-thumbs.html", "publishdate": 20190220, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/21/business/21techusing5/merlin_150941661_abaf69cd-5205-4955-acb3-76533a3614a8-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives?

We don\u2019t have desk phones in our bureau and everyone bounces around, so it pays to be as mobile as possible. I have Slack, Google Hangouts and the Google Docs app downloaded on my phone. I\u2019ll also take pictures and videos to remind me of scenes when I\u2019m reporting a feature. I\u2019ll use Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to both share our bureau\u2019s stories and find potential ones. It looks like Apple doesn\u2019t even sell the iPhone 6S anymore. They want us to upgrade. But it\u2019s been only a few years, so I refuse.I still keep a notebook on hand that I\u2019ll occasionally use. But to be honest, I have atrocious handwriting, and deciphering it is arduous. Instead, I use the Notes app. I find it easier to write up thoughts and notes that way \u2014 though once, it did freak out a source, who asked me how I was able to type and look her in the eye. (Disturbingly agile millennial thumbs is how.)For reporting in the field, I had a Sony ICD-PX470 voice recorder with a built-in USB that was the slimmest, most unobtrusive device \u2014 until I dropped it on a recent assignment. I\u2019m using the Voice Memos app for now until I can pick up a new one. The TapeACall app works for recording phone interviews.

Please never stop making music.Australia has a reputation for trying to limit transparency. And are there tech tools you\u2019ve found that help to improve transparency?The lack of transparency is more of a general suspicion from officials and people in the corporate sector about journalists. Questions for government officials or corporate executives are heavily filtered through publicists and communications people. It\u2019s harder to get someone in a powerful position on the phone. Certain applications, statistics or reports are surprisingly difficult to find.It just means having more conversations with different sources to try to get information. One handy trick I did learn is that you can click on the arrow next to a search engine result. It pulls up the previously published versions of the site, even if the current version of a website is down.What tech do Australians love?As long as it\u2019s available here, we love many of the same apps and gadgets Americans do.One thing that doesn\u2019t exist here is Venmo, the peer-to-peer payments app, which I used to miss.

Every new person I meet asks to add me on Instagram now.Amazon only recently arrived in Australia. Are Australians embracing it? When I lived in the United States, Amazon Prime was practically a way of life. But it hasn\u2019t quite taken off here in the same way. For me, it\u2019s because the selection of products was limited until November, and shipping here has been slow and unreliable, so it hasn\u2019t quite distinguished itself from Australian retailers. I\u2019ll still order the occasional clothing and electronics item online \u2014 but for everything else, I\u2019ll go in person to browse the stores.

If there\u2019s one area Amazon is raking in my cash, it\u2019s e-books.Outside of work, what tech are you obsessed with, and why?For personal budgeting, I\u2019d really recommend the You Need a Budget app, which has a mysterious way of making saving money seem like a game. Headspace, a meditation and mindfulness app, helps me wind down.

It was the second unexpected departure of a high-level Tesla executive in less than a month and one of dozens in the last three years.The general counsel, Dane Butswinkas, was a prominent Washington trial lawyer who represented the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, when he was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission last year over claims that he had secured funding to take the company private. Tesla said Mr. Butswinkas had decided to return to his law firm and would be replaced by Jonathan Chang, a vice president in its legal department.Three weeks earlier, on Jan. 30, Mr. Musk surprised analysts on a conference call by announcing that Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, Deepak Ahuja, would retire without saying exactly when. Last year, Tesla\u2019s chief accounting officer, David Morton, stepped down after just a month on the job. Mr. Morton\u2019s predecessor, Eric Branderiz, left after 14 months. All told, Tesla has lost more than 40 senior executives since the beginning of 2016, according to a list compiled by Reuters.Mr. Butswinkas\u2019s departure was all the more noteworthy because it came less than 24 hours after Mr. Musk made an ambitious prediction on Twitter about the company\u2019s production goals, an action that raised questions about his compliance with the settlement that he and Tesla reached with the S.E.C.Mr. Musk said that he expected the company to produce 500,000 cars this year \u2014 100,000 more than he had forecast just three weeks earlier. Four hours later, Mr. Musk said he had misspoken.In the settlement with the S.E.C., he and Tesla had agreed that it would put in place \u201cmandatory procedures to oversee and preapprove Mr. Musk\u2019s Tesla-related written communications\u201d that might have material information. A Tesla spokesman declined to comment on what scrutiny had been given to Mr. Musk\u2019s incorrect Tuesday statement before it was posted.The S.E.C.\u2019s securities fraud case stemmed from a Twitter post in August in which Mr. Musk said he planned to take the company private at $420 a share and had \u201cfunding secured.\u201d In addition to the condition about reviewing his statements, Mr. Musk agreed to step down as chairman; he and the company each paid penalties of $20 million; and the company added two new independent directors.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that the general counsel is leaving after a tweet that appears to violate the agreement,\u201d said Rebecca Lindland, executive editor of RebeccaDrives.com, an auto-industry and car review website. \u201cIt calls into question the oversight of the board and the adherence to the S.E.C. settlement.\u201dThe S.E.C. and the Justice Department have been looking into whether Mr. Musk misled investors about its production goals. Mr. Musk had once predicted that Tesla would make 500,000 cars in 2018. The company actually made about 245,000 cars last year.Tesla said in a securities filing on Tuesday that it \u201cwill continue to cooperate with government authorities.\u201dThe stream of executive departures is one of several challenges for Tesla. It is scrambling to secure financing to build a plant in China, one that Mr. Musk has vowed would begin churning out cars by the end of this year. Sales of its two most profitable models, the Model S luxury sedan and the Model X sport utility vehicle, are flat. And it is still unable to produce a $35,000 version of the Model 3 sedan, which many customers are holding out for.Next month, Tesla has to pay bondholders $920 million, which would consume about a quarter of the $3.7 billion it had in cash at the end of December.The company\u2019s stock closed down 1 percent on Wednesday.Tesla\u2019s sales appear to have dropped off markedly since the beginning of the year, when a federal tax credit available to Tesla customers was cut in half, to $3,750. An online publication that follows Tesla closely, InsideEVs, has estimated that the company sold 6,500 cars in January, a 75 percent drop from the final months of 2018, when buyers could still take advantage of the full tax credit.Tesla has declined to comment on the estimate, but customer traffic appears to have dropped off significantly at its showrooms. On Saturday afternoon, a saleswoman at a company store in Warrendale, Pa., near Pittsburgh, showed a customer a Model 3 while six other employees stood idly by. While more than 50 Teslas were parked in the back, just two cars were parked in spots reserved for prospective buyers.In addition, as production and sales have increased, so have complaints about quality and customer service. Many customers have had to wait months to have their cars repaired because of shortages of replacement parts."}, {"title": "Bernie Sanders Raises $6 Million After Announcing Presidential Bid", "category": "Politics", "id": "23ff12d0-b16a-43e3-aa7b-414cb5132a5a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/us/politics/bernie-sanders-fundraising.html", "publishdate": 20190220, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/21/us/politics/21campfin/21campfin-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Just over 24 hours after announcing his presidential bid, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has already raised $6 million from more than 225,000 donors, his campaign said Wednesday morning.That amount far surpasses what any of his rivals have disclosed raising after their own announcements this year.Previously, Senator Kamala Harris of California had claimed the biggest early fund-raising haul that had been made public, with $1.5 million in 24 hours. In comparison, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign said its fund-raising in the first 24 hours came to $5.9 million.Later Wednesday, President Trump\u2019s campaign cited Mr. Sanders\u2019s windfall in its own fund-raising pitch, sending a text message to supporters telling them about the $6 million that \u201cSocialist Bernie\u201d had raised. \u201cNow I\u2019m calling on you to CRUSH that number,\u201d the message said.Mr. Sanders\u2019s early fund-raising success is not unexpected: After all, he raised well over $200 million when he ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in the 2016 election, and his list of online donors dwarfs those of his Democratic rivals.[Where does Bernie Sanders stand on key issues? Here\u2019s a refresher.]But in a crowded presidential field, where candidates are eager to demonstrate the enthusiasm behind their campaigns, early fund-raising hauls offer bragging rights, at least for a moment.A recent New York Times analysis found that Mr. Sanders began his 2020 candidacy with about 2.1 million online donors who had given him money over the last six years, an enormous lead among proven contributors that is roughly equivalent to the donor base of all the other Democratic hopefuls combined.Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman who ran unsuccessfully for Senate last year, has twice as many online donors as anyone running or considering running besides Mr. Sanders. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Ms. Harris each had drawn money from at least 230,000 online donors ahead of their candidacies.A more complete view of the candidates\u2019 fund-raising will eventually be available through the Federal Election Commission. Several well-known Democratic candidates have not released early fund-raising totals, including Ms. Warren, Ms. Gillibrand and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.Still, based on what has been made public so far, here is a guide to who can claim those bragging rights.VideoSenator Bernie Sanders is embarking on a second run for president. This time the field will be bigger, more diverse and filled with candidates who have adopted his progressive populist mantle.CreditCreditSam Hodgson for The New York TimesMr. Sanders: $6 million in just over 24 hoursMr. Sanders surpassed not only his rivals, but also his own performance when he announced his 2016 candidacy.At the time, his campaign said it collected more than $1.5 million online from 35,000 donors in the first 24 hours.While Mr. Sanders can boast of his early fund-raising success, the donor list he developed in the 2016 campaign is an enormous advantage that none of the other declared Democratic candidates can match.The Sanders campaign said on Wednesday that its average donation mirrored the $27 average from the 2016 campaign.Mr. Sanders received $600,000 in donations that will recur monthly, his campaign said.Ms. Harris: $1.5 million in 24 hoursBefore Mr. Sanders released his numbers, Ms. Harris had the most impressive fund-raising performance known in the primary so far.Her campaign said it raised $1.5 million online from more than 38,000 donors in the 24 hours after she announced her candidacy in January.The average online donation was $37, her campaign said.Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota: $1 million in 48 hoursThis is where the comparisons start to get a little tricky.Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s campaign said it raised over $1 million \u201cfrom online and grass-roots supporters\u201d in the first 48 hours of her presidential bid.But the campaign did not say how many people had donated during that period, so it is not possible to estimate the size of her average donation.Ms. Warren: $300,000 in under 24 hoursMs. Warren announced an exploratory committee for president on Dec. 31. That day, she raised about $300,000 from just over 8,000 donations through the online donation-processing platform ActBlue, according to Federal Election Commission records.Those numbers work out to an average contribution of about $37.

Most are already zippy and equipped with jumbo screens, powerful cameras and face scanners. So what else can we look forward to?It turns out, plenty. For a peek at the future of the phone, look to Samsung, the world\u2019s largest handset maker. On Wednesday, the South Korean company showed off a family of four new Galaxy phones that incorporate new technologies and features that may start spreading to other smartphones.Of the four new devices, one will work on next-generation ultrafast 5G cellular networks, which means it can download a movie in seconds rather than minutes. Three of the models will have slightly larger screens and more complex camera systems than their predecessors. And Samsung is also teasing a fifth device that can be folded and unfolded like a book to decrease or increase the phone\u2019s screen size to suit its owner. It is expected to be available in the United States on April 26 and in Europe on May 3. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here. Here\u2019s what you need to know about what\u2019s coming with screen sizes, cameras, 5G and the elusive foldable phone.Phone screens keep getting bigger. Why would I want this, and won\u2019t this add volume to my pocket?Many phone makers, including Samsung, Apple and Google, have focused on making screens larger without adding bulk to their bodies. To do this, they stretched the screens from one edge to another while shrinking the bezels, or the borders surrounding the screen.Samsung is continuing this trend. Its new Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus phones have 6.1-inch and 6.4-inch displays, up from the 5.8-inch and 6.2-inch screens on last year\u2019s Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. Even though the screens are bigger, Samsung said, the devices\u2019 body sizes are more compact than their predecessors.The company also unveiled the Galaxy S10 5G, its first phone to work with 5G networks, which will have a jumbo 6.7-inch screen. In addition, it showed the Galaxy S10E, a model with a 5.8-inch display in a body that is smaller than the S9\u2019s, for people who prefer more compact devices.ImageThe Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.CreditSamsungWhy would you want a bigger screen? When upgrading devices, people are increasingly gravitating toward phones with larger displays. Many feel that they are getting more bang for the buck with bigger screens, as studies have shown that people spend more time using apps, watching videos and browsing the web on big-screen phones.Why would I want a foldable phone?Samsung first showed a prototype of its foldable phone at a conference for software developers last year. When folded up, it looked like a phone with a small screen, and once unfolded, the screen doubled in size. At a media event on Wednesday, Samsung shared some details about its foldable device, Galaxy Fold. It has two screens \u2014 a smaller one and a larger one \u2014 with a hinge in the middle containing multiple interlocking gears. When folded up, the viewable screen measures 4.6 inches. Unfolding the device reveals its 7.3-inch display, which is the size of a tablet screen.Samsung said it was working with Google, YouTube and others to develop apps that seamlessly transition between a single screen when folded up and the double screens in unfolded mode.You may want a foldable phone if you love tablet computers. Plenty of people enjoy using tablets like Apple\u2019s iPad and Amazon\u2019s Fire Tablet for their roomy screens that are upward of seven inches diagonally. That makes watching videos, reading books and playing games more enjoyable. The downside is that tablets are so large that they aren\u2019t pocketable. A foldable phone, in theory, will let people have a tablet that can be folded up and carried in a pocket.Other phone makers are expected to jump on this trend. Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, posted an image on Twitter this month teasing a foldable phone that will be unveiled at Mobile World Congress, the tech trade show in Barcelona, next week.Foldable phones raise plenty of questions. When folded, the device becomes thicker in the pocket, which might make it bulky and uncomfortable. And it\u2019s unclear whether making the displays bendable also makes them more fragile when dropped. Smartphones already have many cameras. Why would I need more?Many newer smartphones include multiple camera lenses that let you produce different camera effects. For example, last year\u2019s iPhone XS included a rear camera with dual lenses; the two lenses worked together to blur the background while sharpening a subject in the foreground, producing what\u2019s known as the bokeh effect.ImageCreditSamsungSamsung\u2019s new Galaxy S10 and S10 Plus take this up another notch. Both include a triple camera system arranged horizontally on the back of the phone. The left lens is for zooming, the middle lens contains the main camera, and the right lens features a brand-new ultrawide angle lens for capturing broader shots, like landscapes or a big group gathering at Thanksgiving dinner.What\u2019s more, the Galaxy S10 5G will have a fourth camera for depth-sensing, which will enable richer augmented-reality applications that use data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through the smartphone lens.Expect other companies to keep beefing up the number of cameras this year. Apple also plans to add another camera to some of its next iPhones, according to a person briefed on the company\u2019s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Apple declined to comment.What\u2019s the big deal about 5G?Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy S10 5G will be one of the first phones to work with 5G wireless networks, which are a successor to current 4G networks. These new networks will introduce internet speeds so fast that devices will be able to download high-quality videos in a few seconds.But contain your excitement for now. The carriers are still far from deploying a broad 5G network. AT&T said it should have 5G deployed in 21 cities in the first half of this year. Verizon Wireless just did its first 5G data test on a smartphone late last year. There isn\u2019t expected to be much traction for the new cellular technology until 2020.And even when 5G does reach your hometown, there may be confusion about it. In a controversial move, AT&T said that it planned to give different flavors of 5G different names: 5G+ will be the fastest speed taking advantage of brand-new infrastructure, and 5GE will essentially be a faster version of 4G using upgraded 4G equipment.Gordon Mansfield, an AT&T executive, said the labels would be helpful indicators for people with 5G phones. The 5GE icon on a phone screen will inform them they have speeds that are faster than the current 4G networks, and the 5G+ indicator will mean they are getting the fastest speeds possible, he said.Also unclear is how much it will cost for people to buy 5G access \u2014 and whether the tremendous speeds will encourage consumers to burn through their cellular data faster than they did with slower technologies. The carriers have yet to announce pricing for data plans using 5G.[What is 5G? Here\u2019s what you need to know about the new network.]Phones have become costly, in some cases exceeding $1,000. Can we expect prices to continue climbing?Yes, in the high-end phone market, where Samsung and Apple compete. The Galaxy Fold, which arrives in stores late April, will cost $1,980.Samsung has not announced pricing of the Galaxy S10 5G, though the device is expected to top $1,000, in part because of its 5G compatibility and depth-sensing camera lens.For Samsung\u2019s phones with more incremental changes, prices are also up.Prices start at $750 for the Galaxy S10E, $900 for the S10 and $1,000 for the S10 Plus. Compare that with the S9 and S9 Plus, which started at $720 and $840.Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, said she was doubtful that prices could go up much more in the near-term. The $749 iPhone XR, which despite rave reviews has not sold as robustly as some had anticipated, demonstrated that consumers may have hit a threshold.\u201cWe\u2019re getting to a point where people will say, you know what, the technology is enough for me \u2014 I might want a different phone, but I don\u2019t want more,\u201d she said."}, {"title": "On Health Care, 2020 Democrats Find Their First Real Fault Lines", "category": "Politics", "id": "338f7b9c-0ae5-47b7-8031-af1b912263cd", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/us/politics/bernie-sanders-socialism-democrats.html", "publishdate": 20190220, "imageurl": "", "content": "The debate unfolded over a period of days, on multiple televised stages in different states. There were no direct clashes between the candidates, no traces of personal animus \u2014 but a debate it was, the first vivid disputation over policy in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.The subject, perhaps predictably, was health care. At issue was just how drastically to transform the American system, and how comprehensive the role of government should be.In one camp were a pair of blunt-speaking Midwesterners, Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sherrod Brown of Ohio \u2014 both beloved by many liberals, yet both dismissive of fellow Democrats\u2019 promises to create a vast new apparatus of government-backed health care. They endorsed incremental policy changes, like lowering the age of eligibility for Medicare.\u201cIt could be a possibility in the future,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said of single-payer health care, in a CNN town hall on Monday night. \u201cI\u2019m just looking at something that will work now.\u201dOn the other side was the party\u2019s most uncompromising economic populist, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a self-described democratic socialist who promised nothing short of a revolution in health care with his proposal for \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d He held up Canada and Western Europe as working models for the United States.\u201cIf our friends in Scandinavia can provide quality health care to all of their people as a right, for far less than we spend, you tell me why we can\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a CBS interview, broadcast on Tuesday morning after he declared his candidacy for president.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]The political and policy fault lines were familiar ones, but the scale and clarity of the disagreement was new to the 2020 presidential primary, an affair that has thus far unfolded as a contest of splashy campaign rollouts, forceful personalities and overlapping policy wish lists. While the party\u2019s most prominent candidates have differed in their rhetoric and most distinctive legislative proposals \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax, or Senator Kamala Harris\u2019s middle-class tax cut \u2014 at this early stage they have declined to engage the submerged philosophical rifts between them.Yet the exchanges over health care hinted that those ideological divisions may not stay buried for long: As the Democratic primary field develops and grows, the party is headed for a fuller public conversation about the role of government and the scale of their own ambitions.There have been tentative skirmishes: Ms. Warren and Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor, publicly diverged over the idea of a tax on the country\u2019s largest fortunes. Even before Mr. Sanders entered the race, other candidates drew unsubtle lines separating themselves from his brand of politics: Ms. Warren has branded herself a proud capitalist, and Ms. Harris said emphatically on Monday, \u201cI am not a democratic socialist.\u201dImageSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is staking her early campaign, in part, on voters appreciating her candor in rejecting liberal wish-list policies.CreditTim Gruber for The New York TimesBut the debate over health care may be unique in its potency. It mirrors a larger struggle among Democrats over how daring their message ought to be, and whether promising to rapidly expand social-welfare programs is the best way to defeat President Trump. In the past, Democrats have tended to nominate relatively moderate candidates, with even nominees like former President Barack Obama espousing platforms far less radical than the one favored by Mr. Sanders.Polls show that Democratic ideas for expanding government health care are popular, but the key details of a single-payer system can make many voters uneasy.In the debate over single-payer, several prominent Democratic candidates and officials have endorsed some version of \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a broad slogan that has been applied to a range of policies that would expand government-backed health care. In the purest conception, favored by Mr. Sanders, it involves the creation of a multitrillion dollar government health plan through which every American would obtain essential coverage. That approach, which is typical across most of the developed world, would guarantee universal coverage for all Americans and reduce health care costs for many, but it has long been seen as politically controversial because it would require so much public funding and would force many people who like their existing health insurance to change plans.Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who served in the Obama administration, said the distinctions between Democratic candidates had less to do with where they want to take the country than with how \u2014 and how quickly \u2014 they aim to get there. Their core priorities were largely identical, Mr. Bernstein said.\u201cThe candidates who are trying to carve out more moderate positions are essentially saying, \u2018I think we get from where we are to where we need to go through incremental steps.\u2019 The others are saying, \u2018No, we\u2019re into giant steps,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. On health care in particular, he said, \u201cThe real difference between the candidates on this is whether you believe we get where we need to go on health care through incremental change, or by leapfrogging to something much more universal than we have.\u201dThat Mr. Sanders would be a champion of giant steps is no surprise. His insurgent campaign in 2016 exploded the bounds of traditional debate in Democratic politics and thrust once-remote ideas \u2014 like European-style health care and free tuition at public colleges \u2014 to the center of debate on the left. He has shown every sign so far of approaching 2020 in a similar spirit, and describes other proposed policy solutions as inadequate half measures.In his announcement interview, Mr. Sanders offered scant acknowledgment of the practical and political obstacles to implementing his vision. He cast all impediments as the products of a corrupt political system that could be overcome through a mass mobilization of the popular will.[Read about Bernie Sanders\u2019s entrance into the 2020 race, and where he stands on the issues.]\u201cYou cannot make those changes unless there is a movement of people who make the Congress and the president an offer they cannot refuse,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.Invoking the watchword of his 2016 candidacy, Mr. Sanders said it was time to \u201ccomplete that revolution\u201d by enacting his health care and education policies. To him and his supporters, it is an article of faith that Democrats lost the 2016 election partly because Hillary Clinton failed to offer a vision of economic justice that might have captured some of the indignant energy of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.While throngs of Democrats have endorsed \u201cMedicare for all\u201d as a campaign slogan, Mr. Sanders has been nearly alone among the presidential candidates in demanding an immediate-term, full-blown version of the idea. Most of his leading rivals, like Ms. Warren and Senator Cory Booker, have backed the concept as an eventual goal as they pursue more pragmatic alternatives in the near term. (Ms. Harris endorsed eliminating private health insurance in a CNN town hall, but has also stressed her support for more modest ways of expanding government-backed care.)The leading Democratic candidates have given similarly hedged answers on the policy program known as the Green New Deal, a sweeping agenda to eliminate carbon emissions and guarantee full employment. Ms. Klobuchar on Monday called the proposals \u201caspirational.\u201dImageSenator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a liberal populist, declared that pushing for single-payer health care would be a mistake.CreditElizabeth Frantz/ReutersIf Mr. Sanders has given a resounding \u201cyes\u201d on single-payer, and most Democrats have offered versions of \u201cyes, but,\u201d Mr. Brown and Ms. Klobuchar stand out for their willingness to say \u201cno.\u201dBoth have long been skeptics of single-payer health care, viewing it as impractical and disruptive. They are both closely attuned to the sensibilities of the moderate Midwest, a region that delivered the presidency to Mr. Trump and that Democrats are determined to recapture in 2020.Mr. Brown, who has been visiting early primary states but has not decided whether to run for president, kicked off the long-distance debate over the weekend, arguing on CNN that pushing for single-payer would be a mistake.\u201cI want to help people now, and helping people now is building on the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Mr. Brown, a liberal populist whose diagnosis of the country\u2019s economic problems resembles Mr. Sanders\u2019s in important ways.ImageListen to \u2018The Daily\u2019: The Democratic Presidential Field (So Far)Democratic candidates are joining the 2020 presidential race with different answers to the same central question: What will it take to win against Donald Trump?transcriptBack to The Dailybars0:00/27:07-27:07transcriptListen to \u2018The Daily\u2019: The Democratic Presidential Field (So Far)Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Rachel Quester and Andy Mills, and edited by Lisa TobinDemocratic candidates are joining the 2020 presidential race with different answers to the same central question: What will it take to win against Donald Trump?michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro. This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d Today: Bernie Sanders enters a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates. How those candidates, who agree on so many social issues, are fighting to distinguish themselves in order to beat President Trump. It\u2019s Wednesday, February 20.archived recording (elizabeth warren)Good morning, Lawrence! [CHEERING] I stand here today to declare that I am a candidate for president of the United States of America.archived recording (kamala harris)I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for president of the United States.archived recording (amy klobuchar)To announce my candidacy for president of the United States.archived recording (kirsten gillibrand)I\u2019m filing an exploratory committee for president of the United States tonight!archived recording (cory booker)I\u2019m running for president because I want to address these issues.archived recording (bernie sanders)Hi, I\u2019m Bernie Sanders. I\u2019m running for president. And I\u2019m asking you today to be part of an unprecedented grassroots campaign \u2014michael barbaroAnd we are going to do this again. Alex Burns, what does Bernie Sanders\u2019s announcement mean for the 2020 presidential race?alexander burnsWell, it really means that now we have a full spectrum of Democratic candidates running, from sort of quasi-Marxist to avowedly moderate. That might sound like we now have this messy, shapeless field, but in reality, they are all basically debating the same central question, which is: Who has what it takes to beat Donald Trump? All the candidates, all the voters from different wings of the party basically agree that that is the overarching theme of this primary. They just all have different answers to that basic question.michael barbaroAnd as these Democratic candidates debate visions for beating Trump, I have to imagine that is a calculation about moving left and embracing kind of the politics of identity or tacking to the right to go after Trump voters, moderates.alexander burnsWell, you\u2019re sort of half-right there that there is a debate about whether the party needs to move to the left or to the center, but the fault lines are almost entirely about the economy. Then when it comes to matters of identity and different social justice issues, there is very, very little disagreement across the field. When you think about the issues that are now just consensus positions in the Democratic Party \u2014 support for gay marriage, support for abortion rights, support for very restrictive gun control laws \u2014 I don\u2019t know that you would have had a field. We didn\u2019t have a field 10 years ago, 15, 20 years ago, where there was basically no daylight on any of those issues \u2014 that the party is a liberal party on cultural matters, and the candidates themselves, obviously, have very different identities, but in terms of where they are on those issues, there\u2019s not a great deal of daylight. When it comes to stuff like health care and taxation and financial regulation, that\u2019s when you start to see the differences really open up. That right now is where the Democratic debate is going to focus.michael barbaroI guess I\u2019m curious \u2014 why is there such a wide spectrum on economic issues where there isn\u2019t when it comes to social issues?alexander burnsWell, this is going to get very weighty very fast. But I think you can look back over the last decade since the Great Recession and see just an enormous opening up of the range of economic debate in American politics \u2014 that in 1992 or 2000 you didn\u2019t have candidates running for the Democratic nomination for president calling themselves democratic socialist, or calling for just a colossal rewriting of the American economy. Now you have most candidates not calling themselves a democratic socialist, but calling for really transformational change of some kind or another. I think you can find the roots to that in the recession. I think you can find the roots to that in Bernie Sanders in 2015. And finally, I think you can see the Trump presidency just as an enormously disruptive force in this space. I think Democrats, liberal Democrats, see how the president blew up the debate around economics on the Republican side, especially on matters like trade and just the nature of the global economy, and there\u2019s no reason now for folks on the left not to do the same thing on their side.michael barbaroIt\u2019s kind of their turn to be incredibly disruptive when it comes to economics.alexander burnsRight. And they don\u2019t have on the right a mainstream, traditional Republican president who they worry will make them look outside the mainstream.michael barbaroRight.alexander burnsThat if you are campaigning against a President Jeb Bush or a President Marco Rubio who passed a very traditional, modest, middle-class tax cut and who says the right things about economic inequality and pursues sort of modest tinkering to Nafta, I think Democrats probably do feel a little bit more trepidation about campaigning on a really daring, disruptive, relatively far-left agenda. That\u2019s not the mood of the Democratic Party right now.michael barbaroRight. Instead you have a candidate on the right, an almost assured nominee, who deliberately provokes trade wars and tears up almost every major economic agreement we have signed as a country in the last 25 years.alexander burnsRight. So the Democrats aren\u2019t looking at Donald Trump and saying, we need to really make sure that we reassure the business community and make sure that we don\u2019t make folks on the center right nervous, because the president does those things already. So I think from Democrats close to the middle to Democrats well to the left, there is just this universal feeling that they\u2019ve got to go big on an economic vision in some way.michael barbaroSo let\u2019s start off at the most disruptive end of the economic spectrum here.archived recording (bernie sanders)Hi. I\u2019m Bernie Sanders. I\u2019m running for president.michael barbaroI imagine that that is Bernie Sanders, right? Why does he believe that he is best positioned to beat President Trump?archived recording (bernie sanders)Our campaign is about taking on the powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life.alexander burnsWell, the Sanders theory of the case in 2019 is very similar to what his theory was in 2015 and 2016, which is that if you\u2019re running against a candidate and Donald Trump in a political party like the Republican Party that is defined in the eyes of many voters as a party of great wealth and a party that is aligned with powerful corporate interests, you run right at that great wealth and those powerful corporate interests. And \u2014archived recording (bernie sanders)We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. We should not have a grotesque level of wealth inequality in which three billionaires now own more wealth than the bottom half of the country.alexander burnsPart of what has won him the passionate following he has is his directness in marshaling people\u2019s sense of political alienation and economic dissatisfaction in a really class-oriented way.archived recording (bernie sanders)Our campaign is about creating a government and economy that works for the many, not just the few.alexander burnsHe talks about trying to bring together voters who are economically distressed across lines of geography and culture and race in a way that other candidates don\u2019t necessarily.archived recording (bernie sanders)I am running for president because the time is long overdue for the United States to join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege, through a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d single-payer program.alexander burnsYou know, his theory is that if you talk about giving people government-guaranteed health care, that appeals as much to an African-American woman in Los Angeles as it does to a white coal miner in West Virginia. That theory has not really been tested the way Bernie Sanders would like to test it. There is very, very substantial evidence from the last few rounds of national elections that culture is such a dominant force in American elections that I think it does cast some doubt on whether that would work in a general election, because \u2014archived recording (bernie sanders)Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution. Now it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.alexander burnsYou know, he\u2019s talking about revolution. That\u2019s the word he uses, and he uses it for a reason.michael barbaroSo the question here is, can he win a race that\u2019s all about class? And will that work? Can he make it all about the 1 percent versus the 99 percent and actually succeed?alexander burnsRight. And the question is, does the 99 percent see themselves as a coherent entity?michael barbaroRight.alexander burnsOr do other kinds of social and cultural divisions make the aspiration to a cross-racial national workers\u2019 campaign just sort of a fantasy?michael barbaroRight. We\u2019d probably know if there was a 99 percent club of voters that saw itself as one entity waiting to be tapped.alexander burnsAnytime a politician tells you that 80 percent of people agree strongly with their position on something as sensitive as health care or the bedrock nature of the American economy.michael barbaroThey\u2019re estimating.alexander burnsThey\u2019re estimating.michael barbaroSo who\u2019s next on this Democratic spectrum, remembering that we\u2019re going kind of left to less left?alexander burnsWell, a lot of these people are tricky to categorize ideologically. But I think the person you would have to put closest to Bernie Sanders but with some very, very significant philosophical and personal modifications is Elizabeth Warren.archived recording (elizabeth warren)The middle-class squeeze is real, and millions of families can barely breathe. It is not right. [CHEERING]alexander burnsShe\u2019s a candidate who is running a populist campaign.archived recording (elizabeth warren)Hardworking people are up against a small group that holds far too much power, not just in our economy but also in our democracy.alexander burnsShe is targeting banks, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies.archived recording (elizabeth warren)And when giant corporations and their leaders cheat their customers, stomp out their competitors and rob their workers, let\u2019s prosecute them. [CHEERING]alexander burnsBut unlike Bernie Sanders, she\u2019s very explicit about calling herself a capitalist.archived recording (elizabeth warren)We can\u2019t afford just to tinker around the edges, a tax credit here, a regulation there. Our fight is for big structural change.alexander burnsThat is a huge tonal and substantive difference from Bernie Sanders. She\u2019s not talking about blowing up and incinerating the entire system and rebuilding it from the ground up. She is talking about using all the levers of power in government to take control of a system that she argues is out of control.michael barbaroRight. So cleaning it up, not blowing it up.alexander burnsRight.archived recording (elizabeth warren)We need to change the rules to clean up Washington. End the corruption.michael barbaroSo in that sense she would be appealing to the Trump voters\u2019 same desire to drain the swamp.alexander burnsIf there is a drain-the-swamp candidate in the Democratic primary, it is Elizabeth Warren. Corruption is the central theme of her campaign as much as anything else.archived recording (elizabeth warren)I have proposed the strongest and most comprehensive anti-corruption laws since Watergate.alexander burnsBut the basic political logic of a Warren campaign is not all that different from the logic of a Sanders campaign. It\u2019s about harnessing alienation with the political system. It\u2019s about telling people that, yeah, you\u2019re right, the economy is rigged and I\u2019m going to do something very, very drastic about it.archived recording (elizabeth warren)We need to take power in Washington away from the wealthy and well-connected and put it back in the hands of the people, where it belongs.alexander burnsHer campaign represents, again, not a Sanders-like rejection of what\u2019s normal, but definitely a rejection of what\u2019s normal.michael barbaroSo what is the risk of a Warren-like candidate, if, by your description, she\u2019s kind of a Democratic Trump-like candidate in her attempts to sell herself as a fixer of a broken system?alexander burnsThere are a couple risks in a Warren candidacy. The biggest one is she is putting, essentially, all her chips on the idea that voters are alienated from the economy and that is going to be the consuming issue for them in this election. It\u2019s a bet that people are not just a little bit dissatisfied with how things are working right now, that they are profoundly dissatisfied and that whatever other issues they may care about, it\u2019s issues about the economy and the power of corporations that matter more than anything else.michael barbaroSo her focus may be too narrow.alexander burnsWell, we just don\u2019t know what voters are going to care about most a year from now. And in some ways it\u2019s a daring bet, in some ways it\u2019s a very risky bet to think that these core issues that have been the issues that have defined your career are going to be the decisive issues first in the primary, then in the general election. It\u2019s not that she only talks about these issues, but I was in Iowa with her for a day pretty recently, and the balance of themes related to corruption and corporate power versus all other themes in her stump speech \u2014 it\u2019s just overwhelmingly lopsided.michael barbaroWho is in the next band over?alexander burnsSo if you think of Sanders and Warren, who are candidates really preoccupied with economic populism and whose basic campaign bargain is, let\u2019s tax the wealthy and go after corporations in order to create new welfare benefits for other people, you then get into this next band of candidates, and they\u2019re a little bit harder to characterize ideologically. Candidates like Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, these are candidates who are all campaigning as liberals and who have endorsed big liberal goals.archived recording (kamala harris)I am running to declare education is a fundamental right.archived recording (kirsten gillibrand)I believe that health care should be a right and not a privilege.archived recording (cory booker)People in America are losing faith that this nation will work for them.archived recording (kamala harris)And we will guarantee that right with universal pre-K and debt-free college.archived recording (kirsten gillibrand)I believe we should have better public schools, because it shouldn\u2019t matter what block you grow up on.archived recording (cory booker)My record as a mayor, my record as a senator is fighting those interests that are trying to screw people. And when it comes to defending folks, I will be ferocious.alexander burnsBut they are much more cautious about the way they talk about enacting that change.archived recordingWhat is your solution to ensure that people have access to quality health care at an affordable price? And does that solution involve cutting insurance companies, as we know them, out of the equation?alexander burnsWe saw this very memorably with Kamala Harris in her first few days as a candidate when she, first, in a CNN event, endorsed getting rid of the private health care system entirely.archived recording (kamala harris)I believe the solution, and I actually feel very strongly about this, is that we need to have Medicare for all. That\u2019s just the bottom line.alexander burnsThe Bernie Sanders-like position. And then \u2014archived recordingSenator Harris is now backtracking a bit on her call to eliminate private health insurers. Her spokesman tells us she is open to more moderate plans that preserve the private health care industry.alexander burnsQuickly clarified that she favors any number of ways of getting to universal health care coverage, not necessarily the Bernie Sanders approach. Her signature economic proposal is a big tax cut.archived recording (kamala harris)We will deliver the largest working- and middle-class tax cut in a generation. [CHEERING]alexander burnsTargeted at the middle class, paid for by increasing taxes and changing the kinds of taxes that are applied to much wealthier people.archived recording (kamala harris)We\u2019ll pay for it by reversing this administration\u2019s giveaways to the top big corporations and the top 1 percent. [CHEERING]alexander burnsThat is a much more conventional way of thinking about how you gain credibility on the economy.archived recording (cory booker)Our planet is in peril and we need to be bold. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I signed onto the resolution and co-sponsored the resolution for the Green New Deal.alexander burnsI think that once you get to Cory Booker, you\u2019re even a couple clicks closer to the political center.archived recording (cory booker)And there\u2019s a lot of people now that are going back on the Green New Deal. They\u2019re like, oh, it\u2019s impractical, oh, it\u2019s too expensive, oh, it\u2019s all of this. If we used to govern our dreams that way, we would have never gone to the moon. God, that\u2019s impractical. You see that ball in the sky?alexander burnsHe endorses the Green New Deal as sort of an aspirational goal, but he doesn\u2019t endorse the full program, wouldn\u2019t expect to enact it as president.archived recording (cory booker)And my parents taught me reach for the moon, reach for the stars even if you come up short, at least you\u2019re going to be hovering above the ground. You\u2019ll be soaring, young man.alexander burnsHe is somebody who you start to hear speaking in more pragmatic terms about simply what he considers possible in a divided government.archived recording (cory booker)And when the planet has been in peril in the past, who came forward to save Earth from the scourge of Nazi and totalitarian regimes? We came forward.michael barbaroI imagine that the idea for this group of Democratic candidates is to appeal to every conceivable voter by seeming pragmatic and flexible, a bit malleable. But I imagine that the risk here is gaining a reputation for being inauthentic, maybe even phony.alexander burnsYeah. The risk is that you end up trying to be all things to all people and being nothing in particular to anybody. And this is a particularly pointed distinction on economic issues and issues related to inequality and corporate power \u2014 that if you\u2019re a candidate who talks big on taking on health insurance companies, taking on banks, making sure that the 99 percent start catching up with the 1 percent, people might at some point expect you to propose policy ideas that would actually achieve that outcome. And there\u2019s a great risk in being seen as a candidate who endorses a bunch of very grand liberal goals, and then there\u2019s always a but.michael barbaroRight. I\u2019m thinking, of course, of Hillary Clinton taking Wall Street money while calling for Wall Street reform.alexander burnsIf there\u2019s one consistent theme we\u2019ve seen in politics over the last few years in both parties, it\u2019s the importance of personal and ideological authenticity. And that is something that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren obviously have in spades. And once you start to get two candidates who are trying to bridge divides in the party, it just becomes more complicated. If you are Donald Trump, what you\u2019re hoping for is a Democratic candidate who will either be so far left that they cannot appeal to the middle or a candidate who has tied themselves into an ideological pretzel and who you can just ridicule as inauthentic. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody in the Democratic race at this point who has reached that pretzel status, but we will see, especially for these candidates who are trying to straddle the left and the center, who are trying to be both revolutionary and exciting and also non-threatening to voters who are more traditional voters, a long primary is going to test whether the core of who they are really fits that description.michael barbaroSo you\u2019re kind of tracking pretzel status. So that leaves us with the actual moderates. And who are they so far?alexander burnsWell, right now \u2014archived recording (amy klobuchar)For too long, leaders in Washington have sat on the sidelines while others tried to figure out what to do about the changing economy and its impact on our lives.alexander burnsThere\u2019s really only one major candidate in the race who is positioning herself very directly as a moderate, and that\u2019s Amy Klobuchar. We have seen her, more than any other candidate, willing to just say no to some of the really big liberal trophy ideas, like \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d like free college.archived recordingYes or no. Would you support free college for all?archived recording (amy klobuchar)No. I am not for free four-year college for all. No. Thank you.alexander burnsWe have talked about candidates who say yes, but. But she\u2019s a candidate who just says no.archived recording (amy klobuchar)I wish \u2014 if I was a magic genie and could give that to everyone, and we could afford it, I would. I\u2019m just trying to find a mix of incentives.alexander burnsAnd we\u2019re going to see whether there is an appetite for that in the Democratic Party, somebody who says, I\u2019m just going to level with you. I\u2019m not going to do that because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. Here are the things I am going to do.archived recording (amy klobuchar)Getting to universal health care and bringing down \u2014 bringing down the cost of prescription drugs.alexander burnsIt\u2019s a bet that voters will reward candor and realism. Look, if you\u2019re Amy Klobuchar, you\u2019re taking a big risk on the idea that voters will accept less if they think that they can get it for sure as opposed to promising them more with some uncertainty about whether it\u2019s achievable.archived recordingIt is time to organize, time to galvanize, time to take back our democracy. It\u2019s time, America.alexander burnsA really significant portion of the Democratic Party self-identifies as moderate \u2014 not conservative, but they are suspicious of \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d They are suspicious of some of the really grand transformational promises that they hear from the more liberal candidates. And right now, if you split up the pie on the left between the candidates we\u2019ve talked about, there is a big slice of pie left closer to the political center. And Amy Klobuchar is the only person, with the possible exception of Cory Booker, who\u2019s going right at it. So the space that she\u2019s in could get crowded if suddenly Joe Biden runs and Mike Bloomberg runs and Terry McAuliffe or John Hickenlooper, former governors from Virginia and Colorado, run.michael barbaroThen she won\u2019t be alone.alexander burnsThat middle space would get real crowded.michael barbaroAlex, more broadly, it feels like the risk here in the Democrats building their message and their platforms around the economy and running against President Trump is that the economy is doing pretty well. Isn\u2019t it possible that in a year or so, if the economy stays doing this well, that voters are going to look around and see all of the Democratic Party promising to blow things up, and they\u2019re going to think to themselves, I don\u2019t want to blow up this system that\u2019s working reasonably well for me?alexander burnsIt\u2019s entirely possible. And one of the ironies of the race that we\u2019re seeing so far is Donald Trump as kind of a status quo candidate, as a let\u2019s-not-shake-things-up-too-much candidate on the specific issue of the economy. He\u2019s obviously not that kind of candidate or president more generally. But this is also a place where, in some ways, Democrats are taking a lesson from Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2016. I think we all remember when Trump was out there talking about \u201cmake America great again\u201d that one of the really big Democratic applause lines was, America is already great. And it turns out that a lot of voters did not agree with that. And the president is counting on that working for him in 2020.michael barbaroSo make America\u2019s economy greater could basically be the Democratic Party slogan for 2020?alexander burnsAbsolutely. The core of the Democratic message in 2020 will almost certainly be about the economy, unless we have some kind of catastrophic intervening event that nobody is hoping for, and because they feel that the economic message is what was missing last time. They all basically agree with each other, and they all basically agree with Hillary Clinton on social and cultural issues that are at the heart of American politics. And they all disagree strongly with Donald Trump on those issues. Where they don\u2019t agree with each other and where the party has not yet found its identity on the national level is on these economic issues.michael barbaroAnd it\u2019s where they don\u2019t know where the country is.alexander burnsIt\u2019s where they don\u2019t know where a controlling coalition of voters can be found. They know what it looks like to win a midterm election with an economic message. They know what it looks like to lose a presidential election with a weak economic message. They don\u2019t yet know what it means to put together a winning message on the economy in the Trump era in a presidential race.michael barbaroAlex, thank you very much.alexander burnsThank you.Mr. Brown, who has proposed opening the Medicare program to people as young as 50, suggested that a European-style system would be unsettling for people who \u201cwould have their insurance plans canceled and move into a government plan.\u201dMs. Klobuchar, a more traditional moderate, highlighted a similar set of alternatives to a single-payer system on Monday, including greatly expanding access to the Medicaid program. She also pushed back on Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal for free four-year college, calling it unaffordable and calling for expanded economic opportunities for people who do not attend college.\u201cIf I was a magic genie and could give that to everyone and we could afford it, I would,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said, underscoring her assessment of the idea\u2019s practicality.In a field stocked with charismatic liberals, there is considerable risk for any candidate who attempts to deflate the grandest hopes of the left. Even voters who do not demand Sanders-like ideological purity could opt for any number of alternatives if they are put off by a reality check of Klobuchar-like bluntness.Yet for Ms. Klobuchar \u2014 and Mr. Brown, if he runs \u2014 giving unwanted news to the Democratic base may amount to a bet that voters will reward them for their candor. There is some reason to believe that wager might pay off in an election when Democratic voters appear less concerned with ideological litmus tests than with defeating Mr. Trump.Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who is advising another potential 2020 contender, former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, argued that Democratic voters are open to a range of methods for achieving their social goals, so long as the candidates proposing them are progressive and sincere in their intentions.\u201cThe framing of this \u2014 that there\u2019s a set of ideologically pure primary voters who have only one idea about how to address climate change or secure affordable universal health care \u2014 is just wrong,\u201d Ms. Greenberg said."}, {"title": "On Politics: Inside Trump\u2019s War on the Investigations Encircling Him", "category": "Politics", "id": "bd4cc90c-d298-4629-b8f5-42880fe0ba6d", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/us/politics/trump-investigations-special-counsel.html", "publishdate": 20190220, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Wednesday morning.

And here are a few takeaways.\u2022 A day after California filed a lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s emergency declaration on the border, the Transportation Department said it was exploring legal options to claw back $2.5 billion in federal funds it has already spent on the state\u2019s high-speed rail network. The Trump administration also said it was terminating a $929 million federal grant for the program.\u2022 House Democrats opened an inquiry into a proposed nuclear power venture in Saudi Arabia that could expose conflicts of interests in the Trump administration and possible violations of law.\u2022 Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to spend billions of dollars to build his border wall involves more than his invocation of emergency powers to redirect military construction funds. Here\u2019s how he plans to tap into $2.5 billion in other Pentagon funds, too.\u2022 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts introduced a universal child care proposal that would create a network of government-funded child care centers, which would be free for low-income families and partly subsidized for others.\u2022 In 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders framed his presidential platform as a transformation of the Democratic Party. But as he enters the 2020 presidential race, his progressive ideas have increasingly become part of the Democratic mainstream.\u2022 Justice Clarence Thomas called for the Supreme Court to reconsider New York Times v.

The specialist, Jay Alix, has accused McKinsey of improperly profiting off the reorganizations it worked on.Cliff White, director of the Office of the United States Trustee Program, the unit of the Justice Department that oversees the bankruptcy court system, said McKinsey had \u201cfailed to satisfy its obligations under bankruptcy law and demonstrated a lack of candor.\u201dHe added, \u201cIf this conduct is repeated in future cases, we will seek even more far-reaching remedies.\u201dThe settlement would end the Justice Department\u2019s court-ordered mediation with McKinsey over its work for three bankrupt companies: Alpha Natural Resources, Westmoreland Coal and SunEdison. The agreement requires approval by bankruptcy judges in Richmond, Va.; Houston; and New York City.McKinsey was also in mediation with Mr. Alix, who formed a small investment company that bought some of the companies\u2019 unsecured debt as part of his efforts to expose what he has called improper conduct by McKinsey. The mediation was an unusual joint step ordered by three bankruptcy court judges intended to head off a full trial.Mr. Alix said Tuesday that he and McKinsey had failed to reach an agreement and that he would press his claims in court, including that McKinsey improperly profited from stakes in bankrupt client companies held by its investment division, MIO Partners.\u201cThis is not really the last stop on the train,\u201d he said of the mediated settlement with the Justice Department. \u201cMcKinsey today is not in compliance with the United States bankruptcy code in any of these cases, and they need to be held accountable.\u201dUnder the settlement, the department said it would no longer investigate McKinsey\u2019s disclosures in the 14 bankruptcies the firm has advised since it began advising insolvent clients in 2001. But it reserved the right to file new complaints if it gets new information that McKinsey has committed fraud or is not \u201cdisinterested,\u201d as required, in one or more of those cases.A McKinsey spokeswoman said the firm had agreed to the settlement \u201cin order to move forward and focus on serving its clients.\u201dShe said the settlement did not require McKinsey to admit that its disclosures were insufficient or noncompliant, and did \u201cnot in any way constitute an admission of liability or misconduct by McKinsey or any of its employees, officers, directors or agents.\u201dThe company said it had already taken steps to change its disclosure practices in response to guidance from the Office of the United States Trustee.Bankruptcy law requires all professionals working on a case to disclose business relationships so the courts and other parties can watch for improper arrangements or movement of assets of the distressed companies.McKinsey has recently provided information on some connections, but only after considerable prodding and sometimes only in a private meeting with the judge, rather than in open court.Mr. Alix has accused McKinsey of using those connections to earn much more than its court-approved fees: He has filed pleadings with the courts claiming that McKinsey earned an additional $22 million in SunEdison\u2019s bankruptcy through a complicated series of accounting manipulations. He has also accused McKinsey of improperly earning a $50 million profit by investing in Alpha\u2019s secured debt while serving as Alpha\u2019s adviser.The settlement with the Justice Department does not cover those allegations, which were wider ranging than those brought by the Justice Department, and McKinsey has denied them.Mr. Alix\u2019s mediation with McKinsey was handled by the same mediator who helped McKinsey and the Justice Department reach their settlement, Judge Marvin Isgur of the bankruptcy court in Houston.The Justice Department said the $15 million from McKinsey was \u201cone of the highest repayments made by a bankruptcy professional for alleged noncompliance with disclosure rules.\u201d But the penalty is only about a third of the fees McKinsey has billed for while advising the three companies.SunEdison, a builder of renewable energy projects, paid McKinsey $16 million for bankruptcy work. Alpha Natural Resources, a coal company, paid about $20 million. And Westmoreland Coal has billed about $6 million so far. Westmoreland\u2019s bankruptcy has not yet been settled, and McKinsey has not yet been approved to work on the case, much less been paid.Each will get $5 million for distribution to their creditors, whose recoveries will be improved. In cases where McKinsey itself was a creditor, it will not receive any new distributions, the Justice Department said.The settlement was comparatively small in the corporate world, but in the niche of corporate bankruptcies, it was unusually large, said Lynn M. LoPucki, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who runs a bankruptcy database that includes fees and fee reductions.\u201cThis is a different environment,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this environment, they don\u2019t take money away from the professionals.\u201d"}, {"title": "Democrats Want to Tax the Wealthy. Many Voters Agree.", "category": "Business", "id": "7c0379ae-1317-4531-ad00-6d7002f582a6", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/business/economy/wealth-tax-elizabeth-warren.html", "publishdate": 20190220, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/business/20TAXSURVEY1/20TAXSURVEY1-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "As leading Democrats roll out proposals to increase taxes on the rich, the American people are largely behind them.A majority of people support Democratic proposals to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, according to a poll conducted this month for The New York Times by the online research platform SurveyMonkey, though their opinions vary between specific plans. Voters overwhelmingly see income inequality as a problem the government should be trying to address.Support for taxing the rich cuts across party lines: A majority of Republicans support a proposal from Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic presidential candidate, to tax a group of the wealthiest Americans on their net worth. Views on raising the top income-tax rate are more sharply split.The tax-the-rich sentiment is strongest by far among Democrats, who see it as a moral issue. Subscribing to a view expressed recently by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the first-term New York Democrat, nearly two-thirds of Democrats say it is immoral to have an economic system where some people have billions of dollars while others have very little. \u201cThey\u2019re not paying their fair share,\u201d said one Democrat, Fred Wood, a retired teacher in Williamsport, Pa. \u201cIt\u2019s just not right when folks cannot afford health care.\u201d Polling support is by no means a guarantee that Americans would elect a tax-the-rich challenger to President Trump \u2014 who mused as a candidate about raising taxes on the rich but as president signed a $1.5 trillion tax cut that reduced the top marginal income tax rate and primarily benefits high earners. Polls by Gallup and other organizations over the decades have regularly found that a majority of Americans believe that corporations and the wealthy pay too little in taxes, but voters have frequently elected presidents who cut those taxes, instead. What appears different this time, analysts say, is the emphasis that leading Democratic candidates are placing on taxing the rich. \u201cThis is about politicians catching up to where Americans have been,\u201d said Leslie McCall, a political scientist at the CUNY Graduate Center. As a result, progressive policy hands say they are increasingly confident that if a Democrat wins the White House and the party gains full control of Congress, taxes on the rich will go up. That is partly because of the \u201cfinally dawning realization among Democrats that taxing the rich is good politics along with good policy,\u201d said Michael Linden, a fellow at the liberal Roosevelt Institute.\u201cMy bet is that it won't be one big thing\u201d that ends up raising taxes on the rich, Mr. Linden said. \u201cI bet it will be a lot of medium-sized things. A higher top rate, for sure. Rooting out or limiting some of the tax expenditures that disproportionately benefit the rich. I think the corporate rate will start to creep back up. And I think new taxes like a wealth tax, or some other form of capital taxation, are very likely.\u201dMore Democrats are taking up the theme.Rising inequality and policies to fight it have emerged as a central theme in the Democratic primary campaign. Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who three years ago railed against \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d in an insurgent bid for the Democratic nomination, said on Tuesday that he would again seek the nomination on a platform of free public college and \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d This time around, he will face competition for the left flank of his party, including from Ms. Warren, who has proposed taxing the assets \u2014 not just the annual income \u2014 of the richest Americans to pay for universal child care.\u201cAcross party lines, Americans want the very wealthiest families to pay their fair share so we can have an economy that works for everyone,\u201d Ms. Warren said in a statement in response to the polling for The Times. Such proposals are likely to draw strong support from a Democratic electorate that has shifted sharply to the left since Mr. Sanders\u2019s last run. Eighty-seven percent of Democrats in the Times poll said the government should seek to reduce the wealth gap.But it isn\u2019t just Democrats who are concerned by inequality. A majority of independents, and substantial minorities of Republicans, want the government to tackle the issue. And a slim majority of Republicans support a wealth tax like the one Ms. Warren has proposed.Virginia Connolly is a conservative Republican who supports President Trump and wants to build a wall on the Mexican border. But she says she wants to tax wealthy Americans to pay for programs for veterans, children and the homeless.\u201cI think that raising taxes on the rich should have happened a long time ago,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rich, what are they going to do with all that money?\u201dMs. Connolly, 47, runs a business cleaning homes in DeLand, Fla., north of Orlando. When that work failed to pay her bills, she took a part-time job at Winn-Dixie, a grocery store chain where she earns $14 an hour. Even so, she barely makes enough to feed herself and her three children.A wealth tax finds support, but challenges loom. The Times poll found strong support for a wealth tax akin to Ms. Warren\u2019s plan. Sixty-one percent of Americans said they approved of imposing a 2 percent tax on the wealth of households with a net worth of more than $50 million. (Under Ms. Warren\u2019s plan, the rate would rise to 3 percent on wealth over $1 billion, but the Times survey didn\u2019t ask about that provision.) An earlier Morning Consult poll found similar results.\u201cWe pay taxes on our property, why not on your wealth?\u201d said Gary Montoya, a school safety officer in Panama City, Fla.Mr. Montoya, 39, is a registered Republican and a supporter of Mr. Trump. But he said taxes on the rich must rise to reduce the federal budget deficit, among other priorities.The idea of a wealth tax, however, is newly prominent in American politics, and it isn\u2019t clear whether support will hold up. Republicans haven\u2019t had time to attack the policy, as they have with the estate tax, and it would face legal challenges if enacted. Moreover, voters used to hearing about income-tax rates might not fully understand the idea of a wealth tax, said Vanessa Williamson, a political scientist at the Brookings Institution who has studied public opinion on taxation.The wealth tax also raises practical challenges that could turn off some voters. Kris Stallard, a data analyst in Tulsa, Okla., says he wants to raise taxes on the rich, and has no problem with a wealth tax in principle. But he questions how it would work in practice.\u201cYou might own houses, businesses, that sort of thing,\u201d said Mr. Stallard, a Democrat. \u201cIs the government going to take parts of businesses from people?\u201dOn higher income-tax rates, a sharper split emerges. Other Democrats are taking a more traditional approach to taxing the rich: raising income taxes on the highest earners. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has proposed a marginal rate as high as 70 percent on annual income over $10 million. The top rate today is 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent before the Republican tax law that passed in late 2017.Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposal avoids the legal and logistical challenges of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan. And it is just as popular with Democrats, 75 percent of whom support the idea. But it is less popular over all. Only a narrow majority of Americans, 51 percent, support the idea. Republicans oppose it by a ratio of more than two to one. A self-described \u201cleft-leaning independent,\u201d Kathy Holmes could be the sort of voter Democrats need to win to defeat Mr. Trump. A small-business owner in Kansas City, Mo., Ms. Holmes once voted for Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who sought the presidency twice in the 1990s, but these days mostly supports Democrats. Still, she says she has been disappointed by both parties, and is intrigued by the possible candidacy of the former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz.Ms. Holmes, 54, said she would like to see the rich pay more in taxes. But she said a 70 percent rate \u201ccould get a little too out of control.\u201d She said higher taxes on the rich should be a means to an end, not an end unto themselves.\u201cI don\u2019t think that they should be incredibly penalized for being wealthy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough balance between free enterprise and \u2018go for it and be a gazillionaire.\u2019\u201dAbout the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 9,974 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Feb. 4 to Feb. 10. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 1.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant."}, {"title": "Estonia Orders Danske Bank Out After Money-Laundering Scandal", "category": "Business", "id": "1108311c-397b-42a5-9ba5-3f13a7b08265", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/business/danske-bank-estonia-money-laundering.html", "publishdate": 20190220, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/21/business/21DANSKE/merlin_150887589_bdcdaad6-be4e-496d-b926-1a80c772bb82-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "COPENHAGEN \u2014 Regulators in Estonia have ordered Danske Bank to leave the country within eight months, arguing that the Danish bank\u2019s $230 billion money-laundering scandal had tarnished the reputation of Estonia\u2019s financial market.Danske Bank, which is facing investigations by the United States Department of Justice and other authorities, said it would comply with the order. Additionally, Danske, the largest lender in Denmark, said it would stop offering banking services in Russia, Latvia and Lithuania as part of a previously announced move to focus on its core Nordic market.An internal report by Danske revealed in September that the bank had failed for years to prevent suspected money laundering involving thousands of customers at its branch in Tallinn, Estonia. The report prompted Danske\u2019s chief executive and chairman to step down. In December, the police in Estonia arrested 10 former Danske employees on charges that they had been involved in a network of money launderers.The scandal \u201chas dealt a serious blow to the transparency, credibility and reputation of the Estonian financial market,\u201d Kilvar Kessler, the chairman of the management board of the Estonian financial regulator, said in a written statement on Tuesday.Mr. Kessler also took a swipe at Danish financial regulators for having \u201chandled the bank softly.\u201d The two regulatory bodies have repeatedly blamed each other for not preventing or stopping the alleged fraud sooner.The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority declined on Wednesday to respond to Mr. Kessler\u2019s comments, but referred to a statement last month that it had lived up to its responsibility to press Danske Bank about its efforts to prevent money laundering. The agency said \u201cthat the bank did not always provide the F.S.A. with accurate information.\u201d The agency has asked Danish lawmakers to increase its powers and staff.On Monday, the European Banking Authority said it had begun an investigation into both the Danish and Estonian financial authorities for possible breach of their obligations toward Danske Bank.The scandal\u2019s full size is not yet known, but at one point, in 2008, the tiny Estonian branch delivered close to 10 percent of Danske Bank\u2019s annual profit seemingly without attracting scrutiny from the bank\u2019s Danish headquarters.Danske Bank, responding to the Estonian order to leave the country, acknowledged that the money laundering case \u201chas had a negative impact on Estonian society.\u201d\u201cWe are sorry to be leaving Estonia against this background,\u201d the bank said, \u201cbut we understand the severity with which the Estonian F.S.A. looks at this case, and we will close down our remaining activities as requested.

In a separate statement, the company said that \u201cthe inquiries are related to news reports\u201d about the welter of lawsuits it faces from consumers who claim its talc products caused cancers.The New York Times and Reuters reported in December on internal documents that showed decades of communications within the company about the risk of asbestos in its talc products even as Johnson & Johnson fought to keep negative information out of the public eye.In the days after the reports were published, the company\u2019s stock sank more than 12 percent. It had not fully regained the losses as of Wednesday.Johnson & Johnson, which faces around 13,000 lawsuits in which its body powders are blamed for causing ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, has stood by the safety of its products. It said on Wednesday that \u201cdecades of independent tests by regulators and the world\u2019s leading labs prove Johnson & Johnson\u2019s baby powder is safe and asbestos-free, and does not cause cancer.\u201dSome of the talc suits have gone to trial.

But American officials are increasingly focused on ensuring that China, which has often reneged on promises to past administrations, actually adheres to any agreement.Whether a substantive deal can be reached in the coming days remains unclear. So far, the Chinese have largely reiterated promises to allow foreign car companies and banks freer access to the Chinese market and to increase purchases of American goods, including soybeans and semiconductors.In recent meetings, the Chinese made only vague commitments on structural issues, including protecting intellectual property and paring back heavy subsidies to state-owned enterprises, said William Reinsch, a former United States trade official and now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\u201cThe Chinese have not yet put forward anything close to what we\u2019re asking on the so-called structural issues,\u201d Mr. Reinsch said. \u201cThere are differences of opinion on whether they will.\u201dComplicating matters is Mr. Trump, who in recent days has appeared to undercut his advisers by saying that talks might outlast a March deadline that the president himself set in an effort to pressure China to cut a deal.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you exactly the timing,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Tuesday, adding that the deadline he had set of midnight on March 1 \u201cis not a magical date. A lot of things can happen.\u201dOn Thursday morning, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, flanked by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the economic advisers Larry Kudlow and Peter Navarro, met with Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier, and a team of Chinese advisers in the executive office building next to the White House. The meeting kicked off two days of top-level talks in which Mr. Lighthizer, a longtime China critic, hopes to secure promises from Beijing to make lasting structural changes to its economy.Mr. Trump plans to meet with Mr. Liu, the top trade adviser to President Xi Jinping of China, in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon. It will be the second such meeting between the two men in a matter of weeks.Much of the recent discussion has centered on deadlines and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that China keeps any promises for economic reforms. Mr. Lighthizer, Mr. Navarro and other trade advisers have often called out China for promising changes to American officials in the past, but then failing to follow through. The administration is considering a process that would allow tariffs to kick back in if the Chinese are found to have reneged on a commitment.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has signaled that he is growing tired of the grinding pace of the negotiations, the infighting among his economic advisers and the increasing calls from rich Republican donors to wind down the trade dispute with China, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. Despite his desire to cut a deal quickly, increasing criticism from Democrats about being soft on China has pushed Mr. Trump to consider extending the talks in hopes of getting more concessions.The tone of the negotiations between the two nations has grown more stern, this person said. In recent meetings, Chinese officials have pushed back more aggressively against the administration\u2019s accusations that China has engaged in a pattern of illegally obtaining American technology and information and that it has failed to make any changes the United States has called for.American officials have come to realize that China has been repackaging promised reforms and trying to sell them as concessions to Mr. Trump. This has caused deep frustration among the administration\u2019s China hard-liners, including Mr. Navarro and Mr. Lighthizer, who have been skeptical that China will actually agree to new, substantive commitments.In the run-up to this week\u2019s meeting, both sides have tried to begin formalizing the framework of an agreement around six memorandums of understanding. However, a detailed draft text of an agreement has not yet been written.\u201cThe Chinese are playing for an extension,\u201d said Michael Pillsbury, a Hudson Institute scholar who advises the Trump administration and speaks regularly with Chinese officials. \u201cThat\u2019s one of their top goals right now.\u201dMr. Pillsbury said that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s hints about extending the deadline, they are expecting he will follow through on his \u201ctariff man\u201d instincts and raise levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on March 2. He said he believes that China has prepared a package of structural concessions to offer the United States after those tariffs are increased in an effort to get all the tariffs rolled back.The administration has been searching for concrete, commercially based criteria for performance outcomes \u2014 not just superficial legal changes that leave no impact on the ground. For example, even though China has changed laws to allow foreign companies greater access to its markets, a variety of regulatory barriers and licensing requirements continue to prevent foreign companies from operating freely, said Scott Kennedy, a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\u201cEven if they could agree to some sort of standards on structural reforms, having them come to agreement on what enforcement would look like, that\u2019s even further of a stretch,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said of the talks.Both countries have also floated measures that could undermine years of efforts aimed at making China\u2019s economy more market oriented. The offers include large state-directed purchases of technological goods, natural gas and soybeans, as well as closer management of China\u2019s currency. Those measures would violate Chinese promises to the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund.But that may matter little to Mr. Trump, who has been largely focused on narrowing the trade gap between the two countries by getting China to buy more American products. The United States\u2019 trade deficit with China is likely to increase in 2019, said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, increasing pressure on Mr. Trump to reach a deal that involves more American products flowing East.\u201cIt\u2019s coming from, how do we close the bilateral goods deficit really fast,\u201d Mr. Scissors said. \u201cWe need large, quick purchases from the Chinese so the president isn\u2019t ripped to pieces for violating the metric he ran on in 2016.\u201dChina\u2019s recent offers have included buying $200 billion of American semiconductors over the next six years, in addition to purchases of soybeans and natural gas. The eye-popping figure would help to reduce the $382 billion trade deficit in goods that the United States ran up with China last year, a metric that Mr. Trump often sees as evidence of a failed economic relationship.In return for buying more American products, the Chinese have asked Mr. Trump not to follow through on his threat to increase tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent \u2014 and to hopefully remove the tariffs entirely. They have also pushed the United States to remove restrictions on exports of high-tech products to China as well as constraints on Chinese investments in the United States.Many analysts caution that China\u2019s offer to buy large quantities of semiconductors is largely unrealistic, and would encourage the Chinese state to interfere in its economy to accomplish political goals, a practice past American administrations have tried to discourage.And it would also deliver further economic benefit to China in the long run. In order to increase the dollar value of shipments to China, the Chinese proposal would have American semiconductor companies move finishing and testing facilities from third countries like Vietnam and Malaysia into China, inflating the value of shipments directly from the United States to China while bolstering Chinese industry.John Neuffer, the president and chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said the offer raised numerous questions and threatened to sidetrack negotiations away from more important discussions surrounding China\u2019s infringement on intellectual property and state subsidies.\u201cThe numbers simply don\u2019t add up,\u201d Mr. Neuffer said, \u201cand we are concerned the offer would do little more than rearrange U.S. supply chains and artificially drive them deeper into China.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s advisers have also pressed China to refrain from further devaluing its currency to lift its economy as American tariffs bite. A drop in the value of the Chinese currency in the past year has already neutralized much of the economic effect of the 10 percent tariffs that Mr. Trump placed on roughly $200 billion of Chinese exports to the United States, said Eswar Prasad, a professor of international trade at Cornell University.Yet requiring China to manage its currency and keep it above a certain level would be a striking shift from the policy of past administrations, which have tried to encourage China to let the value of its currency rise and fall with market forces.\u201cIt\u2019s a very odd way to approach this,\u201d Mr. Prasad said, \u201cto tell China, after having told them for all these years, \u2018Let your currency be determined by market forces,\u2019 to say, \u2018Let your currency be determined by market forces only if it is appreciating.\u2019\u201dThe final terms of the deal are likely to be worked out in a meeting or phone call between Mr. Xi and Mr. Trump himself. If so, Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s job this week will be to narrow the suite of disagreements down to just a handful of remaining issues for the president to negotiate."}, {"title": "Huawei Is Expanding in Canada, Despite U.S. Pressure", "category": "Business", "id": "9547eb15-f95f-4d4d-9cca-62648aacb267", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/huawei-canada-expansion.html", "publishdate": 20190221, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/22/business/22huawei2/merlin_149923800_5bba3844-664f-4bbe-b9ab-b71ecfc25776-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Huawei, the Chinese technology company accused by the authorities in the United States of posing a security risk, is expanding its operations in Canada.Huawei said on Thursday that it would hire 200 new employees in Canada \u2014 an increase of about 20 percent to the company\u2019s work force in the country. The new hires are part of an expansion of Huawei\u2019s research and development efforts as it works to secure a place in the development of Canada\u2019s 5G wireless networks.Huawei, one of the largest telecommunications technology makers in the world, is fighting to maintain its position under increasing pressure from the United States.

She is currently free on bail in Vancouver.\u201cI cannot say the U.S. charges against Ms. Meng are not politically driven,\u201d Mr. Liang said on Thursday. \u201cI believe she is innocent, and I hope that the Canadian legal system could bring justice back to her.\u201d"}, {"title": "Google Ends Forced Arbitration for All Employee Disputes", "category": "Business", "id": "4337cada-1438-4ed8-858c-525c10e0ccd2", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/google-forced-arbitration.html", "publishdate": 20190221, "imageurl": "", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google said it would no longer force employees to settle disputes with the company in private arbitration, expanding on an earlier pledge to do away with the practice in cases of sexual harassment or assault.Google informed its staff in an email on Thursday that the new policy would take effect globally on March 21 for current and future employees. Gina Scigliano, a Google spokeswoman, confirmed the changes.In November, the company agreed to scrap forced arbitration in individual cases of sexual harassment or assault after 20,000 Google workers staged a walkout demanding changes to how it treats employees.

She may finally be making some headway, though she still needs to convince lawmakers of any changes to her plan.She made her case to the E.U. In discussions with the European Commission\u2019s president, Jean-Claude Juncker, she pressed for \u201clegally binding changes\u201d to her existing deal that she hopes will make it palatable to British lawmakers. Britain\u2019s attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, and Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, are expected to propose wordings for those legal tweaks today.Some progress may have been made. \u201cA Brexit agreement is already being hammered out in Brussels, according to Spain\u2019s foreign minister, as the bloc seeks reassuring language that can convince British members of Parliament to back the deal,\u201d Bloomberg explains.But the E.U. may demand that any changes are first approved in Britain. The E.U. \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to call leaders for a summit to sign off on changes that are then rejected by the U.K. Parliament,\u201d Bloomberg reports, adding that \u201conce there\u2019s an agreement, it should be tested in Parliament, and only after that will leaders be asked to sign off on it at a summit.\u201d And it is far from clear that lawmakers would approve.More Brexit news: Nine more Conservative party lawmakers have reportedly said that they could resign from the party in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Ms. Harris later affirmed that support in a statement to The New York Times.\u201cWe have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m serious about taking an approach that would change policies and structures and make real investments in black communities.\u201dMs. Warren also said she supported reparations for black Americans impacted by slavery \u2014 a policy that experts say could cost several trillion dollars, and one that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and many top Democrats have not supported.The Warren campaign declined to give further details on that backing, but it came amid her calls for the federal government to provide special home-buying assistance to residents of communities that were adversely affected by \u201credlining,\u201d the discriminatory practice of denying mortgages, usually in poor and nonwhite areas. She also announced a sweeping universal child-care proposal that could strongly benefit minority communities that often have limited early childhood services.The morally driven policy goals of Ms. Harris and Ms. Warren reflect a broader shift in the importance of race and identity issues in the Democratic Party, according to several scholars and political leaders who focus on the intersection of race and politics. While Democrats have long cast themselves as more inclusive than the Republican Party, grass-roots organizers and many liberal voters of all races are now pushing elected officials to go further on policies of racial equality, regardless of any political calculations.ImageSenator Elizabeth Warren spoke in Las Vegas on Sunday. Ms. Warren said that she also supported reparations for black Americans impacted by slavery.CreditBridget Bennett for The New York TimesBut race-conscious policies could emerge as a fissure in a wide-open Democratic primary, as some moderate candidates seek to run against the party\u2019s recent leftward lurch. There are also political risks for the general election: Republicans have long attempted to paint Democrats who embrace policies that address racial inequalities as anti-white, and polling often shows reparations for black Americans remains an unpopular policy across the country.That two leading Democratic candidates have embraced reparations \u2014 the concept that the federal government should both acknowledge the ongoing legacy of slavery and discrimination and provide compensatory payment to those affected \u2014 is a major shift from past presidential campaigns and a win for activists who have tried to push the issue into the mainstream for decades. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former cabinet secretary who is also running for president, has also indicated that he would support reparations.Even among the 2020 Democrats who stopped short of endorsing reparations, several have laid out robust policies aimed at closing the gap in wealth between black and white families. Scholars estimate that black families in America today earn just $57.30 for every $100 in income earned by white families, according to the Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey. For every $100 in white family wealth, black families hold just $5.04.Senator Cory Booker\u2019s \u201cbaby bonds\u201d policy aims to help poorer children by giving them a government-funded savings account that could total up to $50,000 for the lowest income brackets. The plan has been praised by liberal scholars, who think it could go a long way in helping lower-income Americans begin to build wealth. And Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has endorsed a proposal to allow Americans without checking accounts to bank at the local post office; a disproportionate percentage of America\u2019s unbanked population are people of color.Mar\u00eda Urbina, national policy director for the progressive group Indivisible, said that after years of being pushed by activists, the Democratic Party was getting closer to applying its liberal values to racial equality. Policies like reparations or \u201cbaby bonds\u201d that seek to close the racial wealth gap, she said, should be viewed similarly to idealistic programs that have been embraced by Democrats seeking the presidential nomination, including the Green New Deal and \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d\u201cWe want folks who are being ambitious, not just working within the margins and the contours of what we had before, but sort of reimagining things on our own terms and being really aspirational,\u201d Ms. Urbina said.Sandy Darity, a Duke University professor who is a leading scholar on reparations and the racial wealth gap, said he believes more black Americans may come to see reparations as a defining issue for their support.\u201cThere is a point in black Americans making a collective decision to treat a candidate\u2019s attitude toward reparations as a litmus test for supporting them,\u201d Dr. Darity said. \u201cI think if folks had paid closer attention to the fact that Barack Obama was against reparations, they would have not been as disappointed by his presidency, because they would have had more realistic expectations about what he was likely to do.\u201dAmong Democrats, the idea of reparations has been unpopular until very recently. For more than two decades, Representative John Conyers, the Detroit Democratic stalwart who resigned in December 2017, repeatedly introduced a reparations bill to Congress that received little support from either party.Mr. Sanders, the Vermont leftist whose rhetoric of a political revolution won him throngs of supporters in the last Democratic primary and disrupted the party establishment, dismissed the idea of reparations as politically unpalatable in January 2016, upsetting some racial justice activists who found his answer hypocritical. Mrs. Clinton, who beat Mr. Sanders for the 2016 nomination, also declined to support reparations.Mr. Obama, the country\u2019s first black president, was seen in some political quarters as reticent about prioritizing the interests of black voters, and he called the idea of reparations impractical in 2016.\u201cI\u2019m not so optimistic as to think that you would ever be able to garner a majority of an American Congress that would make those kinds of investments, above and beyond the kinds of investments that could be made in a progressive program for lifting up all people,\u201d Mr. Obama said.As Ms. Warren and Ms. Harris seek to lead the party into a new era, their support for the policy \u2014 which did not come with specifics \u2014 signals just how quickly prominent Democrats have expanded their political imagination after decades of dominance by the Clintons and Mr. Obama.Ms. Warren, in particular, has attempted to stake out more aggressive policies to push other Democrats in the race. Her proposal for universal child care would make the service free to any family earning up to double the federal poverty level, and would increase wages for child care workers \u2014 two initiatives that could particularly affect black and Latino communities, where informal child-care arrangements are more common.\u201cWe must confront the dark history of slavery and government-sanctioned discrimination in this country that has had many consequences, including undermining the ability of black families to build wealth in America for generations,\u201d Ms. Warren told The Times. \u201cWe need systemic, structural changes to address that.\u201dAnother sign of the party\u2019s shift on race: Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Democrat whose bold policy ideas and devoted national following have upended Capitol Hill, also voiced her support for reparations earlier this month.\u201cUntil America tells the truth about itself, we\u2019re not going to heal,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said at a forum with Ta-Nehisi Coates, the writer whose landmark 2014 article, \u201cThe Case For Reparations,\u201d helped thrust the issue back into American consciousness.ImageSenator Cory Booker in Rochester, N.H., on Sunday.

Instead, several laid out policies that, though not intended as a redress for slavery, would benefit black Americans.Mr. Booker \u201cis running for president to reignite our sense of common purpose to build a more fair and just nation \u2014 that means enacting policies that atone for this nation\u2019s history of intentionally discriminatory public policy toward African-Americans,\u201d said Michael Tyler, a spokesman for his campaign. \u201cYou cannot address the systemic racism unique to this country without proposing race-conscious solutions.\u201dDarrick Hamilton, a professor at Ohio State University who has worked with Dr. Darity on research regarding inequality, said Mr. Booker\u2019s \u201cbaby bonds\u201d plan could substantially transform wealth building measures for poor Americans and minorities and could help minorities grow assets.Dr. Hamilton and Dr. Darity both panned Ms. Harris\u2019s signature economic proposals, which would dramatically expand a tax credit for middle-class families and provide rent relief to those struggling to afford rising home costs. Both proposals are \u201cincome-based,\u201d the professors said, and would do little to stem wealth inequality between races.Only one 2020 candidate has laid out a reparations plan with specifics: Marianne Williamson, the best-selling author and self-described \u201cspiritual teacher.\u201d Since the start of her long-shot campaign, Ms. Williamson has called for $100 billion in reparations for black Americans \u2014 far more than any other Democrat, but substantially less than what scholars have said would be necessary.\u201cPaltry,\u201d Dr. Darity said of Ms. Williamson\u2019s plan."}, {"title": "The Auto Show of the Future Is Already Here", "category": "Business", "id": "31296a2b-d370-454e-b0bc-ed0bf8aaaf2d", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/auto-shows-detroit-los-angeles-future.html", "publishdate": 20190221, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/22/business/22wheels1/merlin_149238672_c59a1cf0-b685-4ce8-95ba-7a4fcac51906-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Despite all he had seen in nearly three decades as executive director of Detroit\u2019s annual auto show, Rod Alberts found himself staring in mild disbelief.On a nearby video screen, he watched as an empty autonomous car parked itself, used a sensor to recharge its batteries through thin air, then returned to curbside to pick up its \u201coccupants.\u201dAlthough controlled from the event\u2019s lower ground floor in Detroit, the vehicle itself was over 7,000 miles away, in Shanghai. Captured in real time by three cameras, the demonstration used an \u201cautomated valet\u201d system developed by ZongMu Technology, a Chinese start-up.Increasingly, alongside their traditional sparkling new models on rotating stands, top car shows are mixing in heavy doses of technology and hands-on experiences like driving simulators and virtual reality demonstrations.\u201cTechnology is here to stay,\u201d Mr. Alberts said, noting the scores of start-ups at the North American International Auto Show last month in Detroit. \u201cThe mobility world, and our car shows, have changed a lot.\u201d[Carmakers no longer see auto shows as can\u2019t-miss events.]Ten years ago, Mr. Alberts estimates, the worldwide car population spanned 50 brands and 350 models. Today, with the disappearance of names like Saab, Scion, Mercury and Pontiac, and automakers like General Motors and Ford still trimming their lineups, he calculates those numbers have shrunk by as much as 20 percent.All this means fewer cars on Mr. Alberts\u2019 carpets. Moreover, as carmakers increasingly take advantage of social media and shorter build times, model introductions that historically took place in the fall and winter \u2014 when many shows are scheduled \u2014 now happen year-round.However, despite recent headlines proclaiming the imminent demise of conventional car shows, those predictions seem premature.ImageA virtual test drive at the Detroit show. An estimated 11 million people attended the nation\u2019s 55 traditional car shows last year.CreditScott Olson/Getty ImagesThe biggest events still draw large crowds, filled with plenty of potential buyers. Last year, an estimated 11 million people attended the nation\u2019s 55 traditional car shows \u2014 excluding classic auto and specialty exhibits \u2014 according to Foresight Research, an industry data-tracking firm in Rochester Hills, Mich. Despite record-breaking cold weather, the Detroit show\u2019s attendance reached a reported 774,000, off slightly from the year before but hardly dying.\u201cIt\u2019s true the shows are evolving \u2014 but in a positive way,\u201d said Jennifer Colman, president of the Automotive Trade Association Executives. \u201cThey\u2019re offering interactive apps, ride-and-drives and other experiences that meet consumers\u2019 needs.\u201dTwo years ago, the Detroit show teamed up with PlanetM, an initiative sponsored by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation that fosters emerging \u201cmobility\u201d technologies. This year, including ZongMu in China, 149 tech and start-up companies populated the Detroit show\u2019s lower ground floor, in a showcase for potential investors. Among them:BEDESTRIAN This start-up from Ann Arbor, Mich., plans to deploy autonomous robotic vehicles for \u201clast mile\u201d deliveries in congested urban areas. The company hopes to find a niche among elderly, disabled and veteran populations.DERQ Based in Detroit and Dubai, this start-up is focusing on preventing vehicle and pedestrian intersection accidents before they happen. Its technology links \u201csmart city\u201d cameras and sensors to patented predictive algorithms that trigger audio and visual alarms in standard and autonomous vehicles.SEEVA TECHNOLOGIES Seeva, a father-daughter start-up in Seattle, uses targeted streams of a vehicle\u2019s heated washer fluid to clean windshields, cameras and sensors on self-driving and standard vehicles. Fully autonomous cars are expected to deploy dozens of such detectors, says Diane Lansinger, the chief executive.\u201cIt\u2019s a chance to expose new companies and technologies to potential investors and the traditional automotive world,\u201d Trevor Pawl, PlanetM group vice president, said of the Detroit show. \u201cAnd we get to do that here, where the industry began.\u201dTwo months earlier, a similar transformation was apparent at AutoMobility LA, the big annual Los Angeles auto show.As in Detroit, dozens of new car models were unveiled, and to great hoopla. But since 2016, when the Los Angeles show\u2019s owners merged with Connected Car Expo, much had changed. The November event became one of the first to address the converging worlds of technology and automaking and to offer public forums for the discussion of knotty issues facing transportation.For one thing, there was the show\u2019s serious-sounding \u201cFuture of Human Driving\u201d theme. Panelists wrestled with deep-think topics like \u201cThe New Demands of Car Design,\u201d \u201cFuture Mobility and the Reimagined Car\u201d and \u201cPreparing Highways for the Autonomous Future.\u201dImageThe Philadelphia Auto Show this month. \u201cWhen I look out and see 70,000 people on our floor on a Saturday afternoon,\u201d its director said, \u201cthere\u2019s no question in my mind of the continuing importance of car shows.\u201dCreditJose F. Moreno/The Philadelphia Inquirer, via Associated Press\u201cThis was the first time I\u2019ve felt the kind of excitement you get at the Paris and Detroit shows,\u201d said Kimberly Marte, a member of the design panel.\u201cWe\u2019re in a time of change in how we look at the whole future of transportation,\u201d added Ms. Marte, a lecturer at the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, Calif. \u201cThe L.A. show reflected that, and it gave the event a lot of weight.\u201dMs. Marte singled out the show\u2019s introduction of a water-wading electric pickup truck with a range of 400 miles. Made by Rivian, from Plymouth, Mich., the truck was billed as the first in a line of \u201celectric adventure\u201d vehicles.[Amazon has invested in Rivian, a potential rival to Tesla.]\u201cIt was a different kind of buzz,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody was talking about it, surrounding that truck.\u201dNotably, the Los Angeles show was bracketed by two portentous announcements from the world\u2019s largest automaker: Volkswagen will end production of its iconic Beetle this year, and it intends to cease gasoline and diesel engine development after 2026.Even so, as Ms. Colman and others insist, car shows remain very much alive and kicking.Steve Bruyn, Foresight\u2019s chief executive, said the number of car-shopping attendees had recently grown, a gain he attributed to greater interest by millennials.\u201cThe 18-34 age cohort has increased dramatically since 2015,\u201d Mr. Bruyn said, and is now the largest single demographic among attendees who subsequently buy a vehicle.\u201cIf anything, because of millennials, auto shows have increased in importance in terms of shopping,\u201d he said. \u201cThese folks often don\u2019t have prior experience or brand loyalty, so for them attending the show takes on added meaning.\u201dSince 1998, Kevin Mazzucola has been the executive director of the Philadelphia Auto Show, a more localized exhibit, held this month, that seasons its shiny metal with football cheerleaders and live radio broadcasts.Image\u201cTechnology is here to stay,\u201d said Rod Alberts, the longtime executive director of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.CreditBrendan McDermid/Reuters\u201cWhen I look out and see 70,000 people on our floor on a Saturday afternoon,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s no question in my mind of the continuing importance of car shows.\u201d\u201cConsumers revel in comparison shopping,\u201d he added. \u201cWe give them a chance to see if that new S.U.V.\u2019s third row of seats is really big enough to haul the kids to a soccer game.\u201dDespite his optimism, Mr. Mazzucola perceives a growing need for the shows to educate consumers, especially as the industry moves toward self-driving vehicles.\u201cPolls show the public is apprehensive about autonomous cars,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need help from manufacturers to alleviate those fears, to use our shows to educate and expose consumers to new technology.\u201dThat effort may get a boost next year, when the Detroit show shifts its schedule to June from its traditional January run. \u201cWe\u2019re going to break the mold,\u201d Mr. Alberts said.The more temperate weather will allow the show to add 14 acres of outside space and take full advantage of the city\u2019s revitalized riverfront and surrounding streets.\u201cWe\u2019ll have sun until 9 p.m.,\u201d said Mr. Alberts, who predicts a galalike atmosphere comparable to the Goodwood Festival of Speed in England. The new show will be a hub for automotive technology, he said, one that offers consumers plenty of room for \u201cexperiential engagement.\u201dAt least one of the Detroit show\u2019s start-ups will welcome the change.\u201cWe\u2019ve got six products in development,\u201d Ms. Lansinger of Seeva said, \u201cso the show is definitely worth our time. But sometimes when I walk through the main floor I feel like I\u2019m in a history museum.\u201dDoubtless reflecting the views of other technology companies, she hopes better weather will mean a chance to move upstairs, with the marquee displays."}, {"title": "Pinterest Is Said to File for I.P.O.", "category": "Business", "id": "2a2043d1-ba06-47ee-bf18-ab060052dee4", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/pinterest-ipo-public-markets.html", "publishdate": 20190221, "imageurl": "", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Pinterest confidentially filed paperwork to go public, according to two people familiar with the decision, joining a stampede of high-profile start-ups heading toward the public markets. The company, which has an app and a website that allow people to save images and links to virtual pin boards, filed its paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission in early February, the people said. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the filing publicly.Private market investors have valued Pinterest at $12 billion. In September, it was expected to top $700 million in revenue last year, a 50 percent increase from 2017. At the time, it had 250 million monthly active users.Mike Mayzel, a Pinterest spokesman, declined to comment.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Pinterest had filed the paperwork with regulators. The stampede of initial public offerings by highly valued Silicon Valley companies has intensified in recent weeks. Lyft is preparing to begin trading its shares in late April. Its ride-hailing rival, Uber, which filed its initial paperwork with the S.E.C. last year, is expected to follow. Investment bankers have estimated that Uber could be worth $120 billion on the public market. Slack, an office messaging app company, has also filed to go public. The company was last valued at $7.1 billion by private investors. Postmates, a food delivery app worth nearly $2 billion, has also filed confidential paperwork to go public. Pinterest has plenty of cash: It raised around $1.5 billion in venture capital funding and has come close to profitability in the past. But it is unclear how investors will view the company, which makes money from online advertising and competes against Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter and Snap for market share.The company is unusual in Silicon Valley for its avoidance of hype and media coverage. That reluctance has frustrated some investors and executives, leading to executive turnover in recent years. But others view Pinterest\u2019s reserved, slow and steady approach as the reason for its success. In contrast to its social media peers like Facebook and Twitter, Pinterest has taken bold steps to eradicate potentially harmful disinformation from its platform. The company recently removed search results for content related to vaccines to prevent false anti-vaccination memes and information from spreading.Ben Silbermann, Evan Sharp and Paul Sciarra founded Pinterest in 2010. The company\u2019s growth took off soon after, particularly among Midwestern women. In recent years, user growth had slowed, but Mr. Silbermann, the chief executive, resisted Silicon Valley\u2019s typical tricks for juicing the numbers in the short term, favoring what he called \u201cquality growth.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a natural rate at which you can scale a company that\u2019s healthy,\u201d he told The New York Times last year.A year ago, the company hired Francoise Brougher as its chief operating officer, a move that many people in the industry saw as a sign that Pinterest would soon tap the public markets. Ms. Brougher helped take Square, the payments company, public in 2015. In November, in a sign that it wanted to promote itself more than it had in the past, the company hired Andr\u00e9a Mallard, formerly a marketer at Gap Inc.\u2019s Athleta brand, as its chief marketing officer.Some of the companies from this generation of start-ups plan to do nontraditional public offerings called direct listings.In a direct listing, companies do not go on I.P.O. \u201croad shows\u201d to pitch their stock to potential investors, nor do they issue new shares or arrange stock sales in advance of the listing. This avoids lockup periods when a stock first goes on the market. During that period, insiders cannot sell their stock. The option is attractive for companies that have no need to tap the public markets for more money. It has piqued the interest of highly valued start-ups that have raised billions from private market investors.Spotify, the music streaming company, had a successful direct listing last year. Slack plans to follow in its footsteps with a similar transaction in the coming months.But Pinterest plans to pursue a traditional I.P.O., one of the people familiar with the situation said."}, {"title": "Consumer Groups Accuse Facebook of Duping Children", "category": "Business", "id": "e088652e-c63c-4071-ba7a-9e48e50b89de", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/facebook-children-privacy.html", "publishdate": 20190221, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/22/business/22ftc-print/merlin_78242836_6bb75187-02b9-41e1-b853-6d3fd094a55f-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 More than a dozen children\u2019s advocacy groups on Thursday accused Facebook of knowingly deceiving children into racking up fees from games on its social network, the latest in a string of complaints against the company sent to federal regulators.The groups called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Facebook violated consumer protection and child privacy laws by duping children into making in-app purchases in games like Angry Birds, PetVille and Ninja Saga, and then making it nearly impossible for children or their parents to seek refunds. The accusation stems from a 2012 lawsuit.The complaint, filed by 17 groups including Common Sense Media, Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood and the Center for Digital Democracy, says the purchases were often done without a parent\u2019s permission. In some cases, they amounted to hundreds or thousands of dollars.\u201cFacebook\u2019s exploitative practices targeted a population universally recognized as vulnerable \u2014 young people,\u201d the groups said in the complaint.In Washington\u2019s greater focus on the power of Big Tech, Facebook has taken center stage. The social network\u2019s role in state-sponsored election interference, harmful content and privacy violations has set off a push for new privacy laws and multiple investigations of the company. Next week, Congress will debate proposals for a federal privacy law.The F.T.C. started investigating Facebook in March after The New York Times reported that the data of tens of millions of Facebook users was unknowingly shared with the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The agency is in the final stages of that investigation, with staff members and Facebook negotiating over a potential settlement that could include a multibillion-dollar fine and new restraints on the company\u2019s business practices, according to people familiar with the talks.The consumer groups do not believe the complaint will be included in the F.T.C.\u2019s privacy investigation of Facebook because that case appears to be nearing its completion.But the children\u2019s advocacy groups said they hoped their complaint would continue a drumbeat of pressure for Facebook to take more forceful steps to change its business practices oriented toward children.\u201cThis is a pattern of behavior,\u201d said James Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media. \u201cFacebook has a moral obligation to change its culture towards practices that foster the well-being of kids and families, and the F.T.C. should ensure Facebook is acting responsibly.\u201dIn a statement, Facebook said that in 2016 it had updated some of its policies governing purchases by minors.\u201cWe have in place mechanisms to prevent fraud at the time of purchase, and we offer people the option to dispute purchases and seek refunds,\u201d the statement said. \u201cAs part of our long history of working with parents and experts to offer tools for families navigating Facebook and the web, Facebook also has safeguards in place regarding minors\u2019 purchases.\u201dThe F.T.C. declined to comment.Details about the in-app purchases came from court documents that were unsealed at the request of the Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit journalism organization. The documents were part of a class-action lawsuit brought in 2012 and settled in 2016 for an undisclosed sum.The 135 pages of unsealed documents included internal corporate memos and emails in which Facebook employees encouraged game developers to create features that would get children to make credit card charges while playing games. In many cases, the children did not realize that their parents\u2019 credit cards were attached to the games or that they were spending real money, the consumer groups argued in their complaint.The F.T.C. polices consumer fraud, deception and unfair practices and is well versed in the issue of in-app purchases \u2014 the charges made within an app and directly charged through iTunes or Google Play stores, for example.In 2013, the agency started an investigation into major charges by children using in-app purchases for things like \u201cgold coins\u201d in smartphone games. The F.T.C. reached a $32.5 million settlement with Apple and a $19 million settlement with Google over accusations that children were deceived into making such purchases and that the companies did not properly disclose to parents that they were being charged for their children\u2019s purchases."}, {"title": "The Week in Tech: Chinese and Iranian Hackers Have Returned", "category": "Business", "id": "7c84bc82-1e1d-4848-9907-7b3dba04fc21", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/technology/china-iran-hackers.html", "publishdate": 20190222, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/25/business/25subtechnewsletter-print/merlin_148356612_313f249f-3bdf-49f6-88e3-1adadfd91467-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Hello, dear readers! I\u2019m Nicole Perlroth, cybersecurity reporter here at The Times. I\u2019m afraid the week\u2019s news isn\u2019t all unicorns and rainbows.This should come as a shock to no one, but President Trump\u2019s confrontational diplomacy has energized state hackers in Iran and China. They are targeting companies and government agencies in the United States with renewed gusto, after a multiyear lull. The rebound in activity comes on top of the continuing threat from Russians, who have already started hacking European civil society groups before elections there in May.Consider this a preview of 2020.With the United States pulling out of the nuclear deal with Iran, Iranian hackers are hitting American banks, businesses and federal agencies with cyberattacks. They\u2019ve significantly stepped up their game: harder to track down and more effective.We\u2019re no longer talking so-called denial-of-service attacks that make websites hiccup. They\u2019re exploiting weaknesses in the internet\u2019s backbone to steal web traffic as it passes between government agencies, banks and businesses that manage their back-end infrastructure.The attacks rattled Homeland Security officials, who triggered an emergency alert during the government shutdown last month. Security researchers say that the attacks have not relented and that they\u2019re hitting American targets with an unnerving success rate.The news out of China is even more troubling. Mr. Trump\u2019s trade confrontations with Beijing have energized state hackers in Beijing, who have renewed attacks on American businesses, especially in high-tech and defense companies.Chinese industrial espionage notably dropped after President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China reached a 2015 deal to cease cybertheft of trade secrets. Now, the gloves are off.Miriam Wugmeister, a cybersecurity specialist at the law firm Morrison Foerster, told me that Fortune 500 companies were being hit at \u201cshockingly high\u201d rates.It\u2019s rare that victims step forward \u2014 state laws require companies to disclose breaches only if personal data is compromised \u2014 but T-Mobile, Boeing and General Electric Aviation are among the companies in the crossfire.If that\u2019s not worrying you, consider my colleague Sui-Lee Wee\u2019s blockbuster report Thursday on China\u2019s campaign to build a DNA database, in part to track and suppress China\u2019s minority Uighur population. Beijing could not have pulled this off without a big helping hand from Thermo Fisher, a Massachusetts equipment maker, and genetic material provided by a prominent Yale University researcher who says he was unaware the material was used as a surveillance tool.In other news:\u25a0 Lyft is racing to beat Uber to an initial public offering, my colleagues Mike Isaac and Kate Conger reported. Lyft is hoping to debut on the Nasdaq at a $20 billion to $25 billion valuation before it\u2019s overshadowed by its bigger ride-hailing competitor, Uber, which bankers initially pegged at a $120 billion valuation.\u25a0 Google is losing advertisers after a YouTuber posted video showing the prevalence of pedophiles who comment on videos of children doing regular activities like gymnastics or stretching. My colleagues Dai Wakabayashi and Sapna Maheshwari reported that major brands like Nestl\u00e9 and Epic Games have pulled advertising after users flagged their ads on children\u2019s videos targeted by pedophiles.YouTube and other big tech companies are already under fire for failing to aggressively police their platforms. Last month, YouTube said it had tweaked its algorithm to stop recommending conspiracy theories to users. This past week, my colleague Kevin Roose wrote a terrific piece outlining one of the central challenges for the company: Some of YouTube\u2019s biggest stars (and ad magnets) push conspiracies.Google is hardly the only company struggling with misinformation. This month, The Guardian discovered that YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithms and Facebook\u2019s search results were still steering viewers from fact-based medical information to anti-vaccine misinformation. All this as the Pacific Northwest is still reeling from an emergency measles outbreak.\u25a0 Karl Lagerfeld, the fashion icon, died in Paris on Tuesday. True to form, no obituary had an accurate read on his age, though The Times noted he was \u201cgenerally thought to be 85.\u201dA tech newsletter this depressing would not be complete without my favorite Lagerfeld quote: \u201cSweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control of your life, so you bought some sweatpants.\u201d (Thank God Karl Lagerfeld never set foot in Silicon Valley.)Nicole Perlroth writes about cybersecurity in the Times\u2019s San Francisco bureau.

It also reported disappointing fourth quarter earnings that led some analysts to ask whether the company\u2019s stringent controls on costs might be backfiring.The company\u2019s stock was down almost 27 percent as trading began on Friday.Kraft\u2019s chief executive, Bernardo Hees, said the company\u2019s earnings fell short because it did not deliver sufficient cost savings.\u201cFor that, we take full responsibility,\u201d he said Thursday on a call with investors and analysts.The huge write-down appeared to come from a shift in how consumers eat, emphasizing fresh food over processed products. The write-down reduced the value on the balance sheet of United States and Canadian operations and the Kraft and Oscar Mayer trademarks, the company said.Kraft and Heinz, two stalwarts of grocery store aisles, merged in 2015 in a deal that combined the investments of 3G Capital, a Brazilian private investment group, and Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway. Together, the two investment firms owned nearly half of Kraft Heinz at the end of last year. Mr. Buffett stepped down from the company\u2019s board last year.But the company has struggled with both the changing tastes of shoppers and with cutting costs. On that latter issue, the S.E.C.\u2019s scrutiny could add to investor concerns.Kraft Heinz said that the regulator looked at \u201cagreements, side agreements, and changes or modifications to its agreements with its vendors.\u201d With external accounting and legal advisers, Kraft carried out an investigation that led to it recording a $25 million increase in costs in the fourth quarter. The company said it should have recorded the $25 million in earlier periods.Kraft\u2019s chief financial officer, David H. Knopf, said on the investor call that the misstatement \u201cwas not material to our current and prior year financial statements.\u201dKraft said it would make changes to reduce the chances of making similar accounting missteps in the future, adding that it was continuing to cooperate with the commission.3G Capital is well known for pursuing lower costs at the companies it owns. One analyst on Thursday pressed Mr. Hees on whether Kraft\u2019s belt-tightening had gone too far and was now damaging some of its most prominent brands.\u201cWe still believe strongly that our model is working and has a lot of potential for the future,\u201d Mr. Hees said."}, {"title": "Jussie Smollett Won\u2019t Be on Final Episodes of \u2018Empire\u2019 Season", "category": "Business", "id": "5f64ea97-6747-4666-90d8-6f7794410ba3", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/business/media/empire-jussie-smollett-fox.html", "publishdate": 20190222, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/23/arts/23fox-smollett/merlin_151052730_89515147-7ad1-43cd-8d3a-0caa37423b4f-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The producers of the Fox drama \u201cEmpire\u201d announced Friday that Jussie Smollett\u2019s character would not appear in the final two episodes of the show\u2019s fifth season. The announcement came a day after Chicago police arrested him and said he staged an attack against himself in a bid for publicity.Following his arrest and release on bail, Mr. Smollett had returned to the set of \u201cEmpire\u201d and started filming scenes as his character Jamal Lyon, raising questions of how Fox would handle his presence going forward.[Latest update \u2014 For Jussie Smollett, how a life of arts and activism is upended.]\u201cWhile these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out,\u201d the producers said in a statement. \u201cWe are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of \u2018Jamal\u2019 from the final two episodes of the season.\u201dMr. Smollett\u2019s arrest \u2014 and his recent loss of support from many public figures who spoke out in favor of him after the attack last month \u2014 put Fox in an extremely awkward position. [Read more about his arrest on Thursday.]There are two more episodes left to shoot over the next month for the show\u2019s fifth season. Fox has been a staunch supporter of Mr. Smollett\u2019s for weeks, releasing a statement as recently as Wednesday saying that he was the \u201cconsummate professional\u201d and denying he would be written out of the show. Likewise in their statement on Friday, the producers said, \u201cJussie has been an important member of our \u2018Empire\u2019 family for the past five years and we care about him deeply.\u201dBut with Mr. Smollett\u2019s arrest \u2014 and the Chicago police claiming they have key evidence to demonstrate he staged the attack \u2014 the \u201cEmpire\u201d set was on the verge of turning into a circus. After Mr. Smollett posted bail, he was trailed by news helicopters as he returned to the \u201cEmpire\u201d set. He did not return to the \u201cEmpire\u201d set on Friday.The move to cut him out of the final two episodes this season essentially buys Fox and producers of \u201cEmpire\u201d some time to decide what to ultimately do with his character.Fox has until mid-May to decide if it even wants to keep \u201cEmpire\u201d on the air, though there are reasons to do that. The show is its second-highest-rated drama and it has a shrinking but passionate fan base.VideoA Chicago police superintendent said Jussie Smollett, who was arrested on a charge of having filed a false police report, \u201ctook advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.\u201dCreditCreditAshlee Rezin/Chicago Sun-Times, via Associated PressIf the series is renewed, Fox has until the end of June to decide if it wants to pick up actors\u2019 contracts, which would include Mr. Smollett\u2019s. Filming would not begin again until later in July or August.There are several corporate changes that may determine Mr. Smollett\u2019s fate as well.In a matter of weeks, 20th Century Fox Television, the studio that produces \u201cEmpire,\u201d will be folded into The Walt Disney Company after Disney closes on its purchase of many of Fox\u2019s entertainment properties. Suddenly Disney\u2019s opinions of Mr. Smollett will become a vital part of the calculus.Likewise, the Fox broadcast network, which is not part of the sale and will still be owned by the Murdoch family, has a new set of leaders that will guide a different path for the network. It will be up to those leaders, led by the Fox Entertainment chief executive Charlie Collier, to decide whether they want \u201cEmpire\u201d on the air and if they want to include Mr. Smollett.Mr. Smollett plays Jamal Lyon, the gay scion of a hip-hop dynasty. The character is a fan favorite and Danny Strong, a producer for the show, tweeted as recently as a week ago that Mr. Smollett is the \u201cthird lead\u201d of the series. Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson are the stars of the show.\u201cEmpire\u201d was last on the air in December, and is scheduled to return to Fox\u2019s airwaves on March 13. This season has nine more episodes and Mr. Smollett will appear in most of them; seven of the nine episodes have already been shot.A big question for Fox\u2019s producers will be how Mr. Smollett is written off the final two episodes this season, and how they will approach his character if it\u2019s decided he should leave the show for good. When Jamal Lyon was last seen, he was fighting with his fianc\u00e9 who, in turn, was threatening to move to London. One solution for the show\u2019s creators could be to have Jamal join his fianc\u00e9 in Britain.Or perhaps the producers could go a more tried-and-true route.\u201cThe easiest way is that they write him to die or they languish him to the hospital for some time, hoping people will forget them,\u201d said Linda Seger, a veteran script consultant.The producers who announced that Mr. Smollett would be removed from the final two episodes this season include Lee Daniels, Mr. Strong, Brett Mahoney, Brian Grazer, Sanaa Hamri, Francie Calfo and Dennis Hammer.There is plenty of recent precedent of producers removing actors from TV series when real-life events force their hand. Charlie Sheen was fired from the CBS sitcom \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d in 2011 and replaced after several episodes of bizarre and bad behavior. Kevin Spacey was fired from \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d after he was accused of sexual misconduct in 2017. And ABC spun-off \u201cRoseanne\u201d into a new comedy, \u201cThe Conners,\u201d after Roseanne Barr posted a racist tweet last year."}, {"title": "U.S. Regulator Warns Japan\u2019s Biggest Bank Again on Money Laundering", "category": "Business", "id": "a289dc46-6e95-4ff2-9ad1-38035f7a1f83", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/business/mufg-bank-japan-money-laundering.html", "publishdate": 20190222, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/23/business/23MUFG-print/merlin_146925006_40d1ef05-a052-4cf8-94b7-f3ee867d918e-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Japan\u2019s largest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, was already being investigated by United States prosecutors over whether it had failed to detect money laundering and sanctions violations at its branches. On Friday, the bank got a fresh warning that it needed to address the issue, and quickly.A federal banking regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said it had uncovered serious problems at branches owned by MUFG Bank, the bank\u2019s name in the United States. The regulator said that the bank appeared to have broken anti-money laundering laws on more occasions than previously thought and that it must fix the problems immediately.The order was the latest in a series of reprimands for the bank, and the first from the agency that became its regulator when MUFG switched from being licensed by New York State to being federally licensed in November 2017.State regulators and other federal authorities have said for years that MUFG failed to properly monitor who its customers were and where their money came from. The problems were so severe that one former employee likened the bank\u2019s anti-money laundering program to \u201ca dumpster fire.\u201dDaniel Weidman, an MUFG spokesman, said the bank was \u201ctaking immediate corrective action,\u201d and he added that the regulator\u2019s order did not identify specific illegal transactions or sanctions violations.\u201cWe have made substantial investments over the last several years to bring us into full compliance,\u201d Mr. Weidman said. \u201cMUFG Bank is committed to conducting business with the highest levels of integrity, and to continually improving its regulatory compliance.\u201dRegulators in New York previously fined the bank hundreds of millions of dollars for similar violations. A spokesman for the Department of Financial Services, the state\u2019s banking regulator, had no immediate comment.The order by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on Friday did not come with fines. But an agency spokesman said it was one of several steps the regulator might take.\u201cThe process is often that a consent order is executed and penalties are assessed later,\u201d said the spokesman, Bryan Hubbard.The order was issued amid a fight between MUFG and the New York regulator over the bank\u2019s decision to leave New York\u2019s jurisdiction and be overseen by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency instead.MUFG has said the move was dictated by practical business considerations, but the state accused it of trying to evade oversight by choosing a less-rigorous regulator.Joseph Otting, the current comptroller of the currency, joined the agency in 2017 after having worked at MUFG in the past. The agency has said Mr. Otting was not involved in granting MUFG a national banking license.Just after switching regulators, MUFG sued New York in an effort to keep state officials from arguing that they still had a right to monitor the bank. Several months later, federal prosecutors in Manhattan began examining whether MUFG had lied to New York officials about its anti-money laundering programs.The new order from the currency comptroller\u2019s office suggests the bank should not expect a lighter touch from its new overseers. The agency said it had found things the New York regulator missed.Douglas Landy, a partner in the banking practice at the law firm Milbank who focuses on regulation and who is not involved in the matter, said that a step like the one the regulator took Friday could be the starting point for negotiations over the size of a potential fine.\u201cThe O.C.C. can dangle in front of them: Fix it fast and your fine will be less,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to explicitly say that, but that will be implied.\u201d"}, {"title": "How Amy Klobuchar Treats Her Staff", "category": "Politics", "id": "9a456069-4bf9-4f17-8bbe-843715b163b6", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/us/politics/amy-klobuchar-staff.html", "publishdate": 20190222, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/23/us/politics/23klobuchar-print/00klobuchar1-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "content": "Senator Amy Klobuchar was hungry, forkless and losing patience.An aide, joining her on a trip to South Carolina in 2008, had procured a salad for his boss while hauling their bags through an airport terminal. But once onboard, he delivered the grim news: He had fumbled the plastic eating utensils before reaching the gate, and the crew did not have any forks on such a short flight.What happened next was typical: Ms. Klobuchar berated her aide instantly for the slip-up. What happened after that was not: She pulled a comb from her bag and began eating the salad with it, according to four people familiar with the episode.Then she handed the comb to her staff member with a directive: Clean it.[Read more: Amy Klobuchar enters 2020 presidential race.]The moment \u2014 an abridged version of which Ms. Klobuchar recounted herself in a speech to fellow Democrats at the time \u2014 encapsulates the underside of life on the Minnesota senator\u2019s team, detailed in interviews with more than two dozen former staff members and internal emails reviewed by The New York Times. As Ms. Klobuchar joins the 2020 presidential race, many of these former aides say she was not just demanding but often dehumanizing \u2014 not merely a tough boss in a capital full of them but the steward of a work environment colored by volatility, highhandedness and distrust.The senator feared sabotage from her own team: In an email, she once raised the prospect of an in-house mole. She and her top confidantes could complicate the future job opportunities of some staff members who sought to leave, former aides said, sometimes speaking to their would-be employers to register her displeasure. And Ms. Klobuchar frequently suggested that her aides were preventing her from greater standing in Washington and beyond, former staff members said.\u201cWe are becoming a joke,\u201d she wrote in one email about the contents of her Twitter feed, \u201cand it is making me a joke.\u201dQuestions about Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s actions toward subordinates have shadowed the early days of her 2020 presidential campaign, with articles in HuffPost and BuzzFeed News by turns fueling the hard-driving reputation that has followed her for years in Washington and angering supporters who see sexism in the criticism.Ms. Klobuchar, 58, has allowed that she has \u201chigh expectations.\u201d\u201cAm I a tough boss sometimes? Yes,\u201d she said at a recent CNN forum. \u201cHave I pushed people too hard? Yes.\u201dPresented with a detailed accounting of The Times\u2019 reporting and the staff emails written by Ms. Klobuchar, a campaign spokeswoman, Carlie Waibel, said: \u201cThe senator has repeatedly acknowledged that she can be tough and push people hard. But these anonymous stories \u2014 some of which are just plain ridiculous \u2014 do not overshadow the countless experiences of people on the senator\u2019s team who she has been so proud to work with.\u201dVideoSenator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, is running for president. Ms. Klobuchar is hoping her Midwestern roots and history of working across the aisle will help her candidacy.CreditCreditJenn Ackerman for The New York Times[Our Politics editor, Patrick Healy, will be responding to readers\u2019 questions and feedback on our coverage of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Please leave your questions for him in the comments section.]Despite employee turnover that perennially ranks near the highest in the Senate, Ms. Klobuchar has defenders among her former staff. She noted at the forum that some people had been with her for many years.Erikka Knuti, a former communications aide to the senator, described her experience as broadly positive and said Ms. Klobuchar could be contrite at times, remembering a gesture of regret from the senator once after she snapped at Ms. Knuti in an elevator in front of another lawmaker. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t O.K.,\u201d she recalled Ms. Klobuchar telling her. \u201cIt made me feel valued,\u201d Ms. Knuti said.While there was wide consensus in the interviews that women were often held to a different standard as bosses, former aides \u2014 female and male \u2014 said their concerns about Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s behavior should not be dismissed as gender bias. Many of the aides said they had worked for both men and women, for lawmakers both compassionate and unkind, without encountering anyone else like Ms. Klobuchar.The world of congressional staffs is one of long hours and low pay, with much of the work shouldered by twentysomething junior aides who are learning on the job. Some members of Congress are notorious for round-the-clock phone calls, late-night email and fierce attention to their own press coverage. Ms. Klobuchar is among them, but former aides said they were especially troubled by her willingness \u2014 in excess of other senators\u2019, they said \u2014 to embarrass staff members over minor missteps or with odd requests.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]Most of those interviewed for this article \u2014 describing memories that span from shortly after her election in 2006 to the much more recent past \u2014 discussed their time with Ms. Klobuchar on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the senator. These concerns were not idle, they said. Saving potentially damaging emails from Ms. Klobuchar became something of a last-day ritual, the aides said, in case they ever needed evidence of her conduct for their own reputational protection.She was known to throw office objects in frustration, including binders and phones, in the direction of aides, they said. Low-level employees were asked to perform duties they described as demeaning, like washing her dishes or other cleaning \u2014 a possible violation of Senate ethics rules, according to veterans of the chamber.Appraisals of perceived staff incompetence were delivered at all hours of the day and night:\u201cIn 20 years in politics I have never seen worse prep,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said in one email, displeased at how a political event had been handled.\u201cThis is the hands down worse thing you have ever given me,\u201d she wrote in another, questioning her team\u2019s grasp of policy as she rejected its \u201cslop.\u201d\u201cThis is the worst press staff I ever had,\u201d she announced once to employees, according to an aide present. This was effectively a rite of passage, the aide said: The senator had plainly said the same about both predecessors and successors in the office.ImageMs. Klobuchar has tried to present her campaign image as \u201cMinnesota nice,\u201d touting an affable Midwestern common sense.CreditTim Gruber for The New York TimesStill, while few contest that serving Ms. Klobuchar could be a challenge, other current and former aides spoke fondly of the experience, expressing pride over the national platform she has earned. The senator\u2019s defenders say her conduct must be viewed in the larger context of women in Washington, where male leaders with legendary tempers and famously exacting standards, like former President Bill Clinton, have long subsisted atop the political food chain.For Ms. Klobuchar, there is the added complication of tending to a campaign image premised on affable Midwestern common sense.\u201cThe \u2018Minnesota nice\u2019 thing is also kind of a double-edged sword,\u201d Ms. Knuti said. \u201cIn the Midwest you have to be outwardly nice and congenial. But these are tough people. Male senators yell quite a bit. But if a woman yells at you, it\u2019s like, \u2018I got yelled at by my mom.\u2019\u201dThis much is not in dispute: For years, Ms. Klobuchar has had among the highest rates of staff turnover in the Senate, according to a review of congressional offices from the website LegiStorm. Over much of her Senate career, no one outpaced Ms. Klobuchar on this score; in 2017, two freshman senators, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, surpassed her.The churn has produced a bit of a vicious circle. Democrats in Washington say she has struggled to recruit and retain top talent. Some operatives say they have shied away from her 2020 campaign, mindful of Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s reputation.Among other concerns, her office\u2019s paid parental leave policy has been described as unusual on Capitol Hill. Two people familiar with the policy said that those who took paid leave were effectively required, once they returned, to remain with the office for three times as many weeks as they had been gone. The policy, outlined in an employee handbook, called for those who left anyway to pay back money earned during the weeks they were on leave.After receiving questions about the policy from The Times, Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s office said it would be revised. \u201cWe offer 12 weeks of paid maternity and paternity leave for our staff and have one of the strongest paid leave policies in the Senate,\u201d said a spokeswoman, Elana Ross. \u201cWe\u2019ve never made staff pay back any of their leave and will be changing that language in the handbook.\u201d She declined to provide a copy of the current policy as written.Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s supporters say the office environment has never adversely affected her work, cheering her status as a bipartisan pragmatist with a solidly Democratic record and political instincts more moderate than many of her 2020 peers\u2019. They cite her status as a legislative advocate for major national causes like lower prescription drug prices and more local issues like swimming pool safety after a tragic accident in Minnesota.The senator can also be charming, funny and warm, they say \u2014 a fixture at staff weddings and birthday parties. Jonathan Becker, her former chief of staff, said that while Ms. Klobuchar could be tough, the intensity was \u201cexhilarating, too,\u201d compelling aides to raise their performance.\u201cIsn\u2019t that what the American people want in a president?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking for mashed potatoes.\u201dImageQuestions about Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s behavior toward subordinates have shadowed the early days of her 2020 presidential campaign.CreditTim Gruber for The New York TimesOthers said that Ms. Klobuchar often squandered time and mental energy on trivial matters, obsessing over perceived snubs in news media clickbait about who was up or down in Washington and repeatedly suggesting that an inferior staff was standing in her way.\u201cSenator Leahy, I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t put up with this,\u201d she once said of her colleague, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the longest-serving active senator, according to a person present.Some former aides who were frequent targets of her ire acknowledged that the senator often had a point, praising her intelligence and political antenna. She has been re-elected in two landslides, including a 24-point victory last year in a state President Trump lost narrowly.But her blistering feedback to staff was often substantially out of proportion to the offense, these former aides said. Word choice or grammatical issues could make Ms. Klobuchar especially furious, not only in prepared text but also in office meetings or common speech. Words like \u201cstraight-shooting\u201d and \u201cabsolutely\u201d were known to invite her scorn. She urged staff members never to say that another senator \u201cled\u201d something and asked them to call her a \u201cco-sponsor\u201d of legislation instead of a supporter, suggesting that the latter sounded weak.Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s exasperation often appeared connected to two factors: an abiding fear of being embarrassed in front of colleagues or in the press and the conviction that she works harder than her staff.In one message, in which she said she had not been prepared properly for an event, Ms. Klobuchar reminded her team of the hours she kept.\u201cPlease don\u2019t claim lack of time,\u201d she wrote, asking what else might explain their failure. \u201cI flew in at one in the morning. I don\u2019t have that luxury to blame lack of time. Unless YOU were up working at one am, and up again five am the next day, please don\u2019t claim lack of time. That was when I was up.\u201dIn private, she could deliver slashing remarks without particular provocation. Parched one day in the Capitol, she turned to a member of her team and said, \u201cI would trade three of you for a bottle of water,\u201d according to a person who witnessed it.Former aides said Ms. Klobuchar frequently told them they were damaging her political career. On one occasion, a former aide recalled, Ms. Klobuchar accused her of \u201cruining my marriage,\u201d too. (The aide said she interpreted the comment to mean that Ms. Klobuchar, in her telling, was forced to work overtime, away from family, to overcome the aide\u2019s failings.)Many staff members did warmly recall the misery-loves-company camaraderie that built among aggrieved aides. But the core truth of life with Ms. Klobuchar was never going to change, they said: She thought she was demanding their best and getting far less. And she was never going to apologize for pointing that out.\u201cI need to do some serious soul searching about our office,\u201d she said in one email, lamenting the team\u2019s work product. \u201cHow can you treat me like this time and time again?\u201d"}, {"title": "On Politics: Trump and Advisers May Have Different Goals for North Korea", "category": "Politics", "id": "b10a53bd-aac5-4cb2-9213-5ac0c959de12", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/us/politics/trump-north-korea.html", "publishdate": 20190222, "imageurl": "", "content": "Good Friday morning.

Or should labor groups seek cooperation with employers, even if the resulting deals do little to advance labor\u2019s broader goals?The debate has flared up around labor\u2019s efforts to make inroads with the likes of Uber and Airbnb, businesses that allow drivers and homeowners to earn income as contractors. And it was on vivid display in the political battle over Amazon\u2019s plan to create a new headquarters in New York with 25,000 jobs.The plan fell apart in the face of a backlash over public subsidies, resentment of the covert process in which the city and the state negotiated the deal, and concern about its neighborhood impact. But labor issues were also a factor, giving rise to tensions even among unions.In the more confrontational camp were labor groups led by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which called on the city and the state to withhold nearly $3 billion in subsidies unless Amazon established a \u201cfair process\u201d for its warehouse workers in the city to unionize. The retail workers said they were open to negotiating what that meant.ImagePart of the site in Long Island City that was slated for the headquarters.

They were joined by a Service Employees International Union local, which had gained the right to represent janitors and other service workers at the Queens complex.[Read more: How New York City became a tech town, without leaning on big tech.]\u201cTheir presence in New York \u2014 a progressive community, a union town \u2014 was eventually going to lead to some potential change down the road,\u201d said H\u00e9ctor J. Figueroa, the president of the service employees local, known as 32BJ.Even Without Amazon, Tech Could Keep Gaining Ground in New YorkIn terms of economic, political and cultural impact, the finance industry dominates. But tech is gaining fast, and is where much of the growth is.In some respects, these arguments go back decades. Thomas Kochan, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noted that the United Automobile Workers and General Motors negotiated a new arrangement when the company set up its Saturn division in the mid-1980s. In exchange for a role in managerial duties, the union agreed to forgo many of the work rules typical in other plants, such as those governing which worker could do what job. The arrangement stoked tensions within the union and the company for years.But in recent years the growing reach of tech conglomerates has created urgency within labor to court their workers, Mr. Kochan said.Despite their minimal presence in these companies, unions have a variety of levers to pull. They can exert influence through politicians when public subsidies are involved, as in the Amazon case. And they can pressure regulators to scrutinize businesses that upend traditional industries, like transportation and hospitality.Whether to use these levers to force concessions, or to take a less adversarial approach that would give labor a foothold in big tech, has divided the labor movement.In 2016, Uber reached a five-year agreement with a regional branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to create a drivers\u2019 guild, which would advocate on behalf of drivers but not challenge their status as independent contractors. The Machinists would also have to refrain from turning the guild into a formal union during that time. In exchange, Uber agreed to provide the organization with funding and a way to communicate directly with drivers. The guild says a majority of its revenue comes from other sources.A rival group representing professional drivers criticized the Machinists for creating a so-called company union \u2014 federal law prohibits unions that companies fund or control, though the law applies only to workers who are employees. Some union officials complained that the guild was anti-democratic, since drivers hadn\u2019t elected Machinists officials to represent them.But Sharon Block, a senior Labor Department official under President Barack Obama, argued that the deal was defensible. Ms. Block pointed out that the guild had taken something of a hybrid approach between cooperation and antagonism, lobbying for policies such as a minimum earnings standard for drivers and allowing passengers to tip, both of which have been enacted in New York.\u201cThere are situations in which taking the half loaf can be worthwhile,\u201d Ms. Block said.Around the same time, the Service Employees International Union was completing a deal with Airbnb in which the company would connect hosts who needed their homes cleaned with unionized workers, an approach that the two sides were already testing in New York and Los Angeles.The agreement collapsed after a prominent hospitality workers union, Unite Here, protested that the deal would merely provide political cover to Airbnb, which the union accuses of destroying good-paying hotel jobs and creating housing shortages.The union\u2019s president, D. Taylor, said that Unite Here was always open to working with employers, but that unions typically lacked the clout to cut good deals when they wandered into an industry where their presence was weak.\u201cYou\u2019re settling a contract that has lower standards than the dominant union in that industry could get because you don\u2019t have leverage,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.The service workers\u2019 union declined to comment.Given the number of people Amazon employs \u2014 more than 250,000 in the United States, not including seasonal workers \u2014 and its influence over numerous industries, the proposed New York headquarters arguably represented the highest stakes yet for a test of these competing approaches.Some experts said a deal allowing a union to represent building-service workers at the proposed Amazon complex could have been valuable.\u201cThey have the opportunity to show the people who work there at all levels that unionization is good,\u201d said Catherine Fisk, an expert on labor law at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThat it\u2019s a way to equitably allocate wages, that there is an orderly process for dealing with sexual harassment allegations, with issues about absenteeism \u2014 whatever the company is concerned about.\u201dBut others were skeptical that allowing janitorial workers to unionize would have any benefit for the company\u2019s broader work force in New York, much less anywhere else in the country.The problem, said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, is that servicing buildings is just too far removed from what most Amazon workers do. Many companies have unionized building-service workers but are otherwise union-free, she said.Like those companies, Amazon seemed intent on drawing the line at service workers: It walked away from discussions with labor about a framework that could have made it easier to organize employees who perform core functions, like packing goods at the company\u2019s fulfillment centers.ImageA worker at Amazon\u2019s warehouse on Staten Island. The company says it has more than 5,000 employees in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island and expects that number to grow.CreditJohannes Eisele/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesThe question is whether Amazon can sustain this hard line indefinitely. If it can, progressives and labor activists may have contributed to the loss of 25,000 jobs and billions in future tax revenue without winning any tangible benefits for workers.But there is reason to believe that Amazon may have to bargain with labor in New York at some point, and that unions and other progressive groups will have established an important principle when that happens.After all, many of Amazon\u2019s facilities are not like automobile plants or call centers, in that the company can easily plunk them down anywhere. Amazon tends to locate warehouses reasonably close to customers, of whom there are potentially millions in the New York area. It has sought to put its white-collar hubs in areas with many high-skilled workers, a practice that also favors cities like New York.In its statement about the demise of the Queens plan, the company noted that there \u201care currently over 5,000 Amazon employees in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island, and we plan to continue growing these teams.\u201dAnd that logic is likely to apply to a variety of tech companies that seek customers and workers in liberal hubs.\u201cYou don\u2019t have huge numbers of highly educated people who they need who want to move to small cities in Arkansas,\u201d Professor Fisk said. \u201cI think California and New York and a lot of other places may have more leverage to insist on the highroad approach.\u201d"}, {"title": "Those Credit Card Bonuses May Be Taxable", "category": "Business", "id": "4d10a81e-e6ca-4714-a562-6476aa89fea2", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/your-money/credit-card-bonuses-taxes.html", "publishdate": 20190222, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/23/business/23Adviser-illo/merlin_151020135_19720de2-ca1d-431d-aaf7-0c14fc53de5b-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Have you gotten a bonus from your credit card company for successfully referring friends or family for new cards? You may owe taxes on that bonus.People who thought they were getting a perk with no strings attached are getting 1099 tax forms from some major card brands, including Chase, American Express and Discover.It\u2019s been unwelcome news. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where you don\u2019t really think ahead about the tax implications,\u201d said Rebecca Hawes, legislative counsel to the National Association of Enrolled Agents, a professional group for federally certified tax experts.The forms known as 1099s are used to report various types of nonwage earnings, including miscellaneous income. In general, if a business pays you at least $600, it must report the payments to you \u2014 and to the Internal Revenue Service \u2014 using Form 1099.Whether rewards or bonuses are taxable depends on whether they are tied to spending on the card, tax experts say. If you get cash back or rewards from a credit card in exchange for buying things with the card, the Internal Revenue Service generally doesn\u2019t consider the rewards taxable, said Donald Zidik, a certified public accountant at Waldron H. Rand & Company, near Boston.If, for instance, you earn 2 percent cash back for the amount you spend, or earn 5,000 bonus points or frequent flier miles if you spend a certain amount of money within three months of opening the card account, that\u2019s not taxable. \u201cIt\u2019s considered more of a rebate or discount,\u201d Mr. Zidik said.But if you earn a reward or bonus for simply opening an account \u2014 or referring a friend who opens a new account \u2014 that amount is considered to be taxable. Hence, the tax forms some consumers are receiving.American Express has sent 1099-MISC forms to cardholders, with copies to the I.R.S., if they earned $600 or more in total value for referral bonuses in 2018, said a spokeswoman, Heather Norton. She said the company discloses in the terms of its offer that the value of a referral bonus may be taxable income.\u201cThe value of the Referral Bonus may be taxable income to you, and we may be required to send you a Form 1099-MISC and file it with the I.R.S.,\u201d reads a notice for an offer attached to the American Express Gold Delta SkyMiles card, for example.Mary Jane Rogers, a spokeswoman for Chase, says that issuing 1099-MISC forms isn\u2019t new. The forms reflect payments for items like referral bonuses, which are given to customers who refer a friend to Chase, or a bonus for customers who sign up for paperless bank statements.In Chase\u2019s case, she said, the forms are likely getting attention from customers because the bank made errors in calculating the amounts on a \u201cfew thousand\u201d forms and had to reissue them.Some Chase forms sent this year showed much higher dollar amounts than expected, according to the credit card website Doctor of Credit. In some cases, the bank reported a bonus of 500 points as $500, which assigns a value of $1 per point \u2014 much higher than is typical.Assigning a cash value to rewards points or frequent flier miles is a bit of a gray area since the value of points can vary depending on how the cardholder redeems them. But a value of 1 cent per point is common, said Brian Riley, director of the credit advisory service at Mercator Advisory Group. At a penny a point, 500 points would equal $5.At Discover, card holders who earned $600 or more on \u201cnontransactional\u201d rewards are sent 1099-MISC tax forms, said a spokesman, Derek Cuculich. Those include rewards for referring a friend, a one-time cash back \u201cmatch\u201d bonus given to new cardholders and the \u201cgood grades\u201d program, which offers statement credits of $20 a year to holders of its student card if they maintain a grade-point average of 3.0 or higher.There haven\u2019t been any recent public edicts from the I.R.S. on the topic, Mr. Zidik said. But banks may be influenced by a 2014 ruling by the United States Tax Court, which held that the value of an airline ticket bought with frequent flier miles that were received as a premium, in exchange for opening a bank account, must be included as income.\u201cThe tax court case could likely be driving the banks to issue the 1099s,\u201d Mr. Zidik said. The banks could also face penalties, he said, for not issuing the forms when required.Here are some questions and answers about credit card bonuses:Do I have to report card bonuses as income if I don\u2019t receive a Form 1099?You should. While the card company must send out the form for payments to an individual that total $600 or more, a bonus is considered income even if it\u2019s below that threshold, Mr. Zidik said. \u201cAny type of income, no matter how small, has to be reported,\u201d he said.How much you actually pay in taxes on the amount, however, depends on your overall income and tax bracket, Ms. Hawes said.What if I receive a corrected 1099 form after filing my tax return?In general, if people get a corrected 1099-MISC, they should contact their tax professional because they may need to file an amended return, Mr. Zidik said.Does this make referring friends to get a bonus more hassle than it\u2019s worth?\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a disincentive,\u201d Mr. Riley at Mercator said. Although the amounts involved may be relatively small, he said, you still have to pay attention to forms that are filed with the I.R.S., to avoid potential penalties or interest for underreporting income.Scott Mayerowitz, executive editorial director at The Points Guy, a website that covers card rewards topics, said having to pay taxes does take away some of the positive feelings from earning bonuses. But it\u2019s likely that in most cases, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re still coming out ahead.\u201dMs. Rogers, of Chase, said, \u201cOur customers love the rewards that come with our cards, and we really don\u2019t hear concerns about tax implications.\u201d"}, {"title": "A Teacher\u2019s Student Loans Were Forgiven.

He had spent years struggling to get the loan forgiveness that federal law provides for public servants like him, and those checks from the United States Treasury covered what he\u2019d paid beyond his obligation. His loan balance was officially zero. But he\u2019s not done, not by a long shot. Earlier this month, he went into Lowe\u2019s to buy a new refrigerator and applied for a store credit card to get a 10 percent discount. He was turned down on the spot.FedLoan, the loan servicer for public servants in the forgiveness program, had given him a little parting gift: a delinquency report to the scorekeepers at Equifax, Experian and TransUnion that effectively wrecked his credit.Mr. Shafer was not late with his payments, though the three bureaus had him marked 120 to 180 days tardy. In fact, he had made extra payments in a bend-over-backward effort to make himself bulletproof in the eyes of the federal government and its agents. It didn\u2019t work.We should not be the least bit surprised, either. The public service loan forgiveness program is an administrative debacle, as I\u2019ve chronicled for a couple of years now \u2014 just by following Mr. Shafer, who has devoted his career to teaching at-risk teens in Eugene, Ore. The Saga of Jed ShaferA Student Loan Nightmare: The Teacher in the Wrong Payment PlanOct. 27, 2017A Student Loan Fix for a Teacher, and Many Other Public ServantsMarch 30, 2018How to Apply for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Fix-It FundMay 23, 2018A Teacher\u2019s Long Road to Student Loan Forgiveness (and a $4,500 Surprise)Dec. 7, 2018The forgiveness program is just one part of a fundamentally broken student loan servicing system, as the Department of Education\u2019s own inspector general pointed out last week. In a scathing report, he said that the organizations the department pays to help borrowers with repayment were out of compliance on 61 percent of the 343 interactions it monitored from 2015 to 2017. Mr. Shafer\u2019s servicer, FedLoan (which is part of the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency), was among the worst.When Mr. Shafer went to Lowe\u2019s, he was doing exactly what federal policymakers might hope. After more than a decade repaying his debts, he was taking that newly available cash and funneling it into the American economy. Or at least he was trying to. Those store cards are usually pretty easy to get, so Mr. Shafer\u2019s denial was disconcerting. After a bit of investigation, he found that his credit scores had fallen 125 to 150 points, depending on which bureau he asked.I scoured his credit reports and found that FedLoan had marked him months past due on his loan, even though he had made on-time monthly payments through his bank\u2019s autopay service until the day his loan statement stated that he had zero dollars due. The FedLoan delinquency notices were the only thing in the credit reports that could explain the decline in his scores and the rejection at Lowe\u2019s.Mr. Shafer called FedLoan\u2019s customer service line to try to get an explanation. The inspector general report listed FedLoan\u2019s parent organization as the worst performer among nine servicers in a survey of customer-service calls in April and May of 2017, so perhaps he should not have expected much in the way of assistance.Sure enough, after minutes of what sounded like head-scratching, the representative Mr. Shafer spoke with said that the situation made no sense to him, either. His solution was to tell Mr. Shafer to send his credit reports to a FedLoan post office box in Harrisburg, Pa., for follow-up. And no, he said, there was no one Mr. Shafer could talk to about it on the phone.In its response to the inspector general\u2019s report, P.H.E.A.A. said in a statement last week that since 2017, it had spent millions of dollars to improve its service. \u201cThis includes the ability to quickly match uniquely complex calls with the right customer service agent who has the specialized experience needed to provide white-glove level of assistance regardless of the complicating circumstance.\u201dBut asking someone whose credit you\u2019ve trashed to send the matter away to a post office box for consideration is not white-glove service. It\u2019s not even boxing-glove service. It\u2019s an open hand across the face.Mr. Shafer didn\u2019t want to wait around for FedLoan\u2019s envelope-rippers, so I took the matter to Keith New, P.H.E.A.A.\u2019s spokesman. At first, he said that the organization could not find any \u201cnegative reporting action\u201d on Mr. Shafer\u2019s account.Two days later, he emailed me the following: \u201cWe identified a timing issue involving an automated adjustment process for the credit reporting on the loan for November, 2018. We submitted a credit reporting adjustment immediately and have since confirmed with all of the consumer reporting agencies that there are no delinquencies reporting on his account. A letter is being sent/emailed to Jed today reaffirming the action taken to ensure that his account reflects no delinquencies.\u201dThat same day, Mr. Shafer got a note from Stephanie Galloway, a FedLoan vice president. \u201cWe wish to express our sincerest apologies and regret any inconvenience this may have caused you,\u201d it said.Just to be certain, we checked his credit again a few hours after I heard from Mr. New, with Mr. Shafer and his wife paying the fee themselves to do so. Indeed, the problem was fixed and his FICO credit scores \u2014 which are what most lenders look at when checking up on individuals \u2014 were very good once more.Mr. Shafer, who often hears from other struggling public servants who manage to track down his email address, is glad he did not have to resort to the mail. \u201cThere is a level of anxiety that I know people feel when they have to start sending stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThat post office box in Harrisburg has to be one of the most feared and dreaded P.O. boxes in the history of humankind.\u201d So how exactly did this error happen, and will it happen to others? The origin is not clear, but Mr. New said it would not happen again. \u201cWe've confirmed that this was indeed an isolated instance and have addressed the root cause within the process so no other borrower should experience any negative issues,\u201d he said in an email. Seth Frotman, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center and the former student loan ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said he was not that surprised, given P.H.E.A.A.\u2019s history of problems with credit reporting. He reminded me that P.H.E.A.A. had once asked the Supreme Court to spare it from having to abide by the rules that lenders in the banking industry must follow.\u201cThese companies are huge furnishers of credit reporting info, which means that the financial future and credit history and the cost of credit for millions of borrowers are tied up in these companies getting it right,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just one example of the numerous ways in which they are failing at this miserably.\u201dIf you, too, have run the public service loan forgiveness gantlet and think you have succeeded, check your credit reports before you throw a party and use your loan correspondence as confetti. If there\u2019s a problem, email me so I can help you get it fixed. That way, your wrecked credit won\u2019t delay a car or home purchase any longer than necessary, and you can avoid waiting around for weeks while someone at a FedLoan post office box deals with your situation.But before we go, let us lament, once again, the fact that this sort of warning and intervention is necessary at all. Public service loan forgiveness was a program with bipartisan backing. Surely, we can all agree that our teachers and nurses and firefighters should not have to put up with so much to get what they earned."}, {"title": "On Politics With Lisa Lerer: A Chat With Dan Crenshaw", "category": "Politics", "id": "e9c89476-1d13-41af-9771-ea2c737f2474", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/us/politics/on-politics-dan-crenshaw.html", "publishdate": 20190222, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/21/us/politics/21onpolitics-pm/21onpolitics-pm-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.A lot has been made of the new Democratic majority in the House. They\u2019re young. Female. Diverse. Outspoken.All the focus on Democrats made us curious about what being in the new Congress looks like from the other side of the aisle.Representative Dan Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL with no prior experience in elected office, has emerged as one of the stars of the new Republican class. He survived a crowded primary race and a runoff for the Republican nomination last year, en route to winning his Houston-area district.But real fame came shortly after the election, when Mr. Crenshaw, who wears an eye patch because of an injury he suffered in Afghanistan, appeared on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d to rebut the comedian Pete Davidson, who had mocked Mr. Crenshaw as looking like a \u201chit man from a porno movie.\u201d The two offered a sincere plea for civility, and a political star was born.Since then, Mr. Crenshaw\u2019s staunch support for President Trump\u2019s border wall and his fiery presence on social media have some Republicans calling him the conservative answer to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.We recently talked with Mr. Crenshaw about the wall, social media and civility in politics. The interview was conducted before Mr. Trump agreed on a border deal, but we decided to leave in those parts of the conversation, because the debate over the wall isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. As usual, our interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Lisa: You came into Congress in the middle of the shutdown. Was that frustrating? I mean, you\u2019re here to make a difference, presumably, and you enter in a stalemate. Dan Crenshaw: The frustrating part for me is why we were shut down. You can\u2019t just be mad at a shutdown. You do have to take a side. And in the end, this shutdown boils down to $5 billion over basically extending the authorizations we\u2019ve had in the past. That\u2019s what\u2019s frustrating, that we\u2019re actually arguing over that.Well, it\u2019s about the wall, right? Sure. To me, it\u2019s frustrating that we can\u2019t come to a deal. I mean, the idea of a government shutdown, it\u2019s a consequence of our system. The president is under no obligation to sign the spending bills that Congress gives to him. And once that happens, once he says no, then you\u2019re supposed to negotiate. So the frustrating part was to see how the Democrats refused to negotiate.That didn\u2019t really make it out into the media very much because \u2014 I mean, we can say it all we want, but the media, generally speaking, the CNN pundits and The New York Times, will generally call it the \u201cTrump shutdown,\u201d because he owned it initially. I get that. But once he owned it, he asked to negotiate, and I think that\u2019s a pretty fair ask. He did not have anyone to negotiate with. So that was frustrating, to watch that play out from the inside.Now, it looks like maybe the deal will be less money for the wall, or some kind of fencing.The semantics over wall versus fencing, first of all, are highly misleading. Trump\u2019s plan has been what normal people would describe as fencing for a long time now. I get that he still calls it a wall. But that\u2019s because in our English language a normal person would go up to what we have on the border right now and say it\u2019s a wall, or a fence, and they\u2019d both be right.What we\u2019re actually talking about is steel bollard fencing. Again, it\u2019s a mass misinformation campaign by the other side on this. And that\u2019s been amplified by a lot of the media, is that we\u2019re just talking about 2,000 miles of, like, concrete wall. It\u2019s so unbelievably false.I want like a giant reset button to be like, \u201cO.K., let\u2019s start the debate over,\u201d because I wasn\u2019t here when we started the debate. Now I am. I\u2019d like us to be very honest about what we\u2019re talking about.Sounds like you\u2019re describing a messaging problem for Republicans. I don\u2019t have all the answers, but I think the way I\u2019d describe the right way to message is to help people understand the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the \u201cwhat.\u201d It\u2019s like, why do I believe we need extra fencing down the southern border? And in a deeper \u201cwhy\u201d than just, \u201cHey, it\u2019s security and murders and crime.\u201d Some of that\u2019s true, but it leads us into a debate about how much crime and how much drugs.The \u201cwhy\u201d is: We enforce our laws, and because we believe in our own sovereignty, and I believe that illegal immigrants shouldn\u2019t be able to cut in front of legal immigrants. That\u2019s a better \u201cwhy.\u201dTraditionally in Washington, there was an idea that as a new member you come in and keep a low profile. You \u2014 and other freshmen \u2014 are clearly taking a different approach. Why? There was no, like, decision point. They listen to me because I just have a large following, and yeah, I got famous on national TV.There\u2019s a sequence of events that drew us here. It\u2019s like, you know, why is A.O.C. [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] famous? It\u2019s just that story of beating Joe Crowley. Once that hooks people, and you\u2019ve got that following, that\u2019s sort of self-perpetuating. There isn\u2019t really a rule, necessarily, that the leadership tries to keep freshmen from talking.You\u2019ve used some of that platform to call for a return to civility. What does that look like for you? It just looks like, don\u2019t question the other people\u2019s character.You can be pretty sharp, particularly on Twitter.Yeah, I can be sharp. But what I never say is, you know \u2014 let me give an example of what they do to us all the time. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that because you\u2019re a white Christian man.\u201d That\u2019s not civil. That\u2019s avoiding the debate of ideas and attacking a person because of who they are. That\u2019s not O.K.I will attack ideas very hard. I am not shy about that one bit. So I don\u2019t want people to think that because I had a call for civility that that means I shy away from debate and that I\u2019m agreeable. That\u2019s not the case. What is the case is that I will not question who you are as a person.You can say that your ideas are bad for America, and frankly un-American, but don\u2019t say the person is a traitor. That\u2019s the line that we should aspire to, at least in the short term.Do you think the president crosses that line?Well, let\u2019s see. I\u2019m trying to think of some examples.Lyin\u2019 Ted, Liddle Marco, Horseface. I can keep going.Yeah. Those are examples. Sure.So name-calling, in general, is bad, and then what I see from the other side is like, if you\u2019re calling someone a racist, bigot, homophobe \u2014 and they have their list, right? And that\u2019s terrible. You know what, with everything happening in Virginia right now, are we all on social media calling him a racist? No, actually, we\u2019re saying you did something racist. See, that\u2019s the difference. To say someone is a racist, versus saying you did something or said something that could be perceived as racist.You think there\u2019s a way to unwind this new tone?Just be part of the solution and not part of the problem. That\u2019s the only way.[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter from The Times about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]____________________Drop us a line!ImageWe want to hear from our readers.

With that in mind, we wanted to update you on some topics we\u2019ve recently written about.\u2022 Virginia\u2019s troubled governor, Ralph Northam, has clung to his seat despite pressure to resign over a racist photo found on his yearbook page. Now, a set of new polls shows that he may survive the scandal. In two new surveys of Virginians (here and here), a plurality say Mr. Northam should stay in office, and even more oppose impeaching the governor. The voters were more divided over whether Lt. Gov. Justin E. Fairfax, accused of sexually assaulting two women, should resign.\u2022  Breaking news today from North Carolina: After days of testimony about an alleged scheme to tamper with absentee votes in a congressional race, state officials have ordered a new election. The decision came after Mark Harris, the Republican candidate whose apparent victory was under investigation, called for a do-over.\u2022 Two weeks ago, Lisa Friedman, a climate reporter at The Times, gave us a rundown of the Green New Deal. Today, Lisa published a deep look into the details of the plan, exploring its plausibility. What did she find? The far-reaching plan is \u201cwithin the realm of technological possibility,\u201d experts say. But it will take \u201cextensive sacrifices that people are only starting to understand.\u201d Read the article here.\u2022  In our newsletter this week about Bernie Sanders\u2019s entrance into the 2020 race, we mentioned that he was starting off with a huge advantage in the size of his donor base. Well, it seems that has already paid off \u2014 to the tune of $6 million in donations in his first day. For comparison, the second-biggest debut this year was Kamala Harris, with $1.5 million on her first day.____________________The SoapboxImageThis is The Soapbox, a forum for you to share your thoughts with us and your fellow On Politics readers. In today\u2019s edition, readers sound off on Bernie Sanders\u2019s decision to run for president again.Teresa Monley wrote in to explain why she still supports Mr. Sanders:If we had Medicare for All, affordable college costs, were on our way to rebuilding the Middle Class, then I would say: Good job, sir. No need for you to run. We are not even close yet. He pulled the party to a place where they recognize the plight of most of the population. He started a movement.His ideas are resonating with the great majority of Americans. We are not radical, but quite pragmatic. So is Bernie. He\u2019s a teacher and a leader. That\u2019s why I\u2019m supporting him.Bonnie H., in Washington, said Mr. Sanders\u2019s energy would be better spent elsewhere:So many wonderful candidates running in 2020. Sorry Bernie, you are a spoiler, too old and will further divide the party as you did in 2016. Let\u2019s all move on. Work your magic in the new Democratic Senate in 2020!Victor Lidz, from Pennsylvania, said he was concerned by Mr. Sanders\u2019s age:Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden may be reluctant to acknowledge their ages and the inevitable limitations on their capacities to serve as president. However, the country would be ill-advised to entrust the powers of the presidency to individuals who will enter their 80s during a first term. I write as an academic approaching 80 myself, still in good health and retaining my capacities well enough to teach, write, and participate in conferences. Yet, I know of my impending limitations and Sanders and Biden should recognize theirs as well. The Democratic Party has younger, vigorous, and creative candidates. It is time for their elders to relinquish leadershipAnd Monica D\u2019Amore, from New Jersey, said Mr. Sanders\u2019s flaw was in his approach:Not everyone gets a rush from statistics. The Dems (and Bernie) must learn how to modify their rhetoric to appeal to the common man. The campaign trail is a place to persuade, and that\u2019s difficult to do when you\u2019re making people feel stupid.In my opinion, people want to be spoken to in language that they can relate to. Many feel that Hillary talks down to us \u2014 in other words, she\u2019s talking to Lisa, but most of the voters are Bart. I\u2019ve been listening to sound bites of Bernie\u2019s announcement to run and I cringe at hearing the same old song: Statistic Reprisal.If you want to share your thoughts, send us an email: onpolitics@nytimes.com.____________________What to read tonight\u2022 China collected millions of its citizens\u2019 DNA in a campaign of surveillance and oppression.

His efforts have exposed him to accusations of obstruction of justice as Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, wraps up his probe.In the coming weeks, Mr. Mueller is expected to deliver his final account of a nearly two-year investigation into Russia\u2019s election interference to William Barr, the new attorney general.

The move left Senate Republicans sharply divided, and it remains to be seen whether they will act collectively to try to stop it.Speaker Nancy Pelosi began her push to overturn the emergency declaration on Friday, scheduling a House vote for Tuesday \u2014 a remarkably short timeline \u2014 on legislation that would end it.But Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to build his border wall involves more than his invocation of emergency powers to redirect military construction funds.

Unlike alcohol or opioids, phones aren\u2019t an addictive substance so much as a species-level environmental shock. We might someday evolve the correct biological hardware to live in harmony with portable supercomputers that satisfy our every need and connect us to infinite amounts of stimulation. But for most of us, it hasn\u2019t happened yet.I\u2019ve been a heavy phone user for my entire adult life. But sometime last year, I crossed the invisible line into problem territory. My symptoms were all the typical ones: I found myself incapable of reading books, watching full-length movies or having long uninterrupted conversations. Social media made me angry and anxious, and even the digital spaces I once found soothing (group texts, podcasts, YouTube k-holes) weren\u2019t helping. I tried various tricks to curb my usage, like deleting Twitter every weekend, turning my screen grayscale and installing app-blockers. But I always relapsed.Eventually, in late December, I decided that enough was enough. I called Catherine Price, a science journalist and the author of \u201cHow to Break Up With Your Phone,\u201d a 30-day guide to eliminating bad phone habits. And I begged her for help.Mercifully, she agreed to be my phone coach for the month of January, and walk me through her plan, step by step. Together, we would build a healthy relationship with my phone, and try to unbreak my brain.\u2018A Bit Horrifying\u2019ImageOn a video call with Catherine Price, the Marie Kondo of brains.CreditDemetrius Freeman for The New York TimesI confess that entering phone rehab feels clich\u00e9d, like getting really into healing crystals or Peloton. Digital wellness is a budding industry these days, with loads of self-help gurus offering miracle cures for screen addiction. Some of those solutions involve new devices \u2014 such as the \u201cLight Phone,\u201d a device with an extremely limited feature set that is meant to wean users off time-sucking apps. Others focus on cutting out screens entirely for weeks on end. You can now buy $299 \u201cdigital detox\u201d packages at luxury hotels or join the \u201cdigital sabbath\u201d movement, whose adherents vow to spend one day a week using no technology at all.Thankfully, Catherine\u2019s plan is more practical. I\u2019m a tech columnist, and while I don\u2019t begrudge anyone for trying more extreme forms of disconnection, my job prevents me from going cold turkey.Instead, her program focuses on addressing the root causes of phone addiction, including the emotional triggers that cause you to reach for your phone in the first place. The point isn\u2019t to get you off the internet, or even off social media \u2014 you\u2019re still allowed to use Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms on a desktop or laptop, and there\u2019s no hard-and-fast time limit. It\u2019s simply about unhooking your brain from the harmful routines it has adopted around this particular device, and hooking it to better things.When we started, I sent her my screen time statistics, which showed that I had spent 5 hours and 37 minutes on my phone that day, and picked it up 101 times \u2014 roughly twice as many as the average American.\u201cThat is frankly insane and makes me want to die,\u201d I wrote to her.\u201cI will admit that those numbers are a bit horrifying,\u201d she replied.[More from Kevin Roose: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Electric Scooters.]Catherine encouraged me to set up mental speed bumps so that I would be forced to think for a second before engaging with my phone. I put a rubber band around the device, for example, and changed my lock screen to one that showed three questions to ask myself every time I unlocked my phone: \u201cWhat for? Why now? What else?\u201dFor the rest of the week, I became acutely aware of the bizarre phone habits I\u2019d developed. I noticed that I reach for my phone every time I brush my teeth or step outside the front door of my apartment building, and that, for some pathological reason, I always check my email during the three-second window between when I insert my credit card into a chip reader at a store and when the card is accepted.Mostly, I became aware of how profoundly uncomfortable I am with stillness. For years, I\u2019ve used my phone every time I\u2019ve had a spare moment in an elevator or a boring meeting. I listen to podcasts and write emails on the subway. I watch YouTube videos while folding laundry. I even use an app to pretend to meditate.If I was going to repair my brain, I needed to practice doing nothing. So during my morning walk to the office, I looked up at the buildings around me, spotting architectural details I\u2019d never noticed before. On the subway, I kept my phone in my pocket and people-watched \u2014 noticing the nattily dressed man in the yellow hat, the teens eating hot Takis and laughing, the kid with Velcro shoes. When a friend ran late for our lunch, I sat still and stared out the window instead of checking Twitter.It\u2019s an unnerving sensation, being alone with your thoughts in the year 2019. Catherine had warned me that I might feel existential malaise when I wasn\u2019t distracting myself with my phone. She also said paying more attention to my surroundings would make me realize how many other people used their phones to cope with boredom and anxiety.\u201cI compare it to seeing a family member naked,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce you look around the elevator and see the zombies checking their phones, you can\u2019t unsee it.\u201d[Get more advice from The Times on living a more fulfilling life.

I kept messaging services like WhatsApp and Signal, and non-distracting utilities like cooking and navigation apps. I pruned my home screen to just the essentials: calendar, email and password manager. And I disabled push notifications for everything other than phone calls and messages from a preset list of people that included my editor, my wife and a handful of close friends.[More from Kevin Roose: Is Tech Too Easy to Use?]Where you keep your phone is also important. Studies have shown that people who don\u2019t charge their phones in their bedrooms are significantly happier than those who do. Catherine charges her phone in a closet; for me, she recommended a locking mini-safe. I bought one and started storing my phone inside, which simultaneously reduced my nighttime usage and made me feel like I was guarding the queen\u2019s jewels.And I pursued activities that could replace my phone habit. On the recommendation of my colleague Farhad Manjoo, I signed up for pottery classes. As it turned out, pottery makes a perfect phone substitute. It\u2019s manually challenging and demands concentration for hours on end. It gets your hands dirty, too, which is a good deterrent to fiddling with expensive electronics.After a pottery class, I updated my wife on my progress. I told her that while it felt great to disconnect, I still worried that I was missing something important. I liked having a constant stream of news at my fingertips, and I wanted to do more of the things I actually like about social media, like keeping tabs on my friends\u2019 babies and maintaining ambient Kardashian awareness.\u201cI\u2019m sad that you\u2019re having trouble with this,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s been great for me.\u201dShe explained that since my phone detox started, I\u2019d been more present and attentive at home. I spent more time listening to her, and less time distractedly nodding and mumbling while checking my inbox or tapping out tweets.Psychologists have a name for this: \u201cphubbing,\u201d or snubbing a person in favor of your phone. Studies have shown that excessive phubbing decreases relationship satisfaction and contributes to feelings of depression and alienation.For years, I\u2019ve justified my phubbing by treating it as a professional necessity. Isn\u2019t it my job to know when news happens? Won\u2019t I be neglecting my duties if it takes me an extra hour to learn that Jeff Bezos is getting divorced, or another YouTuber did something racist?I put this question to Catherine, who reassured me that I wasn\u2019t jeopardizing my career by being slightly later to the news. She reminded me that I\u2019d been happier since I dialed down my screen time, and she gently encouraged me to focus on the other side of the cost-benefit analysis.\u201cThink of the bigger picture of what you\u2019re getting by not being on Twitter all the time.\u201dA Thoreau CleansingImageRemember books?

(Catherine\u2019s program calls for a 24-hour separation, but I decided to try a more hard-core version.)I had dreaded this idea at the outset, but when the weekend actually arrived, I got giddy with excitement. I rented an off-the-grid Airbnb in the Catskills, warned my editor that I\u2019d be offline for the weekend and took off.A phone-free weekend involved some complications. Without Google Maps, I got lost and had to pull over for directions. Without Yelp, I had trouble finding open restaurants.But mostly, it was great. For two solid days, I basked in 19th-century leisure, feeling my nerves softening and my attention span stretching back out. I read books. I did the crossword puzzle. I lit a fire and looked at the stars. I felt like Thoreau, if Thoreau periodically wondered what was happening on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Instagram story.I also felt twinges of anger \u2014 at myself, for missing out on this feeling of restorative boredom for so many years; at the engineers in Silicon Valley who spend their days profitably exploiting our cognitive weaknesses; at the entire phone-industrial complex that has convinced us that a six-inch glass-and-steel rectangle is the ideal conduit for worldly experiences.Sadly, there is no way to talk about the benefits of digital disconnection without sounding like a Goop subscriber or a neo-Luddite. Performative wellness is obnoxious, as is reflexive technophobia.But I cannot stress enough that under the right conditions, spending an entire weekend without a phone in your immediate vicinity is incredible.

I now pick up my phone only about 20 times a day, down from more than 100. I still use my phone for email and texting \u2014 and I\u2019m still using my laptop plenty \u2014 but I don\u2019t itch for social media, and I often go hours without so much as a peek at any screen.In one of our conversations, I asked Catherine if she worried that I would relapse. She said it was possible, given the addictive properties of phones and the likelihood that they\u2019ll only keep getting more essential. But she said that as long as I remained aware of my relationship with my phone, and continued to notice when and how I used it, I\u2019d have gotten something valuable.\u201cYour life is what you pay attention to,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want to spend it on video games or Twitter, that\u2019s your business. But it should be a conscious choice.\u201dOne of the most unexpected benefits of this program is that by getting some emotional distance from my phone, I\u2019ve started to appreciate it again. I keep thinking: Right here, in my pocket, is a device that can summon food, cars and millions of other consumer goods to my door. I can talk with everyone I\u2019ve ever met, create and store a photographic record of my entire life, and tap into the entire corpus of human knowledge with a few swipes.Steve Jobs wasn\u2019t exaggerating when he described the iPhone as a kind of magical object, and it\u2019s truly wild that in the span of a few years, we\u2019ve managed to turn these amazing talismanic tools into stress-inducing albatrosses. It\u2019s as if scientists had invented a pill that gave us the ability to fly, only to find out that it also gave us dementia.But there is a way out. I haven\u2019t taken an M.R.I. or undergone a psychiatric evaluation, but I\u2019d bet that something fundamental has shifted inside my brain in the past month. A few weeks ago, the world on my phone seemed more compelling than the offline world \u2014 more colorful, faster-moving and with a bigger scope of rewards.I still love that world, and probably always will. But now, the physical world excites me, too \u2014 the one that has room for boredom, idle hands and space for thinking. I no longer feel phantom buzzes in my pocket or have dreams about checking my Twitter replies. I look people in the eye and listen when they talk. I ride the elevator empty-handed. And when I get sucked into my phone, I notice and self-correct.It\u2019s not a full recovery, and I\u2019ll have to stay vigilant.

Kraft\u2019s shares plunged 28 percent on Friday, lopping more than $16 billion off the company\u2019s stock market value.3G Capital, the Brazilian investment firm that led the merger of Kraft and Heinz in 2015 and steers the combined company, has taken a big financial hit on its 22 percent stake in Kraft. Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway has an even bigger stake in Kraft and lost an estimated $4 billion on Friday.The real pressure, though, is on 3G. Though little known on Main Street, 3G has enormous influence over some of America\u2019s most famous brands.Investors had bought into the idea that 3G\u2019s stringent, cost-cutting approach to running companies would succeed over the long run. But Kraft\u2019s problems suggest that unremittingly squeezing expenses can make it harder to stay competitive.Kraft Heinz may soon need to spend more. Consumers are increasingly drawn to products they perceive to be healthier and fresher over processed products. Kraft Heinz will have to show that it can win them back with innovative new products and engaging marketing. And that could weigh on future profits.\u201cThey did not anticipate this major change in consumer tastes, and they really focused their efforts instead on cost-cutting and doing acquisitions,\u201d said David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business.Kraft is not the only company where 3G\u2019s approach is being tested. The firm\u2019s partners have leadership positions at Anheuser-Busch InBev, which makes Budweiser. Long before 3G\u2019s investment in Kraft Heinz, its leaders were testing their cost-cutting strategies at the company that eventually became Anheuser-Busch InBev. The beer maker\u2019s shares are down nearly 30 percent over the last 12 months.3G also effectively controls Restaurant Brands International, whose brands include Burger King and Canada\u2019s Tim Hortons.Ken Goldman, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, asked Kraft\u2019s chief executive on Thursday night during an investor call whether the company\u2019s belt-tightening had damaged its brands. \u201cWe still believe strongly that our model is working and has a lot of potential for the future,\u201d Bernardo Hees, the chief executive, replied. On Friday, Mr. Goldman concluded in a research note, \u201cIt is reasonable to question the entire 3G strategy.\u201dThe write-down Kraft announced on Thursday totaled $15.4 billion. In taking the hit, the company reduced the value on its balance sheet of certain operations in the United States and Canada and the Kraft and Oscar Mayer trademarks. The company also jarred investors by announcing that it would slash its dividend. And the S.E.C. inquiry could stir up doubts in investors\u2019 minds about how Kraft records its costs.The company booked $25 million of costs in the fourth quarter that should have been recorded in earlier periods. Kraft said it was taking steps to improve its controls and added that it was continuing to cooperate with regulators.\u201cIn absolute terms, $25 million is not a big number, but it puts into question management\u2019s credibility,\u201d said Jon A. Baumunk, an accounting lecturer at San Diego State University\u2019s Fowler College of Business.Kraft\u2019s troubles could be another headache for Mr. Buffett, who has drawn criticism as an important supporter of the firm over the years.3G and Mr. Buffett merged Heinz with Kraft in a more than $45 billion deal that created the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world. \u201cThe 3G people have done marvelous purchases,\u201d Mr. Buffett said in 2015.But Mr. Buffett and 3G have seemed like a strange pairing. Mr. Buffett has long bashed private equity investors and their business model. He also has fostered a reputation for allowing the businesses that Berkshire purchases to operate with little interference and has not pushed for big job cuts. That would seem to stand in contrast to 3G\u2019s cost-cutting practices.In his annual letter to Berkshire\u2019s shareholders for 2015, Mr. Buffett defended 3G. He contended that like Berkshire, 3G wanted to hold businesses for the long term, which distinguished it from a typical private equity investor.Over the coming quarters, Kraft will have to show that it can compete in a market in which consumers want products they think are healthy and do not appear to be mass-produced. Other companies have had some success on this front, Mr. Kass, the business professor, said, pointing to some of PepsiCo\u2019s food products. \u201cPepsi has been realizing that growth is going to come from new products that are perceived to be healthier and nutritious,\u201d he said.And some analysts see evidence that suggests Kraft could still turn things around. It has had some success reviving interest in its Capri Sun and Oscar Mayer lines, said Christopher Growe, an analyst at Stifel who covers Kraft.\u201cThere is hope here,\u201d he said."}, {"title": "3 Borrowers Win Case on Eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness", "category": "Business", "id": "c1521c37-f55c-4b24-a99e-22f73f3abf15", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/your-money/public-service-loan-forgiveness-lawsuit.html", "publishdate": 20190223, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/us/24loan/merlin_151116609_30e8137a-d002-46a3-9ed6-1c403a3d9caa-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Three student loan borrowers scored a major victory against the Department of Education on Friday, when a federal judge laid the groundwork for a reversal of the department\u2019s determination that their employers were not eligible for the government\u2019s public service loan forgiveness program.In doing so, Judge Timothy J. Kelly, of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, declared one of the department\u2019s main legal arguments to be \u201cnonsense.\u201dBorrowers seeking to get their loans forgiven under the public service loan forgiveness program must have the right type of federal loan, make 120 on-time payments, enroll in the correct category of repayment plans and work for an eligible public-service employer.The legal dispute, which involved four public-interest lawyers who themselves filed suit, was over what kind of employer is eligible.Because about 25 percent of all federal student-loan borrowers end up working in public service, some cases were bound to emerge in the wake of the 2007 law that created the loan-forgiveness program. Several years after the law passed, the Education Department created employment certification forms that borrowers could use throughout their 120 months of repayment to try to head off any confusion about eligibility.In the case of the borrowers who filed suit, the department had indicated in a variety of ways (including through letters approving the borrowers\u2019 forms) that the plaintiffs were working for eligible employers. Then, however, the department changed its mind and made its decision retroactive, rendering years of payments ineligible toward the 120-month count.When that happened, it threw the plaintiffs\u2019 personal finances into chaos. Often, people who qualify for entry into the 120-month loan forgiveness pipeline are in income-based repayment plans that don\u2019t even cover all the interest that accrues each month. As a result, their balances grow over time instead of shrink. Borrowers, though, tend to put their heads down and live with it, knowing that loan forgiveness (which does not come with any income tax liability in this instance) is on the horizon.In defending itself, the Education Department had argued that a letter stating that an employer was eligible, in response to the submission of an individual\u2019s certification form, \u201cdoes not reflect a final agency action on the borrower\u2019s qualifications\u201d for loan forgiveness.In practice, teachers, police officers and other government workers and employees of nonprofit 501(c)3 organizations did not have to worry, since their eligibility was clear in the law. But employees of other types of nonprofit groups were not always certain about the status of their employers.In this case, the judge began by plainly stating his disagreement with the department\u2019s assertion that the certification response letters to borrowers were not definitive. \u201cThe language of the denial letters demonstrates that they marked the department\u2019s final determination,\u201d he wrote, pointing to \u201cdefinitive\u201d and \u201cunambiguous\u201d language.The judge also ruled that when it came to the three lawyers who prevailed in this case \u2014 Geoffrey Burkhart, Michelle Quintero-Millan and Kate Voigt \u2014 the department had changed two of its policies without properly informing borrowers or considering the impact on the borrowers who were relying on its original guidance. One policy determines whether public service is an organization\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose,\u201d and the other relates to whether educational services are provided in a \u201cschool-like setting.\u201d\u201cDefendants argue that the denial letters did not have \u2018an immediate or significant practical effect\u2019 on the individual plaintiffs because their \u2018eligibility for P.S.L.F. had not yet been finally determined,\u2019\u201d the judge wrote. The judge said this was \u201cnonsense,\u201d since the borrowers\u2019 loan balances were spiraling upward and they might have needed to change jobs if their current employment was not eligible for loan forgiveness.As a result of the ruling, the three borrowers who won the case and all others like them now have grounds to petition the Education Department to have their eligibility reinstated. The department\u2019s press office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.There was a fourth plaintiff, Jamie Rudert, and he did not get a favorable ruling. His issue involved a different standard: whether his work for paralyzed veterans was at an organization that provides services \u201coutright\u201d and whether that ought to matter. The judge ruled that the \u201coutright standard\u201d was an appropriate reading of the program\u2019s rules and that its use in this instance had not represented any actual policy change.Chong Park, a lawyer at Ropes & Gray who represented the plaintiffs, said in an interview that he did not agree with the judge\u2019s ruling in the fourth case. He and that client would consider their next steps in the coming days."}, {"title": "Larry Hogan, Maryland Governor, Urges Republicans to Look Beyond \u2018Shrinking Base\u2019", "category": "Politics", "id": "c5ddfd0c-e166-4e87-a56b-5a35bd39be4e", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/us/politics/larry-hogan-trump-2020.html", "publishdate": 20190223, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/us/24hogan/merlin_149994039_85e2f814-372c-4827-bfa2-86f08ac9a62a-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Gov.

Citing his own performance in the midterm elections, when he won re-election handily in a racially diverse blue state, Mr. Hogan suggested he was the kind of leader who could broaden the party\u2019s appeal.\u201cI think there are a lot of Republicans that are concerned about the future and that want us to continue to be a bigger tent and to reach a wider audience and to not alienate people and not to be as divisive,\u201d Mr. Hogan said.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]But Mr. Hogan also indicated that he diverges from much of the Republican base on important matters besides his unfavorable view of Mr. Trump. He criticized Republicans in Congress for having tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act without proposing a suitable alternative and declined to express a personal assessment of whether the Senate had been right to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.And asked whether he believed Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal nationwide, had been correctly decided by the court, Mr. Hogan replied in the affirmative: \u201cI think so.\u201dMr. Hogan has said in the past that he is personally opposed to abortion but pledged not to try to impose restrictions on the procedure as governor.Of Justice Kavanaugh, Mr. Hogan said he was satisfied that the confirmation process had been carried out properly but said he did not see it as his role to weigh in on the suitability of Supreme Court nominees.\u201cThe president appoints, the Senate confirms, they had a hearing,\u201d Mr. Hogan said. \u201cI\u2019m not a part of it.\u201dMr. Hogan said that if he were to run against Mr. Trump, they would \u201cdiffer quite a bit\u201d on policy, though he allowed that there would be areas of overlap. He has branded himself in Maryland as a fiscal conservative focused on job creation and economic development, and he noted that in some respects his economic ideas would match those of the president.\u201cOn the economic issues, some of it might be fairly similar, and I think he\u2019s done a fairly decent job on the economy,\u201d Mr. Hogan said, before adding: \u201cWe might differ on trade, we might differ on many other things.\u201dMr. Hogan said he had no timeline for deciding on a presidential campaign, but noted that winning candidates in the past have waited until \u201clate summer or early fall\u201d to launch their candidacies.Another moderate Republican from the East, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, has already taken steps to oppose Mr. Trump in the primaries and announced the creation of an exploratory committee this month.So far, Mr. Trump has opted not to go after Mr. Hogan personally, despite the president\u2019s tendency to unleash ferocious retribution on dissident figures in his own party. Mr. Hogan said Mr. Trump maintained that restraint in a speech he gave to Republican governors on Friday night.\u201cHe spoke for an hour and 10 or 15 minutes, off script, and didn\u2019t mention me,\u201d Mr. Hogan said. \u201cSo, I was kind of pleased.\u201d"}, {"title": "Kraft Heinz, the U.S. Budget, and Big Stock Losses Feature in Warren Buffett\u2019s Letter", "category": "Business", "id": "a96710dc-0b31-4d77-8d30-2d6fb686cb55", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/business/dealbook/buffett-annual-letter-berkshire.html", "publishdate": 20190223, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/01/business/01-OXY-02-PRINT/merlin_150945636_b5529a29-9d5c-4837-abf8-b3d8ed1ce9b1-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The stock market rout that occurred at the end of last year hurt Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s 2018 profits, at least on paper.The conglomerate controlled by Warren E. Buffett suffered losses of $25.4 billion in the fourth quarter, according to Berkshire\u2019s annual report that was released on Saturday. The company owns $173 billion of stocks and the market\u2019s swoon in the fourth quarter helped cause losses of $22.7 billion on those securities. Berkshire also recorded a $3 billion noncash loss related to its large stake in Kraft Heinz, the struggling food company. (Stocks, of course, have recovered this year, and Berkshire\u2019s losses may now be smaller.)In his annual letter to Berkshire\u2019s shareholders that accompanied its results, Mr. Buffett urged investors to focus on the performance of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s broad array of companies, which includes insurers, energy firms, railways and manufacturers. These firms did well last year, posting a 36 percent increase in earnings.Before 2018, Berkshire did not include the performance of its stock holdings in its income statement, unless it sold the shares. But a new accounting rule requires that the company include the paper gains and losses. That is something Mr. Buffett has criticized, saying the rule would cause \u201cwild and capricious\u201d swings in Berkshire\u2019s bottom line. In this year\u2019s letter, he wrote, \u201cIndeed, in the fourth quarter, a period of high volatility in stock prices, we experienced several days with a \u2018profit\u2019 or \u2018loss\u2019 of more than $4 billion.\u201dProblems at Kraft Heinz, which on Thursday reported weak fourth-quarter earnings and a $15.4 billion write-down, also weighed on Berkshire, which owns a nearly 27 percent stake in the food company.If Kraft, among Berkshire\u2019s biggest holdings, fails to revive its business, Mr. Buffett\u2019s reputation as a savvy investor could take a hit. His partner in the food maker, a Brazilian investment firm called 3G Capital, has pursued a strict cost-cutting strategy that may now be showing diminishing returns.Here\u2019s a look at some of the other highlights from the letter:What to do with all its cash? BuybacksBerkshire joined the buyback boom last year, modestly.The company bought back $418 million of its own shares during the final three months of 2018, bringing its total for the year to just over $1.3 billion.That activity will probably continue. \u201cIt is likely that \u2014 over time \u2014 Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in his letter to shareholders.Flush with cash from the $1.5 trillion tax cut, American companies bought back almost $800 billion of their own stock last year, a record amount. By reducing the number of shares outstanding, the buybacks can help boost the companies\u2019 stock prices. And companies often buy back their shares when they believe they have nothing better to do with their money than return capital to shareholders.There are signs of that at Berkshire. Over the years, Mr. Buffett has mostly avoided repurchasing Berkshire\u2019s shares, arguing that he could generate better returns for shareholders through investments.But as the price to acquire big companies has risen in recent years, Berkshire hasn\u2019t made any big deals. That has led Mr. Buffett, who in the past has disparaged corporate buybacks, to consider repurchasing Berkshire\u2019s stock.This summer, Berkshire lifted its restrictions on the price at which price Mr. Buffett could buy back shares. In the third quarter, it bought back $928 million worth.So far, Berkshire\u2019s buyback spending has been fairly modest, and in his letter, Mr. Buffett warned of caution in the future.\u201cObviously, repurchases should be price-sensitive: Blindly buying an overpriced stock is value destructive, a fact lost on many promotional or ever-optimistic C.E.O.s,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote.Berkshire vs. the S&P 500ImageOne of Mr. Buffett\u2019s goals each year is to beat the S&P 500 stock market index. Last year, Berkshire did.In 2018, the company\u2019s book value rose 0.4 percent and its stock price climbed 2.8 percent. By comparison, the S&P 500 lost 4.4 percent, counting dividends.For years, Mr. Buffett\u2019s preferred measure of Berkshire\u2019s performance was the company\u2019s book value as compared with the S&P 500, and he would highlight the annual rise and fall of both on a table in the letter.But beating the S&P 500 became more difficult as Berkshire grew and shifted to buying whole companies. In 2014, Mr. Buffett added the annual performance of Berkshire\u2019s stock price to the table.\u201cThe fact is that the annual change in Berkshire\u2019s book value \u2014 which makes its farewell appearance on page 2 \u2014 is a metric that has lost the relevance it once had,\u201d Mr. Buffett wrote in this year\u2019s letter.Why no deal making?Berkshire has grown by spending large chunks of money to acquire other companies. That remains part of its long-term plan, according to Mr. Buffett\u2019s letter, but the current business climate means that it\u2019s temporarily on hiatus.\u201cIn the years ahead,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire will permanently own. The immediate prospects for that, however, are not good: Prices are sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects.And if you were in any doubt about Mr. Buffett\u2019s appetite for huge deals, he paints a vivid picture about just how much he\u2019d like to bag one.\u201cWe continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven at our ages of 88 and 95 \u2014 I\u2019m the young one \u2014 that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlie\u2019s to beat faster. (Just writing about the possibility of a huge purchase has caused my pulse rate to soar.)\u201dDon\u2019t fret the United States\u2019 budget deficitMr. Buffett also seems to have become more relaxed about the federal budget deficit, which has recently been getting bigger.In the 2018 annual report, he wrote: \u201cThose who regularly preach doom because of government budget deficits (as I regularly did myself for many years) might note that our country\u2019s national debt has increased roughly 400-fold during the last of my 77-year periods.\u201dInvestors buying gold to try and protect themselves from the rising debt and the prospect of ballooning deficits would have made a mere fraction of what they would have earned in the United States stock market over the 77 year period, Mr. Buffett noted. (Mr. Buffett first invested in an American business 77 years ago.)\u201cThe magical metal was no match for the American mettle,\u201d he said in the report.Succession plans remain a secretEvery year, investors carefully read Mr. Buffett\u2019s letter for clues about Berkshire\u2019s succession plans. They didn\u2019t get any on Saturday.Mr. Buffett did, however, champion his two most senior lieutenants. At the start of 2018, Berkshire Hathaway promoted two of its longtime executives, Gregory E. Abel and Ajit Jain, to oversee the company\u2019s businesses. Mr. Abel became vice chairman of the conglomerate\u2019s non-insurance businesses; Mr. Jain is vice chairman of Berkshire\u2019s insurance operations.In his letter on Saturday, Mr. Buffett said this: \u201cI want to give you some good news \u2014 really good news \u2014 that is not reflected in our financial statements. It concerns the management changes we made in early 2018, when Ajit Jain was put in charge of all insurance activities and Greg Abel was given authority over all other operations. These moves were overdue. Berkshire is now far better managed than when I alone was supervising operations. Ajit and Greg have rare talents, and Berkshire blood flows through their veins.\u201dQuips and quotesMr. Buffett\u2019s annual letter has become known for its investment advice and folksy wisdom as well as a few corny jokes. Here are some of the best lines from this year\u2019s. (The Charlie they mention is Charles T. Munger, Mr. Buffett\u2019s vice-chairman at Berkshire Hathaway.)On accounting fraud: \u201cOver the years, Charlie and I have seen all sorts of bad corporate behavior, both accounting and operational, induced by the desire of management to meet Wall Street expectations. What starts as an \u2018innocent\u2019 fudge in order to not disappoint \u2018the Street\u2019 \u2014 say, trade-loading at quarter-end, turning a blind eye to rising insurance losses, or drawing down a \u2018cookie-jar\u2019 reserve \u2014 can become the first step toward full-fledged fraud. Playing with the numbers \u2018just this once\u2019 may well be the C.E.O.\u2019s intent; it\u2019s seldom the end result.\u201dOn paying tax: \u201cBegin with an economic reality: Like it or not, the U.S. Government \u2018owns\u2019 an interest in Berkshire\u2019s earnings of a size determined by Congress. In effect, our country\u2019s Treasury Department holds a special class of our stock \u2014 call this holding the AA shares \u2014 that receives large \u2018dividends\u2019 (that is, tax payments) from Berkshire. In 2017, as in many years before, the corporate tax rate was 35 percent, which meant that the Treasury was doing very well with its AA shares.\u201dOn using debt: \u201cMany managers, it should be noted, will disagree with this policy, arguing that significant debt juices the returns for equity owners. And these more venturesome C.E.O.s will be right most of the time. At rare and unpredictable intervals, however, credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian roulette equation \u2014 usually win, occasionally die \u2014 may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of a company\u2019s upside but does not share in its downside. But that strategy would be madness for Berkshire. Rational people don\u2019t risk what they have and need for what they don\u2019t have and don\u2019t need.\u201d"}, {"title": "China\u2019s Entrepreneurs Are Wary of Its Future", "category": "Business", "id": "489e9998-1206-48fe-80fb-e715a90e68bc", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/23/business/china-entrepreneurs-confidence.html", "publishdate": 20190223, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/business/24newworld-print1/merlin_150190305_38376aa3-4802-4d5b-b71d-354b1c1bf77b-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Chen Tianyong, a Chinese real estate developer in Shanghai, boarded a flight to Malta last month with no plans to return anytime soon.After landing, Mr. Chen, a former judge and lawyer, shared on social media a 28-page article explaining himself. \u201cWhy I Left China,\u201d read the headline, \u201cAn Entrepreneur\u2019s Farewell Admonition.\u201d\u201cChina\u2019s economy is like a giant ship heading to the precipice,\u201d Mr. Chen wrote. \u201cWithout fundamental changes, it\u2019s inevitable that the ship will be wrecked and the passengers will die.\u201d \u201cMy friends,\u201d he urged, \u201cif you can leave, please make arrangements as early as possible.\u201dIt is unclear how many people saw the article before it disappeared from China\u2019s heavily censored internet. But Mr. Chen said publicly what many businesspeople in China are saying privately: China\u2019s leadership has mismanaged the world\u2019s second-largest economy, and China\u2019s entrepreneur class is losing confidence in the country\u2019s future. For more than a generation, China has been fueled by optimism that, despite its problems, tomorrow will be better than today. Now, the prevailing view is best summed up by an online meme made popular by Wang Xing, the founder and chief executive of Meituan Dianping, the online delivery and takeout company. The year 2019, goes the meme, may be the worst year in this decade, but it will be the best year in the next decade.China\u2019s economy is slowing, and the trade war with the United States has pinched growth. But many entrepreneurs are more broadly worried that China won\u2019t pursue the economic and political liberalization it needs. On the contrary, since Xi Jinping took control of the Communist Party in 2012, the party has increased its dominance in every aspect of Chinese society.Few are predicting a crash, but worries over China\u2019s long-term prospects are growing. Pessimism is so high, in fact, that some businesspeople are comparing China\u2019s potential future to another country where the government seized control of the economy and didn\u2019t ease up: Venezuela. Only one-third of China\u2019s rich people say they are very confident in the country\u2019s economic prospects, according to a recent survey of 465 wealthy individuals by Hurun, a Shanghai-based research firm. Two years ago, nearly two-thirds said they were very confident. Those who have no confidence at all rose to 14 percent, more than double the level of 2018. Nearly half said they were considering migrating to a foreign country or had already started the process.\u201cChina is facing a lot of internal and external challenges now,\u201d said Fred Hu, founder of the investment firm Primavera Capital Group and former head of Goldman Sachs\u2019s Greater China business. \u201cWe need to realize that all of our achievements in the past 40 years were the results of opening up and economic reform, not because of any unique China development model.\u201dMr. Hu\u2019s comments are diplomatic. In private, some businesspeople are talking in angrier and more fearful ways. They asked for anonymity, of course. In today\u2019s tightly controlled environment in China, even the economy \u2014 once considered a safe subject \u2014 has become dangerous to talk about. \u201cThe most important cause of their pessimism is bad policy and bad leadership,\u201d said Minxin Pei, a professor at Claremont McKenna College in California who is in frequent contact with business figures. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to the private businesspeople that the moment the government doesn\u2019t need them, it\u2019ll slaughter them like pigs. This is not a government that respects the law. It can change on a dime.\u201dMany members of the business elite are unhappy that the leadership\u2019s economic policies favor state-owned enterprises even though the private sector drives growth. They are angry that the party is trying to put a Mao-era ideological straitjacket on an economy driven by private enterprises and young consumers. They are upset that the party eliminated term limits last year, raising the prospect that Mr. Xi could become president for life. Many businesspeople feel increasingly insecure, especially as some entrepreneurs are \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the government to assist in the anticorruption campaigns.\u201cIn the eyes of some senior officials, even people like Jack Ma and Pony Ma are just small-time businessmen,\u201d Mr. Chen said in an interview, referring to the founders of Alibaba and Tencent, two of China\u2019s biggest private enterprises.Mr. Xi appears to be aware of the unease. Beijing has postponed new rules that would raise business taxes to pay for social benefits and has eased its monetary and fiscal policies. ImageMr. Chen said he had decided to move to Malta because it was warm, beautiful and a member of the European Union, easing his travel within the bloc.CreditGianni Cipriano for The New York TimesStill, the party\u2019s priorities appear to be elsewhere. In his December speech commemorating 40 years of China\u2019s opening, Mr. Xi argued that his recipe of guided growth under strong Communist Party control must not waver. In another important speech to the party\u2019s top officials last month, Mr. Xi identified seven major risks for national security, with politics and ideology topping the list, and he called for tighter control of young people and the internet.China\u2019s power structure lacks a way to counterbalance this trend. A few young hedge fund managers told me over dinner in Hong Kong that the trade war with President Trump could be a blessing in disguise because it might force Beijing to undertake structural reforms to reach a deal. Only Mr. Trump can save China, it is often said at private gatherings, only half-jokingly.\u201cThe trade war is a bad thing to begin with,\u201d said Mr. Hu of Primavera Capital. \u201cBut if the final resolutions lead to renewed efforts by China to undertake broad structural reforms, it will be a win-win situation for the U.S., China and the world.\u201dThe relationship between the business elite and the party wasn\u2019t always like this. Some businesspeople cheered Mr. Xi when he came to power, his anticorruption crackdown signaling to them that he was building a rules-based society. But disillusioned executives told me that tighter government control means more bureaucrats have a say in business matters, and corruption simply takes different forms.Can it be stopped? Some businesspeople are pessimistic. Mr. Chen, the real estate developer, says the solution is to leave.It\u2019s impossible to say how many people agree. Even those who have left China may still run businesses there, making them reluctant to speak out. Plus, the country still has many optimists who say this rough patch won\u2019t last.But many of China\u2019s rich have been voting with their feet. The number of Chinese people moving to the United States on investor visas has surged in recent years. Of the one million foreign students in the United States, one-third are from China.Now 53, Mr. Chen decided in early 2013 that he had better start looking at places outside mainland China. The trigger was a widely circulated party directive that urged an offensive against liberal political ideas and values. \u201cIt was a very terrifying signal,\u201d he said.He first secured permanent resident status in Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, but concerns about its autonomy have grown since Beijing responded fiercely to pro-democracy protests there in 2014. He applied for the investor visa to the United States, but the wait time was too long.He then bought more than a dozen apartments in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, and urged his relatives and close friends to do the same. He called it his Noah\u2019s Ark plan, to prepare for the destructive flood that China might experience. But his Malaysia visa was valid for only 10 years.Mr. Chen said he had finally settled on Malta because it was warm, beautiful and a member of the European Union, which meant he would be able to travel to other countries in the bloc.For the entrepreneur class, he said, leaving China is the best way to resist Communist rule. Once people leave, they will manage to take at least some assets with them despite the strict capital controls the government has imposed in recent years. They can come back when the circumstances change, Mr. Chen said, much like many overseas Chinese did in the 1980s and \u201990s. Mr. Chen is learning English and exploring his interest in religion. He still has some businesses in China but doesn\u2019t need to tend to them in person. He said he had never really considered changing his citizenship because life was tough for first-generation immigrants. He only wanted to find a safe place for his family, he said, to protect against a worst-case scenario that he believes will materialize unless there\u2019s a miracle.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect my article would be circulated so widely,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the time being, it might be best that I stay out of China.\u201d"}, {"title": "Trump Delays a Tariff Deadline, Citing Progress in China Trade Talks", "category": "Business", "id": "a38ca36c-3ae1-4974-b4f1-7d00bde4d253", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/us/politics/us-china-trade-truce.html", "publishdate": 20190224, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/us/politics/24dc-chinatrade/merlin_151070997_fbdd1dae-776a-4f67-98ee-be0812872844-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump delayed his own deadline to increase tariffs on Chinese goods on Sunday as his administration continues a monthslong effort to persuade Beijing to make significant structural changes to its economy that have so far proved elusive.Mr. Trump, in a tweet on Sunday, said he would delay a Friday deadline to increase tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports, citing \u201csubstantial progress\u201d during a week of trade talks in Washington between American and Chinese officials.The president, who has been eager to cut a deal with Beijing, said the negotiators had forged a compromise on key issues, including China\u2019s requirement that American companies hand over valuable intellectual property and technology as a condition of doing business in China, as well as more purchases of American agriculture and energy products, like liquid natural gas.But in a hint of how fluid the talks remain, the two sides did not sign an official agreement and the White House did not release details on any agreements. Mr. Trump said he hoped to sign a final deal in person in a meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, most likely in March at Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s Palm Beach resort, but no new deadline was set.\u201cAs a result of these very productive talks, I will be delaying the U.S. increase in tariffs now scheduled for March 1,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cAssuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself, at Mar-a-Lago, to conclude an agreement. A very good weekend for U.S. & China!\u201dThe extension will prevent the United States from increasing tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese exports to 25 percent from 10 percent on March 2. The delay, which Mr. Trump had dangled as a possibility in recent weeks, is likely to calm volatile financial markets and reassure business owners who depend on China both for components and as a market for finished goods. Investors in China cheered the news, sending its stock market up more than 5 percent.Despite the progress touted by Mr. Trump, the Chinese have still yet to make written commitments to any of the core issues that the president mentioned in his tweet, according to a person familiar with the negotiations.After a long weekend of talks, this person said, the Chinese delegation returned to the Chinese embassy in Washington and, over secure communications, received permission from Beijing to make a commitment in principle to satisfy the American negotiators and Mr. Trump.An American delegation is expected to travel to Beijing sometime between now and Mr. Xi\u2019s trip to Mar-a-Lago to continue to work out the remaining differences. The fact that Mr. Xi has agreed to come to Mar-a-Lago is viewed by the Chinese as a concession, as they originally hoped that such a meeting would take place on China\u2019s Hainan island. But the location also represents a gamble by Mr. Trump, who could be faced with an awkward situation if Mr. Xi refuses to make final concessions while he is a guest at his resort.Mr. Trump continued to tease the prospect of a potential deal with China on Sunday evening, saying \u201cif all works well, we\u2019re going to have some very big news over the next week or two.\u201dThe president said tariffs on Chinese goods had helped propel the United States beyond China, saying \u201cas long as I\u2019m president, they\u2019re not going to catch us.\u201dWhile some analysts said Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers appeared likely to secure greater concessions than past administrations have achieved, others remain skeptical that United States can significantly transform the economic relationship with China.The president\u2019s announcement followed days of negotiations in which American and Chinese officials met in board rooms near the White House to work line-by-line through a handful of documents covering intellectual property, services and subsidies. The Chinese were ready to commit to billions of dollars of purchases of American soybeans, beef, natural gas and other products, though they have resisted more structural changes to their economy.Mr. Trump has long criticized China for undercutting American workers, and his advisers have tried to pressure the country into making firm commitments to protect American intellectual property, give foreign companies equal access to Chinese markets and reduce subsidies to state-owned firms. But some of these goals run counter to China\u2019s own ambitions of cementing the Communist Party\u2019s control over the economy and the economic dominance of its state-owned firms.One component of this week\u2019s agreement was a pledge by China not to artificially weaken the value of its heavily managed currency, according to people with knowledge of the negotiations. A weaker currency would make Chinese products cheaper abroad and lessen the impact of American tariffs. Under the agreement reached this week, the Chinese must notify the United States when and why they are intervening in their currency. If they violate the agreement, the Trump administration would ratchet up tariffs on Chinese goods, according to one person with knowledge of the negotiations.Brad Setser, a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the currency commitment made sense in light of the Trump administration\u2019s goal of lowering the gap between what the United States sells to China and what it imports. That so-called trade deficit in goods totaled $382 billion in 2018.\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can credibly try to bring the bilateral deficit down if China doesn\u2019t make a commitment to resist further depreciation,\u201d Mr. Setser said. \u201cA weaker yuan encourages U.S. firms to import more from China, it makes U.S. exports in China more expensive, and this would work against the administration\u2019s goal of a more balanced trading relationship.\u201dThe two sides do not appear to have agreed to a mechanism that would enforce any deal, but American negotiators have favored requiring tariffs on Chinese goods to snap back if Beijing does not make good on the agreement.\u201cMy guess is that the Trump administration prefers the simplest, most unilateral approach that makes it easy for them to be judge and jury,\u201d Scott Kennedy, a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Relations, said of the enforcement mechanism.The tariffs against China are just one front in a global trade war that the president has initiated since coming into office. In a series of trade actions last year, the Trump administration levied tariffs on roughly 13 percent of total American imports, including solar products, washing machines and metals, according to Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.As the Chinese negotiators prepared to return to Beijing on Monday, industry representatives were struggling to understand the status of the talks and evaluate the effect on their businesses.Business owners and lobbyists have generally agreed with some of the administration\u2019s goals, including fighting for more equal treatment for foreign companies operating in China. But they have disagreed with the use of tariffs as leverage \u2014 since that tends to hurt American importers and their customers \u2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on the bilateral trade deficit.While the United States and China seem nearer to an agreement than in previous months, companies that operate in China have not been released from uncertainty. Mr. Trump views trade as one of his signature issues, and his advisers say that, when it comes to a final deal, the president will be the one to decide if it passes muster.Mr. Trump has often weighed in at the last minute to change the terms in past negotiations, imposing tariffs or lifting sanctions based on personal conversations with foreign leaders or perceived compliments or slights.\u201cThe president has undercut, privately or publicly, every one of his trade representatives,\u201d said William Reinsch, a former United States trade official and now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cThe president is his own trade representative and he\u2019s going to make the decisions.\u201dIn the Oval Office on Friday, Mr. Trump contradicted his top trade adviser in front of TV cameras about whether the agreement should be termed a \u201cmemorandum of understanding,\u201d a phrase Mr. Trump said was not forceful enough.Still, the president was upbeat. Mr. Trump in a tweet called the talks \u201cvery productive.\u201dThe lack of detail about what the United States and China may agree to is prompting concern from both Republicans and Democrats, who worry that Mr. Trump may sign a deal that does little to change many of the practices that American companies say put them \u2014 and their workers \u2014 at a competitive disadvantage.Lawmakers will get a chance to grill the administration about its plans this week when Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade adviser, testifies about the China talks and other trade actions on Wednesday.For now, Republicans are portraying the delay as a positive.\u201cEncouraging news from @POTUS that progress is being made in a trade deal with China,\u201d Representative Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, tweeted. \u201cHopefully this leads to an agreement that stops China\u2019s theft of US intellectual property and avoids a full blown trade war.\u201dComplications could still arise, however, including China\u2019s importance in helping the United States negotiate with North Korea. The Chinese have assisted the Trump administration in arranging another summit meeting with Kim Jong-un in Hanoi this week and Mr. Trump has often cited Mr. Xi\u2019s relationship with Mr. Kim, which has put Mr. Trump in the awkward position of depending on China\u2019s assistance while also trying to play tough and win a trade deal.\u201cPresident Xi of China has been very helpful in his support of my meeting with Kim Jong Un,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday. \u201cThe last thing China wants are large scale nuclear weapons right next door. Sanctions placed on the border by China and Russia have been very helpful.

Voice scans that detect hogs with a cough. Robots that dispense just the right amount of feed. This could be China\u2019s pig farm of the future.Chinese companies are pushing facial and voice recognition and other advanced technologies as ways to protect the country\u2019s pigs. In this Year of the Pig, many Chinese hogs are dying from a deadly swine disease, threatening the country\u2019s supply of pork, a staple of Chinese dinner tables. So China\u2019s ebullient technology sector is applying the same techniques it has used to transform Chinese life \u2014 and, more darkly, that the Chinese government increasingly uses to spy on its own people \u2014 to make sure its pigs are in the pink of health. \u201cIf they are not happy, and not eating well, in some cases you can predict whether the pig is sick,\u201d said Jackson He, chief executive officer of Yingzi Technology, a small firm based in the southern city of Guangzhou that has introduced its vision of a \u201cfuture pig farm\u201d with facial and voice recognition technologies.China\u2019s biggest tech firms want to pamper pigs, too. Alibaba, the e-commerce giant, and JD.com, its rival, are using cameras to track pigs\u2019 faces. Alibaba also uses voice-recognition software to monitor their coughs. Many in China are quick to embrace high-tech solutions to just about any problem. A digital revolution has transformed China into a place where nearly anything \u2014 financial services, spicy takeout, manicures and dog grooming, to name a few \u2014 can be summoned with a smartphone. Facial recognition has been deployed in public bathrooms to dispense toilet paper, in train stations to apprehend criminals and in housing complexes to open doors. This pig push, however, may be a step too soon.\u201cI like the idea, I like the concept, but I need to be shown that it works,\u201d said Dirk Pfeiffer, a professor of veterinary epidemiology at the City University of Hong Kong. \u201cBecause if it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s counterproductive.\u201dFacial recognition won\u2019t help unless China has a comprehensive database of pig faces to track their movement, he pointed out. Also, facial recognition doesn\u2019t help \u201conce the animal is in the slaughterhouse and they chop it into bits.\u201d \u201cHow then can you connect the head to the rest of the carcass?\u201d Professor Pfeiffer asked.Many of China\u2019s pig farmers are also skeptical. China is in the midst of closing and consolidating many of its small pig farms, blaming them for polluting the environment. But there are still 26 million small pig farms in the country, representing about half the number of farms, according to the agriculture ministry and experts.\u201cWe will not choose to invest in these things,\u201d said Wang Wenjun, a 27-year-old farmer who won a modest amount of fame after he uploaded videos of himself singing to his hogs. \u201cUnless it\u2019s a large-scale pig farm, farms that have just over a couple hundred pigs will not find a use for it.\u201dBroadly, the Chinese government in recent years has endorsed technology on the farm. Its most recent five-year plan, a major economic planning document, calls for increased use of robotics and network technology. In October, the State Council, or China\u2019s cabinet, said it wanted to promote \u201cintelligent farming\u201d and the application of information technology in agriculture. In August, Beijing city agricultural officials praised \u201craising pigs in a smart way\u201d using the A-B-C-Ds: artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing and data technology.So when African swine fever swept through China\u2019s farms, the country\u2019s technology companies saw an opportunity. The disease has no known vaccine or cure. It can spread through contact between animals or through infected pig products, meaning it can lurk for months in sausages or ham. It doesn\u2019t affect humans, but they can carry it. China has culled nearly a million pigs, set up roadblocks and built fences, to no avail.There\u2019s a lot at stake. China is the world\u2019s largest pig breeder, with a current population of about 400 million, and its largest pork consumer. The meat is so important that the country has its own strategic pork reserve in the event of a shortage. The disease could also ripple across borders. It has been found in sausages transported by Chinese tourists in Australia, Taiwan, Japan and Thailand, stoking fears that it could end up in the United States. A prolonged outbreak could cause prices to rise globally.ImageYingzi uses video to capture pig faces because they move a lot. \u201cYou can\u2019t take a single picture of a pig,\u201d said Jackson He, the company's C.E.O.CreditYingzi TechnologyGovernment rules to fight the swine fever prevent outsiders from visiting pig farms to see the technology in action, so claims by the companies couldn\u2019t be independently verified. Local media and the companies said several big farms use the systems. The companies backing the technology say they can help farmers isolate disease carriers, reduce the cost of feed, increase the fertility of sows and reduce unnatural deaths. JD.com\u2019s system uses robots to feed pigs the correct amount of food depending on the animals\u2019 stage of growth. SmartAHC, a company that uses A.I. to monitors pigs\u2019 vital statistics that offers commercially available services, hooks up sows with wearable monitors that can predict the pigs\u2019 ovulation time.They pitch their technologies as an alternative to the tagging of pigs\u2019 ears, a practice that many farmers find cruel. The tags \u2014 which are far cheaper \u2014 can be manipulated by humans or fall off if pigs get into fights, they point out.JD.com\u2019s facial technology can detect if a pig is sick and try to find out why, said a spokeswoman, Lu Yishan. Its system would then notify the breeder, who can then prescribe treatment. The company said that it has put the system into use at a farm in China\u2019s northern Hebei Province that it created with China Agricultural University in Beijing, and that it is for sale to willing farmers.Alibaba\u2019s system monitors hog activity and allows farmers to track the swine in real time, the company said in a statement. It would then prescribe an exercise plan to improve their health. Its marketing video shows pigs running in the woods and playing with a ball. Alibaba said Tequ Group, a large pig farming company based in the southwestern province of Sichuan, uses the technology. Tequ didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Pig facial recognition works the same way as human facial recognition, the companies say. Scanners and software take in the bristles, the snout, the eyes and ears. The features are mapped. Pigs don\u2019t all look alike when you know what to look for, they said.\u201cIt\u2019s just like how a human face is different from others,\u201d said Mr. He, of Yingzi.The pigs don\u2019t always cooperate. Yingzi, which introduced its products commercially last year, uses video to capture them in motion.ImageSmartAHC, a Chinese farm technology company, uses monitors embedded in pigs' ears to track their body temperature, exercise and other information. CreditSmartAHCImageSmartAHC's system gives each pig a number and tracks how far it walks each day.CreditSmartAHC\u201cYou can\u2019t take a single picture of a pig,\u201d said Mr. He, who is trying to add to his database of more than 200,000 pig images. He said his technology, which is being used in a pig farm in the southern region of Guangxi, won\u2019t eliminate swine fever but could help farmers detect it sooner.Not everybody in the pig technology field agrees on approach. Chen Haokai, the co-founder of SmartAHC, said farmers don\u2019t really need facial recognition. According to Mr. Chen, the cost of trying to map a pig\u2019s face is about $7 versus $0.30 for tagging a pig\u2019s ear. He said his products are used by four pig breeding companies. \u201cWe found that in trying to capture the faces of pigs, the labor cost far exceeds that of tagging,\u201d he said.Wang Lixian, a research fellow of animal and veterinary science at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, is optimistic that the cost of the technologies will drop. \u201cRight now, these applications may not have reached their desired levels,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in the future they will become more and more extensive.\u201d"}, {"title": "When the Waiting Room Is Your Living Room", "category": "Business", "id": "b75b6024-0308-4b46-9a81-4e8c3858ac4e", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/business/on-demand-health-care-delivery.html", "publishdate": 20190224, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/25/business/25ONDEMAND1-print/merlin_149658222_97eacbb0-6733-4c2f-b22e-a2471591ce57-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Businesses can deliver everything on demand, from dinner to dry cleaning. Some will even show up at your door to give you cupcakes or walk your dog. Now, entrepreneurs are exploring a growing niche: health care.Start-ups are offering access to doctors, prescription drugs and wellness programs as fast and easy as hailing an Uber driver. Experts say this is the early stages of a movement that could disrupt the health services industry, which critics have long contended suffers from soaring costs and reduced access to care. Seven in 10 Americans in a recent Gallup poll said they believed health care was \u201cin a state of crisis\u201d or had \u201cmajor problems.\u201d\u201cHealth care delivery is so broken that we need to explore new channels \u2014 new conduits \u2014 and this represents one of them,\u201d said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the author of \u201cThe Patient Will See You Now.\u201dThe on-demand economy, which offers consumers immediate access to goods and services, surged 58 percent in 2017 from the previous year to an estimated $75.7 billion, according to a study by Rockbridge Associates, a market research firm.As the industry swells, dozens of health and wellness companies are tapping the trend.Heal, DispatchHealth, MedZed, Dose Healthcare and Pager will send a doctor or a nurse practitioner to a person\u2019s home or workplace to treat nonemergency problems like strep throat or a sprained ankle. The I.V. Doc offers intravenous treatments for conditions like jet lag, hangovers and food poisoning. And Capsule will deliver prescriptions to a person\u2019s doorstep.\u201cPeople want convenience,\u201d said Josh York, founder of GymGuyz, a \u201cgym on wheels\u201d that sends a trainer and fitness equipment to customers\u2019 homes. \u201cYou could get your pizza delivered but you couldn\u2019t get your workout delivered, and I thought, \u2018This is where the future is going.\u2019\u201dGymGuyz and other start-ups, like the I.V. Doc, were bootstrapped by the founders\u2019 friends and family. But some \u2014 especially on-demand medical companies, like Heal and DispatchHealth \u2014 needed substantial cash to hire doctors, lease vehicles and bring in administrative staff to handle insurance claims.Cue the investors, many of whom are hunting for the next billion-dollar opportunity.Samir M. Patel, a principal and co-founder of IRA Capital, was so impressed with Heal after using it for at-home visits and an annual physical in his office that he became an investor.\u201cTo us, this feels like we\u2019re investing in Uber in 2010,\u201d Mr. Patel said. \u201cThis is going to revolutionize and change the entire health care industry.\u201dUber, a pioneer in the on-demand economy, could be worth as much as $120 billion as it prepares for an initial public offering this year.Heal has raised $70 million from such investors as the former Qualcomm executive chairman Paul Jacobs, Tull Investment Group and the singer Lionel Richie, while DispatchHealth has raised $36 million from such investors as Questa Capital and Alta Partners.But the potential to be the next \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 a start-up valued at $1 billion or more \u2014 has created a crowded field.The popularity of the I.V. Doc prompted a flurry of smaller companies, like IVDrips, Drip Hydration and the Hangover Club/NutriDrip, to offer similar services \u2014 sometimes at cheaper prices. To fend off competition, the I.V. Doc recently expanded to offer injectable drugs, like Botox and Restylane, as well as postoperative care for plastic surgery.Large tech companies are seeking a bigger share of the more than $3 trillion spent annually on health care in the United States. Amazon, which has been making an aggressive push into health care, announced last year that it would buy PillPack, an online service that organizes and delivers prescription medications. Apple and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, have also made significant acquisitions as they accelerate their efforts on new technologies for doctors, patients and consumers.\u201cHealth care is a $3.5 trillion industry \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t want a piece of that?\u201d said Jeff Becker, a senior analyst and health care IT expert at Forrester.But start-ups are facing challenges on their path to financial viability. Because mobility brings extra liability, one of the biggest roadblocks is insurance for themselves. Problems can crop up on the road, like traffic accidents, or in a customer\u2019s home, like an equipment malfunction. Or perhaps a doctor, lacking sufficient equipment, makes an incorrect diagnosis. These headaches can make it difficult for start-ups to find proper protection.Dr. Adam Nadelson, the founder of the I.V. Doc, approached five insurers in 2013 before finally finding one to sign on.\u201cIt was a mixture of them not understanding what we were doing and then some gave us a price that was just outrageous,\u201d he said.Mr. York of GymGuyz had more than 30 meetings over six months to get an insurer before starting his company in 2008.\u201cIt was very very hard; I had to really paint the vision and meet with a lot of people because the business was so different,\u201d Mr. York said. \u201cThe doors were shut on me so hard that my nose was hurting.\u201dInsurance not only protects the company, business owners say, it also covers employees, who take a risk entering a private residence.\u201cWe have walked into a house and somebody had a gun or walked into a yard where there\u2019s a pit bull,\u201d said Dr. Mark Prather, chief executive and co-founder of DispatchHealth. Both DispatchHealth and Heal always send two people to house calls for safety and efficiency.Getting their customers\u2019 health care insurers on board is equally critical, and providers are slowly coming around.Owners who offer medical care contend that their business model will save insurers money because people will seek medical attention sooner if it\u2019s fast, easy and affordable and does not require monthlong waits for an appointment or long waits in a doctor\u2019s office. And they say early detection and treatment could prevent a problem from morphing into a debilitating illness that later requires an emergency room visit or hospitalization. Visits to the E.R. can cost $1,000 to $2,500, Dr. Prather said.Entrepreneurs point out another benefit: Their doctors and nurses can identify health triggers in a patient\u2019s home.A Los Angeles man who had called for a Heal doctor complained of migraine headaches, recalled Nick Desai, a co-founder of Heal. The man had been to eight doctors, had three M.R.I. scans and had tried multiple medications. When the Heal doctor arrived, he noticed black mold.\u201cSo the patient hired a cleaning person to clean the black mold \u2014 and his migraine headaches were gone,\u201d Mr. Desai said.Insurers are beginning to add on-demand services to their plans and even forming managed care partnerships with start-ups to visit people at home with chronic conditions, like hypertension and diabetes. Anthem, Health Net, Blue Shield, Aetna, CareFirst, United Healthcare, Cigna and Medicare are among the insurers that cover Heal visits in many of their P.P.O. plans, Mr. Desai said.As their businesses expand, owners must navigate complex health care regulations, which can vary from state to state.\u201cEvery state acts as their own country, with their own kooky laws, and understanding those rules and regulations costs an obscene amount of money in legal fees to understand how to operate one\u2019s business,\u201d Dr. Nadelson said.Before Amazon bought PillPack, it tried to enter the world of prescription drugs with a deal to acquire a stake in Drugstore.com. But it ran into regulatory challenges, and the effort was derailed. Amazon found a solution in PillPack, which has pharmacy licenses in 50 states and relationships with the major pharmacy benefit managers and insurers.Despite the barriers, experts believe on-demand health services are here to stay.\u201cThis has the potential to be life-altering,\u201d said Dr. Griffin Myers, a co-founder and the chief medical officer at Oak Street Health, a network of primary care practices for people on Medicare."}, {"title": "G.E. to Sell Biopharmaceutical Unit to Danaher for $21.4 Billion", "category": "Business", "id": "3336e1f5-e493-4ebb-a01e-50e573afa98b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/ge-unit-sale-danaher.html", "publishdate": 20190225, "imageurl": "", "content": "General Electric agreed on Monday to sell its biopharmaceutical business to Danaher for about $21.4 billion, as the troubled industrial giant sells off divisions to pay down debt and steady its business.In selling the business, G.E. took another big step in what has become a drastic slimming-down of an American corporate icon.Known for decades as a titan of American business, G.E. has struggled in recent years with a bevy of problems. Under a succession of leaders, the company has announced the sale or spinoff of enormous divisions, whittling down operations like finance and energy.Last summer, G.E. said it planned to spin off its health care division \u2014 including the biopharmaceutical unit, which sells equipment and software to biotechnology companies \u2014 and sell its stake in a big oil field services business, Baker Hughes.That has meant parting with divisions that are performing well. The biopharmaceutical business accounted for about $3 billion of the $20 billion in revenue that G.E.\u2019s health care unit generated last year. But G.E. executives said the biopharma unit was not a core part of its parent division, which focuses on making medical-imaging machines and other equipment for health care providers.H.

Biopharma is renowned for providing best-in-class bioprocessing technologies and solutions.\u201dUnder the terms of the deal, Danaher will pay about $21 billion in cash and assume about $400 million in pension liabilities at the G.E. unit.Investors in G.E. appeared pleased by the news: Shares in the company were up 6.4 percent in trading on Monday, at $10.82. Shares in Danaher were up 8.4 percent, at $123.15.Before heading G.E., Mr. Culp led Danaher until 2015. Mr. Culp\u2019s strategy at Danaher involved a string of acquisitions that bulked up the conglomerate.And the business being sold was part of G.E.\u2019s health care unit, which had been run by Mr. Culp\u2019s predecessor as chief executive, John L.

The Hollywood establishment, excoriated for its longtime exclusion of women and minorities, recognized African-American production design and costume virtuosos for the first time. Asian-American filmmakers were honored. A movie about a gay rock star collected four trophies.\u201cI want to thank the academy for recognizing a film centered around an indigenous woman,\u201d Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n said as he accepted the award for best director for \u201cRoma,\u201d about a domestic worker in Mexico City.But then came \u201cGreen Book.\u201dIn a choice that prompted immediate blowback \u2014 from, among others, the director Spike Lee, who threw up his hands in frustration and started to walk out of the theater \u2014 the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave the best-picture Oscar to a segregation-era buddy film. While admired by some as a feel-good depiction of people uniting against the odds, the movie was criticized by others as a simplistic take on race relations, both woefully retrograde and borderline bigoted.It was the ultimate Lucy-pulling-away-the-football moment for those who had hoped the film academy was going to reveal itself as a definitively progressive organization. That the 2017 selection of \u201cMoonlight\u201d as best picture wasn\u2019t a fluke. That the efforts to diversify its membership \u2014 albeit still 69 percent male and 84 percent white \u2014 had been transformational.Adding to the anger over \u201cGreen Book\u201d were the other choices available. Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was a cultural and commercial phenomenon, shattering a myth about the overseas viability of movies with Afrocentric story lines. \u201cRoma,\u201d a nuanced examination of class that was made by an almost entirely Latino cast and crew, had been showered with honors at the pre-Oscars award shows.And Mr. Lee\u2019s \u201cBlacKkKlansman,\u201d about an African-American police officer who infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan with the help of a Jewish surrogate, was a chance for the academy to recognize one of cinema\u2019s singular, groundbreaking filmmakers \u2014 one who had been repeatedly overlooked in the past.\u201cA lot of people may have allowed their expectations of the academy to become too great,\u201d said Todd Boyd, a cinema and media studies professor at the University of Southern California who focuses on popular culture and race. \u201cWe can see some signs of changes, but there has not been a full transformation.\u201dImage\u201cGreen Book\u201d was made by a team that was predominantly white, including its director and writers.CreditNoel West for The New York Times\u201cGreen Book,\u201d based on a true story, focuses on a working-class Italian-American man (Viggo Mortensen, nominated for best actor) who gets a job as a chauffeur and bodyguard for a gay African-American pianist (Mahershala Ali, who won the Oscar for best supporting actor). As they drive through the South in 1962, the mismatched men begin to realize they have common ground. At one point, they bond over fried chicken.\u201cThe whole story is about love,\u201d Peter Farrelly, the film\u2019s director and one of its writers, said in his best-picture acceptance speech. \u201cIt\u2019s about loving each other despite our differences and finding the truth about who we are. We\u2019re the same people.\u201dThat message resonated with many people, including black cinema standouts like the writer-director John Singleton (\u201cBoyz in the Hood\u201d) and Octavia Spencer, an Oscar winner in 2012 for \u201cThe Help,\u201d who served as a \u201cGreen Book\u201d executive producer. Luminaries like Harry Belafonte and Quincy Jones also endorsed Mr. Farrelly\u2019s film in recent months. Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a revered figure in the civil rights movement, introduced a montage of the movie on Sunday.\u201cGreen Book\u201d received an A-plus grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls and has become a modest hit, collecting $144 million worldwide for Universal Pictures and Participant Media.Frustration over the celebration of \u201cGreen Book\u201d was intensified by the racial makeup of the people who made it. The filmmaking team was predominantly white \u2014 director, writers, lead producers.\u201cGreen Book is an inspirational tale of how we can end racism if everyone, regardless of background, just works together,\u201d Jason O. Gilbert, a television writer and an author, said on Twitter. \u201cSo please welcome the stage the producers of Green Book: 1000 white guys who were all born in 1961.\u201dDespite pre-Oscars backing for \u201cGreen Book,\u201d vocal supporters were hard to find after it won. A half-dozen academy members declined to be interviewed on Monday morning about the film\u2019s victory, including several who supported \u201cGreen Book.\u201d One explained that he did not want to attract \u201cthe Twitter mob.\u201d Several lamented that the Oscars were no longer about movies but rather about advocacy.Mr. Farrelly did not respond to a request for comment.Others in Hollywood spent the day scratching their heads and wondering if \u201cGreen Book\u201d had won simply because it was a studio-backed film. \u201cRoma\u201d was released by Netflix \u2014 largely skipping theaters \u2014 and some voters seemed unready to crown the streaming service.ImageMr. Lee jumped into Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s arms after Mr. Jackson announced his screenplay award.CreditNoel West for The New York TimesIt was also possible that \u201cGreen Book\u201d benefited from the academy\u2019s complicated \u201cpreferential\u201d voting system for best picture, in which nominees are ranked 1 through 8, and the second- and third-place positions can carry as much weight as first place.ImageListen to \u2018The Daily\u2019: What Hollywood Keeps Getting Wrong About RaceWesley Morris joins us to talk about \u201cGreen Book,\u201d the latest in a series of Oscar winners that focus on a white character\u2019s moral journey in an interracial friendship.transcriptBack to The Dailybars0:00/31:01-31:01transcriptListen to \u2018The Daily\u2019: What Hollywood Keeps Getting Wrong About RaceHosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Jessica Cheung, Annie Brown and Theo Balcomb, and edited by Larissa AndersonWesley Morris joins us to talk about \u201cGreen Book,\u201d the latest in a series of Oscar winners that focus on a white character\u2019s moral journey in an interracial friendship.michael barbaroFrom The New York Times, I\u2019m Michael Barbaro.

We are not your hosts, but we\u2019re going to stand here a little too long so that the people who get USA Today tomorrow will think that we hosted.michael barbaroSo last night, I was watching the Academy Awards. I was struck that it was John Lewis, this congressman, but most importantly, this legendary civil rights leader, who introduced \u201cGreen Book\u201d at the awards ceremony.archived recording (john lewis)I can bear witness that the portrait of that time and place in our history is very real.michael barbaroAnd basically endorsed it. And I haven\u2019t seen the movie, but his stamp of approval made me think that I should have.archived recording (john lewis)Our nation bears the scars of that time, as do I. [APPLAUSE]michael barbaroAnd then after \u201cGreen Book\u201d won best picture, later on in the evening, I\u2019d read that Spike Lee, the black director, he walked out of the room in protest.wesley morrisYes.michael barbaroAnd that the award generated a fair amount of controversy. So my question to you is, what exactly happened here?wesley morrisO.K., well, where do you even want to start? How far back in history do you want to go?michael barbaroWherever you think we should in order to really understand this.wesley morrisOh, man. Let\u2019s go back to 1990, which is the Oscar year for the films that came out in 1989. And you have a best-picture slate that is full of movies that we still are with in some ways.archived recordingIf you build it, he will come.wesley morris\u201cField of Dreams\u201d and \u201cDead Poets Society.\u201darchived recordingWe are food for worms, lads.

And \u2014archived recording[CAR ENGINE STARTING]wesley morris\u201cDriving Miss Daisy.\u201darchived recordingMy mother\u2019s a little high-strung. The fact is, you\u2019d be working for me.

So why don\u2019t we just leave it like that?wesley morrisHis name is Hoke. He\u2019s played by Morgan Freeman.

You don\u2019t have to \u2014archived recording (daisy)No, really. You are.wesley morrisIt is a fantasy set during Jim Crow in the South about an impossible friendship that is based in work. And that makes us feel good, because you see this prejudiced woman in a racist climate become friends with this black man who just wants to drive her around. Basically, what happened that year was that Kim Basinger at some point comes out.archived recording (kim basinger)Hello, the world. We\u2019ve got five great films here. And they\u2019re great for one reason, because they tell the truth. But there is one film missing from this list that deserves to be on it, because ironically, it might tell the biggest truth of all.wesley morrisAnd she says, oh, wait a minute, something\u2019s not in this category. And it\u2019s the movie that tells the biggest truth of all.archived recording (kim basinger)And that\u2019s \u201cDo the Right Thing.\u201dmichael barbaroSo Kim Basinger comes in.wesley morrisKim Basinger.michael barbaroFamous white actress, and says, something\u2019s amiss here. \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d should be nominated.wesley morrisNever met Spike Lee. She is dating Prince at this point. Spike Lee \u2014 one of Spike Lee\u2019s favorite people on the whole planet. But I don\u2019t think that really matters. Anyway, she comes out and says this, and it\u2019s a controversial thing. The room is sort of unsure what to do about this.michael barbaroAnd what\u2019s the basic plot?wesley morrisThe basic plot is \u2014archived recordingFight the power! Fight the power!wesley morrisIt is a parable set on the hottest day of the year in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn.archived recording (speaker 1)Who told you to walk on my side of my block?

What do you think won?archived recordingAnd the Oscar goes to \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201c!michael barbaroAnd what does it mean that \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d won best picture in that year?wesley morrisThat it\u2019s the continuation of a long trend of a kind of racial reconciliation fantasy.michael barbaroAnd what does that phrase mean?wesley morrisWell, it\u2019s this idea that you\u2019ve got a white character who typically tends to be racist or bigoted or prejudiced or whatever. And that person is going on this journey, courtesy of this relationship to a black person who has no journey to go on, is just there to morally be a center that this white person can return to, or, like, make his or her way toward.michael barbaroAnd just to be clear, break down this word \u201cfantasy\u201d for me. What is the fantasy?wesley morrisThe fantasy is that prolonged exposure to a black person is going to cure you of your racism. The black person just has to sit there and take your money. And you\u2019re basically buying a friend, who will then absolve you of every horrible thought, every racist deed you\u2019ve ever had or done.michael barbaroAnd what does that look like? How does that fantasy, this dynamic you\u2019re describing \u2014 how does that show up in pop culture over the next few years and maybe even decades?wesley morrisWell, let\u2019s just skip to the \u201880s.archived recording (speaker 1)What do you give the kid who has everything?archived recording (speaker 2)Daddy said anything I wanted. Anything in the store.wesley morrisSo there\u2019s this one movie that I remember very clearly. It\u2019s called \u201cThe Toy.\u201darchived recording (speaker 1)For Eric Bates, it was the only toy in his father\u2019s store \u2014archived recording (speaker 2)I know what I want.archived recording (speaker 1)\u2014 that wasn\u2019t for sale.archived recording (speaker 3)What you\u2019re offering me is not a job, sir. It\u2019s an insult, and I\u2019m insulted.wesley morrisRichard Pryor, who, at this point, if people were taking a poll and saying, name the greatest living comedian, Richard Pryor would probably be at the top of almost everybody\u2019s list. He\u2019s recruited in this movie by Jackie Gleason to be the best friend of his estranged son. Pays him money.archived recording (speaker 1)$2,000?archived recording (speaker 2)With that kind of money, if Eric blows his nose, you wipe it.wesley morrisAnd the idea is that he\u2019s going to befriend this kid.archived recordingIf you want a friend, you don\u2019t buy a friend. You earn a friend.wesley morrisWho is initially pretty obnoxious. Meanwhile, the guy who \u2014 Jackie Gleason\u2019s character is a bigot and a racist, and at some point has to be taught by Richard Pryor\u2019s character that that\u2019s not cool, and being a father is pretty O.K., too.michael barbaroWhy would Richard Pryor take this kind of a role?wesley morrisYour guess is as good as mine. But it\u2019s like, why does anybody take any of these roles? Because there\u2019s nothing else for them to do if they want to be in movies. You don\u2019t have a lot of black people writing and directing movies. Most of the people writing these shows and directing and writing these movies are white people whose ideas about black people come from popular culture that existed before the popular culture they\u2019re making. It\u2019s usually not coming from actual relationships with actual black people. And if it is, it\u2019s compromised by the idea that there\u2019s only so much that they can imagine a black person doing in the first place. So this idea of behind-the-camera representation becomes important during this period, too. But I mean, for our purposes, it\u2019s white people imagining black people, for white people. And then in the 2000s, you have a very easy, classic example of this problem.archived recordingI got a job today writing for the Jackson Journal.wesley morrisIn a movie like \u201cThe Help,\u201d another best picture nominee.archived recording (speaker 1)Aibileen, you spilled something.archived recording (speaker 2)Forgive me, Lord, but I\u2019m going to have to kill that woman, Aibileen.wesley morrisAnd it is essentially the story of some maids in a southern town.archived recordingYou said to write about what disturbs me, particularly if it bothers no one else. I\u2019d like to write something from the point of view of the help. I want to interview you.wesley morrisWho wind up being written about as an expos\u00e9.archived recording (speaker 1)I\u2019m gonna help with your stories.archived recording (speaker 2)We all are.wesley morrisOf the poor treatment they receive at the hands of their white mistresses.archived recordingIt\u2019s quite scandalous. Sounds like Jackson, if you ask me.wesley morrisAnd the book becomes a hit. But it then winds up imperiling the lives and the safety and comfort of the women themselves.archived recordingYou tell Aibileen, do I have plans for her. You\u2019re a godless woman.michael barbaroAnd what is the fantasy in \u201cThe Help\u201c?wesley morrisWell, the fantasy is that you can make the lives better for oppressed women during the Jim Crow era, in which, you know, black people were treated all kinds of horrible \u2014 death, dehumanization, any kind of inequity you can subject a person to black people faced under Jim Crow. And by writing this book, which is what the white main character of this movie does, it\u2019s supposed to make these lives better. And the fantasy is that this woman can come in, interview these black women, they will give their stories to this white woman, who will write a book, sell a bunch of copies. And these black women are going to be left to fend for themselves. But the fantasy that this woman is allowed to have about her do-gooderness is that she actually is making a difference and is going to create a means by which these women can be treated better by the white women they work for.michael barbaroWhen in fact, in some cases, she makes it worse.wesley morrisShe makes it worse. The last shot of that movie is really kind of tragic.archived recordingMae Mobley was my last baby. In just 10 minutes, the only life I knew was done.wesley morrisIt\u2019s just Viola Davis walking down a road \u2014 with no job, by the way.archived recordingGod says we need to love our enemies. It\u2019s hard to do.wesley morrisIt kind of creates this sense that Emma Stone is kind of off the hook, and Viola Davis is on a hook. And the fantasy of the reconciliation is that the conscience-clearing and the act of expressing empathy or sympathy or something is enough.michael barbaroI guess I want to push you on this. Doesn\u2019t inherently spending time with people who are different than we are make us more empathetic? And why would that be anything other than a good thing?wesley morrisThat\u2019s a deep question. The immediate answer, though, is that it\u2019s on the terms of white people. There\u2019s nothing mutual about any of these movies, any of this work. It\u2019s not mutual at all. You aren\u2019t going into the houses and lives of these black characters. And they\u2019re presented as so good as to have no agency. Now \u201cThe Help\u201d sort of pushes back against that a little bit. But to be fair, I mean, if the movie works, and it works as a movie, it\u2019s very easy to overlook a lot of these problems. A well-made movie is effective as a spell-casting mechanism, right? You know, you watch a movie like \u201cThe Help,\u201d and you\u2019re like, but she wrote the book. She got the truth out there about how bad it is for these maids. And what more can she do? What more do you want her to do? She did her job. I just feel like that is a great way to feel, but I\u2019d love to see a black woman\u2019s version of \u201cThe Help.\u201d But I don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever see that, because black people don\u2019t want to tell that story. And the other thing about these movies that\u2019s really worth noting, especially the ones that get near the Oscars, these racial reconciliation fantasies are almost always set in the past. They\u2019re all set during the Jim Crow-era, in the South for the most part, and involve something about the relationship between the white person and the black person being unequal, whether it\u2019s the black person\u2019s I.Q. in \u201cThe Green Mile\u201d or the social standing of the black person in \u201cThe Help.\u201d So these are movies that would say they believe in equality, but there\u2019s nothing equal about the races in them. There\u2019s an inherent imbalance. And the fantasy, of course, is just acknowledging that black people exist and giving them some lines and casting a good actor to play them is a kind of argument for an equality. But it\u2019s not, if you look at the way they function within the system that the movie created for itself.michael barbaroSo lay out for me specifically how you see this racial reconciliation fantasy playing out in \u201cGreen Book.\u201d And I haven\u2019t seen the movie, so keep that in mind.wesley morrisYou\u2019re in for a treat, my friend. So here we are in 2019, and just imagine all this progress in 30 years. So this is the year where the movies have just never been blacker, and the black movies you get have never been this good, right, as a class of movies. You\u2019ve got a movie like \u201cBlindspotting,\u201d \u201cSorry to Bother You,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cBlacKkKlansman.\u201d You\u2019ve got \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk.\u201d You\u2019ve got \u201cWidows.\u201d this is coming a year after \u201cGet Out\u201d was a hit. And that\u2019s coming a year after \u201cMoonlight\u201d won best picture.michael barbaroAll having major black protagonists.wesley morrisMajor black protagonists? They were written and directed by black people. It\u2019s a huge deal. It\u2019s meaningful. So here we are, 2018. This movie called \u201cGreen Book\u201d starts to make its way around the country. And it should be the story of a man named Don Shirley, a black musician who is no longer with us, and the trip he decides to take to the Deep South in 1962. 1962. Like, Jim Crow Deep South, 1962. And he needs somebody to be able to get him from place to place.archived recording (speaker 1)Some guy called over here, a doctor. He\u2019s looking for a driver. You interested?archived recording (speaker 2)I am not a medical doctor. I\u2019m a musician. I\u2019m about to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South. What other experience do you have?archived recording (speaker 3)Public relations.wesley morrisIt\u2019s got to be somebody who\u2019s tough, has a little bit of muscle, isn\u2019t afraid of anything, but is also obviously white.archived recordingDo you foresee any issues in working for a black man? You in the Deep South? There\u2019s going to be problems.wesley morrisSo he decides that the man for the job is a guy named Tony Vallelonga, a kind of bouncer from the Bronx. Now what I just said to you is the opposite of what the movie actually is. The movie is actually the story of Tony Vallelonga, and how he gets a call one day from somebody for a job. And he goes and meets Don Shirley, who he sees and is like, I\u2019m driving for you? No way, I\u2019m not doing that. And Don Shirley, of course, is like, but I need you, you\u2019re my man. You seem to be the most qualified person for the job. Please do it. Drive me. He consents. Thus begins a friendship almost completely from the vantage of Tony Vallelonga.michael barbaroThe white guy.wesley morrisYes. Tony is the protagonist of this movie. We spend the first 25 minutes of it with him. And I saw the poster for this movie, and the poster is Viggo Mortensen in the front seat, Mahershala Ali, who plays Don Shirley, in the back seat. The first thing I thought was, oh my god, you gotta be kidding me.michael barbaroWhy?wesley morrisIt\u2019s \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d all over again! This is 1989 all over again. I can\u2019t believe this.archived recordingKentucky Fried Chicken. In Kentucky. When\u2019s that ever going to happen?wesley morrisI mean, it\u2019s a comedy all in the service of making you feel good about the idea that racist Tony Vallelonga can become increasingly less racist by driving Don around a place that the movie wants you to understand is more racist than Tony.archived recording (speaker 1)I got the bucket so you could have some.archived recording (speaker 2)I\u2019ve never had fried chicken in my life.archived recording (speaker 1)Who are you bullshitting? You people love the fried chicken, the grits and the collard greens. I love it too. Negro cooks used to make it all the time when I was in the army.archived recording (speaker 2)You have a very narrow assessment of me, Tony.archived recording (speaker 1)Yeah, right? I\u2019m good.archived recording (speaker 2)No, no, you\u2019re not good. You\u2019re bad. I\u2019m saying just because other Negroes enjoy certain types of music, it doesn\u2019t mean I have to, nor do we all eat the same kind of food.wesley morrisTony is like a nice, friendly, lovable cartoon racist. But I mean, he\u2019s nothing compared to these Jim Crow people. You know, these Confederate racists who use the N-word every 15 minutes and have Confederate flags everywhere and will beat Don up for coughing. We\u2019ve never seen Tony do that. This entire movie is \u2014 oh my god, it\u2019s a literal vehicle to get Tony from racism to reconciliation in under two hours.archived recording (speaker 1)Eat it. Come on. Take it, take it, take it. I gotta drive. 10 and 2 on the wheel. Come on, take it. Take it. Come on, come on. Here you go. Huh?archived recording (speaker 2)I can\u2019t do this, Tony.archived recording (speaker 1)Eat the [expletive] thing. Jesus.michael barbaroSo this year\u2019s Academy Awards happens on Sunday night, 30 years after \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d wins best picture, and Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d is not even nominated for best picture. What\u2019s going through your head as the evening unfolds? I assume you\u2019re watching it.wesley morrisYeah, I was. I was watching it. I mean, I have to watch it.archived recordingHere are the nominees for best picture.wesley morrisI mean, obviously, there\u2019s a juiciness, right? There\u2019s a kind of moral juiciness. You\u2019ve got \u201cGreen Book\u201d nominated for best picture and four other Oscars. And then you\u2019ve got Spike Lee back at the Oscars in a competitive way for the first time since that Oscar loss in 1990 for \u201cDo the Right Thing.\u201d He was nominated one other time, but this is, like \u2014 this is the big boys\u2019 table if you\u2019re Spike Lee. So here we are. We\u2019re having a little bit of PTSD, because a movie that\u2019s just like \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d is up against a movie in \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d \u2014archived recordingThere\u2019s never been a black cop in this city. We think you might be the man to open things up around here.wesley morrisThat features a black guy in the Colorado Springs Police Department, who basically, via telephone, infiltrates the K.K.K., pretending to be a white guy hoping to join.archived recording (speaker 1)Hello?archived recording (speaker 2)This is Ron Stallworth calling. Who am I speaking with?archived recording (speaker 1)This is David Duke.archived recording (speaker 2)Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, that David Duke?archived recording (speaker 1)Last time I checked. What can I do you for?wesley morrisAnd it obviously is trying to depict a more accurate racial scene than \u201cGreen Book\u201d is trying to depict.archived recording (speaker 1)We must unite and organize to fight racism.archived recording (speaker 2)Are you down for the liberation of black people?archived recording (speaker 3)Power to the people.archived recording (speaker 2)All power to all the people.archived recordingAll power to all the people.archived recording (speaker 3)That\u2019s right, sister.michael barbaroThis is very much, in a sense, a rematch of 1989, 1990.wesley morrisIt is a spiritual rematch involving one of the actual participants, but in different categories, right? And so the stakes are this. If \u201cGreen Book\u201d wins, and you\u2019ve got a movie like \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d nominated for best picture, what on earth is that telling you about where the academy is as a body and what its priorities are in terms of whose point of view matters to the most people?archived recordingAnd the Oscar goes to \u201cGreen Book.\u201dwesley morrisAnd so I feel like I really understand why that movie won. It really does believe that Don Shirley\u2019s insisting that Tony Vallelonga be in his life makes Tony a better person. That feels good, right? It feels good to see a person make a positive change from a bad place to an arguably good one. And I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s very hard to resist that. I mean, for the people who do like it, it is a really good movie. It\u2019s entertaining, and it\u2019s funny. And it\u2019s made by Peter Farrelly of the Farrelly Brothers, the people who brought you \u201cSomething about Mary\u201d and \u201cShallow Hal\u201d and \u201cMe, Myself and Irene.\u201d These guys know how to make a comedy. That\u2019s what they do. And that\u2019s what this movie is, 100 percent \u2014 it\u2019s a comedy. And I don\u2019t think most people watch movies that morally. And there are people who \u2014 you bring this up, and I\u2019m like, but who is Don Shirley to this movie? People get upset. Listen, it\u2019s about interracial friendship. It\u2019s about healing the divide between the races. How dare you? This is a good movie. And it\u2019s saying something positive.michael barbaroRight.wesley morrisWhy do you want negativity in the world? And I never have a good answer for that, because those people \u2014 those people aren\u2019t wrong. But I also feel like this movie is not the solution to anything. It is the perpetuation of the same problems our entertainment\u2019s been giving us since it started.michael barbaroSo Wesley, what is significant about this best picture award? What does it mean that the academy chose a film like this \u2014 one with, to use your words, this racial reconciliation fantasy as so central to its plot \u2014 as the best film of the year?wesley morrisIt\u2019s a fantasy. And it does nothing to address or acknowledge the infrastructural problems that keep the races divided. If anything, the enthusiasm for a movie like \u201cGreen Book\u201d only makes \u2014 it kind of makes the problem worse, in some ways. Because it makes it seem like the movies don\u2019t care about the way racism actually works. They just want to make racism go away. I mean, let me just put it this way. I\u2019ll put it in the most human terms I possibly can \u2014 personal terms. I have white friends. I see very little art about the kind of friendships I have with white people. I have friendships with white people that don\u2019t involve making them feel better about their racism, to the extent that they have it. We talk about that stuff. Like, why did you say that? Why did you do that? These are not cataclysmic conversations. These relationships are about a mutual curiosity. These people want to know what my life is like as a black person. They want to know what my family is like, what my family history is like. There is a give and take. There is a real questioning of the larger systemic problems in this country that affect the relationship that I\u2019m even able to have with these white people. And that is not the thing that you see discussed in these movies. I think that the movies have an obligation to entertain us, but I think they also have an obligation to be fair to certain aspects of social reality. Because people take lessons from this stuff. All I\u2019m saying is, \u201cGreen Book\u201d is another version of a movie we\u2019ve been watching for 100 years.michael barbaroWesley, I\u2019m really struck that I think it was about a month ago, you wrote an essay for The Times in which you kind of laid out everything we\u2019re talking about now. You reminded us that 30 years ago, \u201cDriving Miss Daisy\u201d won, and that this idea of the racial reconciliation fantasy remains prominent in Hollywood and was at the center of \u201cGreen Book.\u201d And you seemed to kind of presciently suggest that that movie might win and that it might carry the day because of the power of this concept you were describing. And that is exactly what happened.wesley morrisI mean, listen, there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s like, I never am right about the Oscar winners. But I just felt this one. I felt this one. I felt like there was a way in which the thing that happened on Sunday does mirror whatever is happening in this country right now, where a segment of the population is feeling really paranoid and a little bit endangered and is worried about feeling displaced or unseated by change. And to the extent that the people who make our movies are a microcosm of the nation writ large, the academy is undergoing some changes, and it is becoming less white and less male. And I think they\u2019re going to, like, cling even more tightly to things that feel safe and familiar. And this is a movie that feels safe, and it feels comforting in some way. Because it lets them believe that on the one hand, they can say they\u2019re giving their top honor to a movie about an interracial friendship and about racial reconciliation.michael barbaroRight.wesley morrisBut to me, what that says about them is also a fantasy, right? It\u2019s also a fantasy that says, this symbol of excellence, and this symbol of our tastes and our belief as a body, or at least the people who voted for it, really does sort of reflect what we should be as a nation. And that\u2019s not what we are. So the aspiration that we can just make this racism go away by running out and finding the nearest black person to pay us to be better people is absurd. And I think that\u2019s what happened on Sunday.michael barbaroWesley, thank you very much.wesley morrisOh, my pleasure.michael barbaroWesley talked about \u201cGreen Book,\u201d race and the Academy Awards with his co-host, Jenna Wortham, in the latest episode of their podcast, \u201cStill Processing.\u201dCries of foul, however, were plentiful.Dr. Boyd, the U.S.C. professor, said that, in part, he saw the selection of \u201cGreen Book\u201d as pushback by older, more conservative voters.\u201cThere are inherently people in the academy who think the organization\u2019s diversity efforts are going too far,\u201d he said by phone on Monday.Justin Chang, a film critic for The Los Angeles Times, blasted \u201cGreen Book\u201d in an article that was posted online minutes after the film won.\u201c\u2018Green Book\u2019 is an embarrassment; the film industry\u2019s unquestioning embrace of it is another,\u201d Mr. Chang wrote. He said the film \u201creduces the long, barbaric and ongoing history of American racism to a problem, a formula, a dramatic equation that can be balanced and solved.\u201dThere were also comparisons to \u201cCrash,\u201d which won best picture in 2006, beating \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d and drew similar outrage for its depiction of race relations. \u201cGreen Book,\u201d for instance, has the lowest score on Metacritic, the review-aggregation site, of any best-picture winner since \u201cCrash.\u201dThe contrasting emotions during Sunday\u2019s ceremony could be seen in Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s presentation of the two awards for screenwriting.Standing onstage with Brie Larson, Mr. Jackson opened the red envelope containing the winning names for original screenplay and made a slight grimace, initially seeming reluctant to even announce that Mr. Farrelly, Nick Vallelonga and Brian Curie had won for \u201cGreen Book.\u201d (Mr. Vallelonga, whose father was the model for the character portrayed by Mr. Mortensen, came under attack in January for making an anti-Muslim comment on Twitter in 2015. He apologized.)ImageFrom left, David Rabinowitz, Kevin Willmott and Charlie Wachtel also won best adapted screenplay awards for \u201cBlacKkKlansman.\u201dCreditMonica Almeida for The New York TimesAfter the three men accepted the prize, Mr. Jackson and Ms. Larson stepped back to the microphone to open the adapted screenplay envelope. A euphoric Mr. Jackson shouted Mr. Lee\u2019s name for \u201cBlacKkKlansman,\u201d and the director jumped into his buddy\u2019s arms when he got to the stage.It was Mr. Lee\u2019s first Oscar win. He shared the prize with his fellow writers Kevin Willmott, who is black, and Charlie Wachtel and David Rabinowitz, who are both white.Speaking to reporters backstage after the ceremony, Mr. Lee at first declined to comment on his film\u2019s losing best picture to \u201cGreen Book.\u201d Then he compared \u201cGreen Book\u201d to \u201cDriving Miss Daisy,\u201d the racial reconciliation fantasy that won for best picture in 1990, when Mr. Lee\u2019s groundbreaking \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d was not even nominated.\u201cI\u2019m snakebit,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, every time somebody is driving somebody, I lose.\u201dMr. Lee also compared the best-picture win by \u201cGreen Book\u201d to his beloved New York Knicks\u2019 losing a close game.\u201cI thought I was courtside at the Garden, and the ref made a bad call,\u201d he said.Mr. Lee added, however, that the academy was changing, noting the organization\u2019s aggressive efforts to diversify its membership after the #OscarsSoWhite outcries of 2015 and 2016. At least \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d was nominated this time, he said, so it wasn\u2019t a complete example of history\u2019s repeating itself.\u201cThey opened up the academy to make the academy look more like America,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why three black women, if I\u2019m counting correctly, won Oscars.\u201d He was correct: Regina King won the supporting-actress award for \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk,\u201d while two \u201cBlack Panther\u201d department heads, Hannah Beachler (production design) and Ruth E. Carter (costumes), became the first African-Americans to receive Oscars in their categories.Mr. Willmott, who got his start in Hollywood two decades ago, summed up both the euphoria and disappointment.\u201cTonight is a huge step forward, I think, in many different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still frustrating at times.\u201d"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: How to Really Tax the Rich", "category": "Business", "id": "672caeda-2811-4938-84f4-da171f5437cb", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/dealbook/tax-the-rich.html", "publishdate": 20190225, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/26/business/26db-newsletter-sanders/merlin_150887157_fb2001f9-8ccf-41aa-9777-aa00a12f088b-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Monday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)There are other ways to tax the wealthyA majority of Americans are increasingly open to raising taxes on the wealthy. Lawmakers like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders have proposed revolutionary ways of reducing wealth inequality. But Andrew writes that there are other ways of bridging the gap \u2014 ways that stand a chance of becoming law.Start with the estate tax. Gary Cohn, the former White House economic adviser, once said, \u201cOnly morons pay the estate tax.\u201d Andrew recommends starting there, writing that no fix could work without this. One solution: taxing inherited property at its current worth to capture gains in value made over decades. According to the Congressional Budget Office, closing this loophole could raise more than $650 billion over a decade.Raise capital gains rates for the wealthy. Andrew suggests introducing two new tax brackets \u2014 say, a marginal 30 percent bracket for those earning over $5 million and a 35 percent bracket for over $15 million \u2014 so the U.S. could raise money without discouraging investment.Close the carried-interest loophole. Current tax law allows executives at investment firms to have bonuses taxed as capital gains, not ordinary income. Scrapping that \u2014 an idea that President Trump has supported \u2014 has clear appeal to Americans\u2019 basic sense of fairness.Reconsider breaks for charitable giving. At a minimum, Andrew writes, \u201cwe ought to consider whether the wealthy should be allowed to take deductions when they move money to their own foundations, or whether they should only take a deduction when the money is spent.\u201d Support the I.R.S. \u201cThe agency is so underfunded that the chance an individual gets audited is minuscule,\u201d Andrew writes.Deadline extension doesn\u2019t end the trade warPresident Trump has delayed his own March 1 deadline to raise tariffs on Chinese goods, Ana Swanson and Alan Rappeport of the NYT report:\u2022 Mr. Trump cited \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in trade talks between American and Chinese officials.\u2022 He said that negotiators had forged a compromise on key issues, including intellectual property and the trade of agriculture and energy products.\u2022 The president also expects to meet with President Xi Jinping of China to finalize a deal.\u201cThe extension will prevent the United States from increasing tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese exports to 25 percent from 10 percent on March 2,\u201d Ms. Swanson and Mr. Rappeport write. \u201cThe delay, which Mr. Trump had dangled as a possibility in recent weeks, is likely to calm volatile financial markets and reassure business owners who depend on China.\u201dBut there is still uncertainty. \u201cIn a hint of how fluid the talks remain, the two sides did not sign an official agreement and the White House did not release details on any agreements,\u201d Ms. Swanson and Mr. Rappeport write. The Chinese state news agency Xinhua says that \u201cnew uncertainties\u201d could emerge, and analysts think trade tensions won\u2019t go away.Tensions are reportedly high inside the White House.  Mr. Trump and his top trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, \u201chave grown increasingly frustrated with each other,\u201d Bloomberg reports, citing unidentified sources. Mr. Trump was apparently embarrassed when Mr. Lightizer corrected him in front of the Chinese delegation, while Mr. Lightizer \u201chas been growing irritated with Mr. Trump\u2019s interventions.\u201dTheresa May delayed a crucial Brexit voteThe British prime minister announced yesterday that a final vote on her Brexit deal that had been scheduled for this week will now take place by March 12 \u2014 just 17 days before Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U.She is trying to buy time, so that she can secure tweaks to the agreement that will make it palatable to British lawmakers. \u201cWe still have it within our grasp to leave the European Union with a deal on the 29th of March,\u201d she told reporters. The Confederation of British Industry accused her of \u201crunning down the clock.\u201dParliament could undermine her game plan. Mrs. May is trying to keep the prospect of a no-deal Brexit on the table, hoping that will convince lawmakers to support her deal.

But as Peter Goodman of the NYT points out, the dollar remains the world\u2019s haven, at least when it comes to currencies.\u2022 \u201cBecause banks cannot risk jeopardizing their access to the plumbing of the dollar-based global financial network, they have taken pains to steer clear of nations and companies deemed pariahs in Washington.\u201d\u2022 \u201cIn a clear indication that the American currency has been gaining power, dollar-denominated lending to borrowers outside the United States, excluding banks, soared between late 2007 and early 2018, according to the Bank for International Settlements.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s restrictions on taking money out of the country and its alarming detentions of foreigners \u2014 often in parallel with geopolitical scrapes \u2014 have tested the appeal of holding money embossed with the image of Chairman Mao.\u201d\u2022 \u201cA series of crises within the 19 countries that share the euro has provoked more animosity than unity, revealing a foundational defect: The euro is a common currency lacking a common political structure that can guarantee a robust response when trouble arises.\u201d\u2022 \u201c\u2018There is no alternative to the dollar,\u2019 said Mark Blyth, an international political economist at Brown University.\u201dImageRichard Yu, the C.E.O. of Huawei\u2019s consumer unit, showing off the Mate X folding phone.CreditAndreu Dalmau/EPA, via ShutterstockWhat to expect from the world\u2019s biggest mobile showMobile World Congress, the world\u2019s largest mobile technology event, takes place in Barcelona this week.

That means figuring out what makes either of them a crime can be difficult.Mr. Bezos claimed in a blog post that American Media threatened to publish photographs, including a \u201cbelow the belt selfie,\u201d unless he publicly stated that The Enquirer\u2019s reporting on his affair with Lauren Sanchez was not \u201cpolitically motivated or influenced by political forces.\u201d American Media has asserted that it \u201cacted lawfully\u201d in its reporting on Mr. Bezos\u2019 affair, although it also said it would investigate his claims.Was the threat to publish the photos extortion or blackmail? Establishing that requires working out if hardball tactics crossed the line into crime.Two rights can make a wrongBlackmail is a strange offense because it involves two acts which, if undertaken separately, are legal. If The National Enquirer simply published the photos, it would not be blackmail. Nor would asking Mr. Bezos to make the statement about its motivations for investigating him be considered wrongful, even if it were untruthful.But the combination of a threat to publish with the demand for action could turn two legal acts into a crime.The federal blackmail statute might not classify Mr. Bezos\u2019 case as blackmail. Proving a violation requires that the threat involve disclosure of a legal violation by the victim, and it does not appear that publishing intimate photos and communications involves any potential legal violation. Nor was there a demand for money from Mr. Bezos. Whether the statement requested from him constitutes a \u201cvaluable thing\u201d may also be open to question.That may not absolve American Media if state prosecutors pursue a criminal case. Some state laws are much broader than the federal statute. Under the blackmail statute in the District of Columbia, where The Washington Post, which is owned by Mr. Bezos, was investigating the motivations of The National Enquirer, it is a crime \u201cto expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact, whether true or false, tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt, or ridicule\u201d and \u201cto impair the reputation of any person.\u201dReporting or extorting?The other crime Mr. Bezos accused The National Enquirer of committing is extortion. According to one part of the federal statute, to prove this crime, the government must establish that a threat was wrongful, not just harmful to the victim\u2019s reputation.In United States v. Jackson, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan overturned in 1999 the convictions of defendants who tried to make Bill Cosby pay them $40 million to keep quiet about the fact that he had an out-of-wedlock child. The court stated that a threat was \u201cinherently wrongful\u201d if the party delivering it sought something via extortion that it would not receive otherwise.The question is whether a publication like The National Enquirer, which is protected by the First Amendment, engages in extortion if it tells subjects that it plans to expose embarrassing information about them unless they make a public statement. Most extortion prosecutions involve a demand for money, not an announcement about the purity of one\u2019s motives, so whether that is enough to show a violation is an open question.What awaits American MediaA provision of the deferred prosecution agreement that American Media reached with federal prosecutors in Manhattan for campaign finance violations during the 2016 presidential election states that the company \u201cshall commit no crimes whatsoever\u201d during its term. Typically, such provisions cover only federal crimes, but the breadth of this one means that state offenses could result in the agreement being pulled and charges reinstated, along with new charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.The New York Times reported that federal prosecutors were investigating Mr. Bezos\u2019 claim that The National Enquirer sought to extort or blackmail him. The challenge for American Media will be to show that its conduct was simply the kind of aggressive reporting that media outlets pursue, especially when it involves a person of public interest like Mr. Bezos, and did not cross over into a criminal violation.Ultimately, the Justice Department may be reluctant to reinstate charges against the company. It could avoid that by extending the deferred prosecution agreement and instituting closer oversight of how The National Enquirer deals with the subjects of its reporting. That may be enough for American Media to avoid facing new federal criminal charges.Whether that would stop a state prosecutor from pursuing a case against The National Enquirer is an open question."}, {"title": "Lured by Pre-Brexit Bargain, German Buyer Goes on London Real Estate Spree", "category": "Business", "id": "50ce2281-dc9f-4f24-bea6-e7f0d70420aa", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/brexit-real-estate-london.html", "publishdate": 20190225, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/25/business/25jpsubrealbrexit2-print/25jpsubrealbrexit2-print-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The view south from Hill House, a 14-story apartment block perched on a hill in North London, is about as spectacular as it gets in the sprawling British capital.Floor-to-ceiling windows on every floor give a clear vista of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, the glass-coated Shard and the rest of London\u2019s constantly changing jumble of office towers, with the distant fields of Surrey fading away to the horizon.The German real estate company Grand City Properties S.A. saw something else in that London panorama: an investment lucrative enough, and priced well enough, to defy the more pessimistic forecasts about the looming impact of Brexit.Grand City, the fourth-largest residential company in Germany, had never bought London property before. But in recent months, it has quietly picked up the 117 apartments that remained unsold in the 159-unit Hill House, part of a little-noticed buying spree that has so far netted more than 800 apartments and could reach twice that number.A property market that is waiting nervously for some clarity about how it will be affected by Britain\u2019s scheduled departure from the European Union in March would normally be relieved, or even delighted, by this seeming vote of confidence from such a powerful buyer, a company that owns and rents 86,000 homes in Germany.But the most intriguing aspect of this first big London shopping spree by any major German residential property company, and one that will worry current homeowners, is the heavy discounts that Grand City says it was able to secure while other units in the same projects remained for sale at higher prices.The discounts achieved by the Germans indicate that true London prices may be much softer than those publicly advertised, suggesting that even a smooth Brexit transition will do little to lift London real estate prices anytime soon. On the other hand, if you are looking to buy, the next few years may be the right time to take the plunge.Despite the uncertainties of Brexit, Central London\u2019s famously high-priced real estate appears on the surface to have kept much of its value, even if it has not matched the rising value of real estate elsewhere in Britain. Sale prices have dipped less than 1 percent in the last year, experts say. But some say that figure masks the real story.They say most potential London sellers have delayed their sales, rather than offer them at deep price cuts. The number of high-end transactions is down 25 percent compared with last year, a statistic that points to a heavy pent-up supply, according to Adam Challis, the head of residential research for the JLL real estate agency.Grand City\u2019s quickly assembled portfolio includes apartments in 11 new or recently built buildings at an average price of about \u00a3620 a square foot and ranging from 20 percent to 40 percent below market prices, its executives said.Christian Windfuhr, the chief executive of Frankfurt-listed Grand City, said the purchases were \u201cpurely opportunistic,\u201d based on offering fast cash. While he said he did not believe any of the developers had been in danger of collapse, he was sure that those companies, which include some of Britain\u2019s largest developers, had \u201cneeded to sell quickly.\u201d\u201cThe key is, we were able to get very good discounts because some of the developers were under pressure to sell,\u201d Mr. Windfuhr said.ImageThe German company Grand City ventured to London to purchase 117 apartments in Hill House, a 14-story, 159-unit apartment building that offers sprawling views of the city.CreditAndrew Testa for The New York TimesThe developers were not selling solely for fear of an unruly or \u201chard\u201d Brexit, but also because of a combination of factors that have already damaged the market, he said.Brexit is only one of several problems dragging down prices, including a glut of nearly completed new developments and the effects of a series of tax increases imposed in recent years. In addition, some rich buyers from Russia and China, who have seen London property as a good place to safeguard their money, are finding it harder to move money overseas.\u201cA lot of those new apartments are too expensive for the owner-occupier market, and I had assumed that would mean prices would fall,\u201d said Marcus Dixon, the head of data analysis at LonRes, which collects information on property transactions. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen on any price lists or public marketing. Instead they seem to be being sold like this \u2014 in bulk and with no marketing costs, so the developer can just move on to their next project.\u201d\u201cThe developers,\u201d he added, \u201care more like forced sellers in that way. Some of these discounts will make them wince, but they will welcome it as a relatively easy way to get out of a project without publicly shocking the market.\u201dGrand City declined to provide figures on any individual transaction but said it had paid 20 percent below recent market prices for apartments in Hill House, a 1960s office block that was recently converted to apartments.The developer of Hill House disputed that claim, saying that studios and one-bedroom apartments on the market for \u00a3315,000 to \u00a3600,000 had been sold at a discount of only 10 percent.\u201cThe dip in the market means we have not made quite as much as we thought we would, but it certainly wasn\u2019t a forced sale,\u201d said Adam Brockley, the chief executive of Bode, which renovated Hill House.\u201cThe market was starting to cool, and we did not know whether the velocity of sales would continue.\u201dOthers that sold property to Grand City did not respond when reached, though they were given several opportunities to dispute the discounts that the German company said it had negotiated.Such discounts, experts say, hide the true weakness of the market.Mr. Dixon, of LonRes, said that sales volumes in the capital were about half what they were five years ago and that about 60 percent of properties listed for sale in Central London were eventually being withdrawn, often after sitting unsold for five or six months.At the same time, about 30,000 unsold apartments are nearing completion after a boom in massive tower-based projects at sites like Canary Wharf, Nine Elms and Greenwich Peninsula, which are scattered along the Thames River.Yakir Gabay, a 52-year-old Israeli billionaire who is Grand City\u2019s founder and chairman and lives in London, played a role in alerting the company to the fact that \u201cthere are developers in London who need to get out and find a buyer interested in going into the rental game,\u201d Mr. Windfuhr said.\u201cPrices have been falling ever since Brexit discussions began, and when nobody knows which way the cookie is going to crumble on Brexit, a lot of people would rather rent than buy,\u201d Mr. Windfuhr said. \u201cDevelopers are sitting on a lot of stock and need to sell to get onto their next development, and this is typically how opportunities arise for us, when owners are too highly leveraged.ImageGrand City\u2019s sister company bought two Hilton hotels, including at Hyde Park.CreditAndrew Testa for The New York Times\u201cWe believe that the discounts we have got mean that we have already priced in the small dip that might come from a hard Brexit, on top of the dip there has already been because of Brexit.\u201dAnother Grand City purchase was 19 of the 98 units in a gleaming metallic-finished 14-story project called 57 East on Kingsland High Street in Dalston, where the company paid \u00a3600 to \u00a3660 a square foot, compared with a market rate of \u00a3800 to \u00a3850, according to research by Sam Bealing, an analyst at UBS.A further deal, Grand City officials said, was for all 50 studios and three one-bedroom apartments in a less imposing converted local authority office building at 68 Halliford Street, Islington, where a spokesman for the developer, EEH Ventures, declined to comment. Other London-area purchases were in Highbury, Catford, Fulham, Greenwich, Harringay and Brentford.Grand City\u2019s sister company Aroundtown, which focuses on German commercial property, has joined the foray into London by buying two Hilton hotels, at Hyde Park and near King\u2019s Cross, which it sees as Brexit-proof because of the long-term strength of tourism, plus offices at  15 Berkeley Street and 35 Dover Street in Central London.Some researchers remain optimistic about the London market. Lucian Cook, the director of residential research at the Savills real estate agency, said that he, too, believed that the tendency to hold back listings was the only reason there had not been more drastic price drops in prime London real estate.He also sees problems in the coming years over Brexit and the scheduled 2022 elections, but he said he expected a rebound the following year, adding up to a 12.4 percent gain over the five years spanning 2019-23.Rogier Quirijns, the head of European research at Cohen & Steers, the world\u2019s largest investor in real estate investment trusts, is less optimistic.While prices in other British cities have held up reasonably well, prices in London \u201chave come off even without Brexit, in the same way that New York and Sydney have come off levels that were not affordable,\u201d he said.\u201cThere had been a price bubble since the financial crisis, largely because of London\u2019s special role as a destination for capital from around the world looking for a safe haven.\u201dThose days appear to be over. \u201cChina and some other countries are making it harder to move money overseas,\u201d Mr. Quirijns said. \u201cAt the same time we have had all these new apartments coming onto the market in Central London that are too small and expensive for what people actually want to live in.\u201cTime is on your side if you are a buyer but not if you are a seller, because even without a hard Brexit, if interest rates go up, this country will have some huge issues. The British people are obsessed with the property ladder, but I think they are about to realize that there is also a property slide.\u201dMr. Quirijns sees Grand City\u2019s discount buying spree as a powerful indicator of the true state of the market.\u201cThat\u2019s more than a straw in the wind. I think London housing prices need to fall another 20 percent before it looks like a \u2018buy\u2019 to me.\u201d"}, {"title": "Seamless Ratings for Hostless Oscars", "category": "Business", "id": "443cc934-690e-431c-9e62-7e4133469cff", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/media/oscars-tv-ratings-abc.html", "publishdate": 20190225, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/26/business/26ABCOSCARS/merlin_151198590_412e24df-6c43-4b0d-91cc-fea8e8c9366b-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Who needs a host?For the first time in five years, the Oscars broadcast had growth in viewership.Now for the not-so-great news: While the Academy Awards show on Sunday, which honored \u201cGreen Book\u201d for best picture, had 29.6 million viewers, a 12 percent increase from last year, it still attracted the second-lowest viewership since Nielsen started keeping track of the ratings in 1974.At least for now, the Oscars has managed to snap its losing streak.Before the broadcast, there was plenty of concern within ABC and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that the Oscars had not yet hit rock bottom. Last year\u2019s ceremony, hosted by ABC\u2019s own Jimmy Kimmel, had 26.5 million viewers, a 19 percent drop from 2017 and well below the 43.7 million viewers who had tuned in as recently as 2014.The 2018 number was a record low, beating out the previous least-watched Oscars, the 2008 broadcast. A total of 32 million watched that hastily organized ceremony, which came together days after the conclusion of the Writers Guild of America\u2019s strike.The ceremony on Sunday, which went without a host for the first time in 30 years, was warmly received by critics. ABC had promised a brisk ceremony, and for the most part, that\u2019s what it delivered.A brief, energetic performance by the surviving members of Queen, with Adam Lambert fronting the band, took the place of the usual lengthy monologue. Awards were handed out at a quick pace, with the best supporting actress winner, Regina King, offering her thanks in the opening minutes.As they presented that award, Tina Fey, Maya Rudolph and Amy Poehler delivered a quick satire of the usual opening remarks. Other entertainers, from Keegan-Michael Key floating down from the rafters with an umbrella, \u00e0 la Mary Poppins, to Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper sitting side by side on a piano bench for \u201cShallow,\u201d kept things moving. Several high-grossing movies \u2014 \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d and \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d \u2014 remained in contention for major awards to the end, which also may have helped maintain viewer interest.The broadcast was considerably shorter than recent ceremonies and the second straight to begin at 8 p.m. Eastern time, rather than the old start time of 8:30. That meant that the final presenter, Julia Roberts, was able to say good night at 11:17. Several recent ceremonies had dragged on past midnight.ABC and the academy had been dedicated to finding ways to make the Oscars more ratings-friendly. Last year, network executives encouraged winners to keep speeches fun and frothy and to avoid third-rail material, like invoking President Trump.Before this year\u2019s ceremony, the academy announced it would move four categories off the live telecast altogether and introduce a new best popular movie Oscar. A Hollywood backlash forced the academy to walk back both decisions.In December, the comedian Kevin Hart was set to host the 91st Oscars, only to bow out days later, after several of his old tweets and comments were deemed homophobic. ABC had hoped the drama surrounding the host issue would lift the viewership.\u201cIronically, I have found that the lack of clarity around the Oscars has kept the Oscars really in the conversation, and that the mystery has been really compelling,\u201d Karey Burke, ABC\u2019s president for entertainment, said this month. \u201cPeople really care.\u201dThe viewership boost kept the Oscars as the dominant awards show program. In recent years, the Grammys and Golden Globes were becoming a threat, but that has abated. This year\u2019s Grammys had 19.9 million viewers, a slight uptick over last year, and the Globes drew 18.6 million."}, {"title": "This Stock Market Rally Has Everything, Except Investors", "category": "Business", "id": "e1736222-6c13-48a2-be66-c28ee9b96652", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/stock-market-buybacks.html", "publishdate": 20190225, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/26/business/26markets/merlin_151107114_141d4b81-cdaf-41c7-9c39-2b4a5beb4358-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Armchair investors have been selling stock. So have pension funds and mutual funds, as well as a whole other category of investors \u2014 nonprofit groups, endowments, private equity firms and personal trusts. The stock market is off to its best start since 1987, but these investors are expected to dump hundreds of billions of dollars of shares this year.So who is pushing prices higher? In part, the companies themselves. American corporations flush with cash from last year\u2019s tax cuts and a growing economy are buying back their own shares at an extraordinary clip. They have good reason: Buybacks allow them to return cash to shareholders, burnish key measures of financial performance and goose their share prices.The surge in buybacks reflects a fundamental shift in how the market is operating, cementing the position of corporations as the single largest source of demand for American stocks. The binge has helped sustain a bull market approaching its 10th birthday, even in the face of political, international and economic uncertainty. Since the market rally began in March 2009, the S&P 500 has risen more than 300 percent as the United States recovered from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But few expect those kinds of gains over the next decade. Facing the prospect of a period of relatively low returns \u2014 or even a bear market for stocks \u2014 many investors are eager to protect their gains or to find more appealing investments, like emerging markets and corporate bonds, outside the American stock market. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be a hog,\u201d said Rich Robben, interim chief investment officer of the Kentucky Retirement Systems, which manages more than $17 billion in the state\u2019s retirement and insurance funds. \u201cWe\u2019ve all eaten at the public equity trough very well for 10 years now. And we felt it was just time to reduce that exposure a bit.\u201dMr. Robben said his pension fund, which pays benefits to more than 100,000 retired state and county workers, has been cutting its stake in the domestic stock market for 18 months. Such prudence paid off late last year, when concerns about a sluggish global economy, rising interest rates and slowing corporate profits hit the market. The S&P 500 fell 14 percent in the fourth quarter, and 9 percent in December alone. That was the worst monthly performance since February 2009, and badly shook investor confidence. Since the worst of the sell-off, on Dec. 24, the S&P 500 is up roughly 19 percent. But data show that many investors remain nervous: In every week this year, money has flowed out of domestic stock market mutual funds and exchange-traded funds \u2014 as much as $15 billion in the last week of January, according to EPFR Global, which tracks flows into and out of funds. These investors, overwhelmingly individuals, have moved money into bonds and cash. Henry Crutcher has missed a bit of the rebound. Mr. Crutcher, a 44-year-old software company owner in Atlanta, saw December\u2019s crack in the stock market as a buying opportunity and moved roughly 10 percent of his portfolio from cash into a Russell 2000 exchange-traded fund. After enjoying a couple weeks of rising stock prices, he sold it, missing much of the roughly 10 percent of additional gains that have come since mid-January.\u201cRight now I\u2019m partially invested,\u201d Mr. Crutcher said. \u201cI\u2019m not totally sitting on the sidelines. But I\u2019m more on the sidelines than I think I should be.\u201dSurvey data suggests portfolio managers at many mutual funds and hedge funds have also been skittish about chasing the market higher. A survey of global fund managers by Bank of America Merrill Lynch this month reported that those holding more money in cash than usual outnumbered their stock-friendly counterparts by 44 percentage points \u2014 the biggest margin since January 2009. Such statistics suggest that many investors failed to capitalize on the sharp snapback in stocks early this year. \u201cThe speed of the rally is uncomfortable,\u201d said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cTo turn from a seller to a buyer in a week is, again, psychologically very tough for people.\u201dCorporations, however, don\u2019t seem to be experiencing such angst. In the fourth quarter last year, American companies bought an estimated $240 billion of their own shares, according to an analysis by the Goldman Sachs team that handles stock buybacks for major companies. That\u2019s nearly 60 percent higher than during the same period in 2017. More buybacks are coming. The Union Pacific railroad has bought nearly $32 billion in its own shares since 2007, and this month authorized buying over $20 billion more. The tech equipment giant Cisco has spent roughly $20 billion on buybacks in the past year, and has authorizations to spend another $24 billion. And Bank of America, which planned to buy $20 billion of its own shares by the end of June, just added $2.5 billion on top of that, the bank said this month.Besides returning cash to shareholders, buybacks offer companies two crucial benefits. They increase demand for a stock, helping to prop up share prices. Buybacks also improve a key gauge of profitability closely tracked by investors and analysts: When a company buys back shares, the same profits are spread over the smaller number of shares still outstanding, improving their earnings-per-share number. So far this year, companies have announced plans to repurchase a total of more than $190 billion of their own shares. That is only slightly behind last year\u2019s pace of buyback announcements. And last year was a record for buybacks, as companies, in part thanks to the Trump administration\u2019s tax cut, gobbled $910 billion of their shares, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs. Before the early 1980s, buying shares with corporate money was considered a legal gray area because it might open a company up to charges of manipulating its share price. In 1982, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that allowed share repurchases, provided they followed certain rules.Since then, stock buybacks have largely replaced dividends as companies\u2019 preferred way to return to shareholders the cash they can\u2019t spend productively. Shareholders like buybacks because they reduce the numbers of shares outstanding, which results in each remaining share being worth a bigger slice of the company. Taxes on buybacks can also be deferred until investors sell the shares, which are then taxed as capital gains. While share buybacks tend to increase companies\u2019 share prices, critics blame them for stymieing corporate investment, hiring and wages. They argue that when a company spends its cash on buybacks, it leaves less money available for long-term capital spending and wages. Supporters of buybacks argue, however, that companies won\u2019t make new investments or increase hiring if they don\u2019t see a profitable reason to do so. They contend that banning buybacks would simply result in higher dividend payments and corporate cash holdings or a surge in mergers and acquisitions. Senators Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, and Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, said this month that they planned to introduce legislation that would limit buybacks for companies that did not pay their workers at least a $15 an hour, among other criteria. Also this month, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said he planned to introduce a bill that would change the preferential tax treatment of buybacks, though the details of such an approach remain unclear. But even if such proposals were enacted \u2014 and few Republicans have voiced support for Mr. Rubio\u2019s idea \u2014 it\u2019s not clear that they would derail the stock market\u2019s ever-higher march. A number of other factors \u2014 most notably the Federal Reserve\u2019s abrupt turn away from its clockwork pattern of interest-rate increases \u2014 have combined to restore confidence since the brutal sell-off that left the S&P 500 down nearly 20 percent for the year on Christmas Eve.The arrival of a solid, if unspectacular, batch of fourth-quarter earnings reports also quelled some investors\u2019 fears about the outlook for the global economy and corporate profits.But the persistent flow of corporate money into the stock market has been a pivotal element in its recent rise. \u201cBuybacks are likely the No. 1 cause,\u201d said Brian Reynolds, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, a Canadian asset management and brokerage firm. Buybacks\u2019 importance to the rally means any legislative push that results in less activity could act as a headwind to stocks, said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company. But if such changes don\u2019t gain a foothold, corporate buying will most likely remain a cornerstone of the stock market in the coming years. This year alone, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated, corporations will be by far the largest buyer of shares, with net purchases of $700 billion. Traditional investors like mutual funds, pensions, endowments and individuals are expected to be net sellers, parting with roughly $400 billion in shares.

It would light up with an orange dot every time someone gave with the location of each donation.Within minutes of the 7 a.m. announcement, the whole screen was glowing orange, according to people in the room.By Monday, after less than a week as a presidential candidate, Mr. Sanders has collected $10 million from 359,914 donors, campaign officials said. But perhaps just as daunting a figure for his rivals is this: Nearly 39 percent of those donors used an email address that had never before been used to give to Mr. Sanders.For Mr. Sanders, the flood of money from fresh email addresses suggested to his team that he was dramatically expanding a donor network that had already dwarfed his 2020 competition.\u201cOur second day,\u201d said Ari Rabin-Havt, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, \u201cwas bigger than anybody else\u2019s first day.\u201d[Keep up with the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]There is little surprise that Mr. Sanders, whose 2016 Democratic primary run was powered by $230 million in grass-roots giving, would post big fund-raising numbers if he ran again. But the size of his advantage \u2014 he raised $5.9 million in his first day as a candidate, nearly 20 times what Senator Elizabeth Warren did in her first day and nearly four times more than Senator Kamala Harris\u2019s $1.5 million \u2014 has established him as a financial front-runner in a crowded Democratic field.\u201cI think the fact that he has raised so much, so fast, so early should be concerning for anyone else who wants to pick up the liberal flag in this nominating contest,\u201d said Craig Varoga, a Democratic strategist who is unaligned in the race.Of Mr. Sanders\u2019s wave of day one donations, only 17 people gave him the maximum allowable amount of $2,800, meaning he can ask more than 99.99 percent of his donors to give again. As of late Monday, only 20 donors have given Mr. Sanders the legal maximum; another 46 gave $2,700, the limit in the last campaign.More than 48,000 donors have already agreed to give to Mr. Sanders over and over, signing up for recurring donations to be drawn from their credit cards worth a combined more than $1 million each month, according to statistics provided to The New York Times by the campaign. The average overall contribution was just under $26.But the fact that such a large share of donations came from new email addresses is perhaps the most significant figure beyond the overall totals. While some fraction of those new email addresses are surely old donors with updated contact information \u2014 college students who graduated, for instance, or people who changed jobs \u2014 the idea that a sizable share of Mr. Sanders\u2019s donors could be new undercuts the hope among rivals that Mr. Sanders had maxed out a limited, if impassioned, minority of the party when he ran four years ago.\u201cThere\u2019s an assumption he\u2019s relying on that loyal base of support from 2016,\u201d said Jen Psaki, a Democratic strategist and former White House communications director for President Barack Obama. But a rush of new donors \u201cwould make people question the assumption that Bernie supporters are solely Bernie loyalists from 2016, end of story,\u201d she said.VideoSenator Bernie Sanders is embarking on a second run for president. This time the field will be bigger, more diverse and filled with candidates who have adopted his progressive populist mantle.CreditCreditSam Hodgson for The New York TimesMr. Sanders raised $73 million in 2015. This year, he entered the race roughly 70 days earlier in the calendar and raised four times as much on his first day, raising the possibility of a $100 million haul in 2019.Hillary Clinton, who beat Mr. Sanders in the 2016 primary, raised more than him in that race. But that was with the weight of the Democratic Party establishment behind her, a huge list of supporters from her 2008 run and four million more names from a group called Ready for Hillary that had gathered grass-roots supporters ahead of her campaign.No 2020 rival of Mr. Sanders has anything close to that.In a move that seemed designed to compete with Mr. Sanders for small donors, Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign announced on Monday that she would forgo all traditional private fund-raisers and one-on-one meetings with big donors.Mr. Rabin-Havt tried to tamp down long-term financial expectations for the Sanders campaign. \u201cIt will be remarkable to emulate those 2015 numbers again,\u201d he said.Separately, Mr. Sanders said during a town hall-style forum on CNN Monday night that he would release 10 years of tax returns \u201csoon,\u201d suggesting he would provide more transparency into his taxes than he did in 2016 when he only released one year of filings. Mr. Sanders said he did not release more returns then because \u201cI didn\u2019t win the nomination.\u201d\u201cOur tax returns will bore you to death,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing special about them.\u201dMoney alone is not determinative in presidential politics. In the 2016 Republican primary, a super PAC supporting Jeb Bush burned through $100 million as Mr. Bush finished no better than fourth in any of the first three states. But money does pay for television ads and field staff, and Mr. Sanders\u2019s fund-raising advantage will allow him to take risks and make investments others cannot afford.\u201cHe can build a ground game not just in the first four primary states but into the Super Tuesday states,\u201d Ms. Psaki said. \u201cHe can expand his playing field in places like California.\u201dThe Sanders campaign shared new statistics on its donors so far, which skew younger than is typical. An internal analysis showed more than 108,000 of Mr. Sanders\u2019s first day contributors were 39 years old or younger, and they gave a combined $2.5 million of the $5.9 million raised. The most common age for a Sanders contributor was 30. Relatedly, more than $3 million of the donations that first day came from mobile devices, a sign of both shifting habits and the relative youth of his donor base. The campaign did not provide a breakdown by gender.Mr. Sanders has closely tracked his fund-raising haul, campaign officials said, and Mr. Rabin-Havt said that the senator wrote much of the campaign\u2019s initial 1,400-word email announcement himself.The email did not explicitly ask for money, instead directing people to sign a petition supporting Mr. Sanders. Of those who signed, about 40 percent also contributed, his campaign said.Mr. Sanders\u2019s two top digital advisers in 2020, Tim Tagaris and Robin Curran, are both veterans of his 2016 run, but others from that team are on or expected to join other campaigns.Mr. Rabin-Havt noted the universe of Democratic donors was still growing. \u201cWe haven\u2019t hit a diminishing rate of return on this yet,\u201d he said.He added that the Sanders campaign believes it has a unique advantage.\u201cThe secret sauce for Bernie Sanders fund-raising,\u201d he said, \u201cis Bernie.\u201d"}, {"title": "California Doesn\u2019t Like Trump.

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.[Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.]Last January, Gavin Newsom called on President Trump to resign, describing him as \u201ca joke and a racist.\u201dOh, the changes a year \u2014 and a boost to the governor\u2019s mansion \u2014 can bring.\u201cThat was during a campaign,\u201d Mr. Newsom told me this weekend, saying he couldn\u2019t quite remember what, exactly, he felt Mr. Trump should resign over. \u201cIt\u2019s just so indicative of this moment, I couldn\u2019t even tell you. It was 4,623 tweets ago.\u201dI sat down with Mr. Newsom while he was in Washington for an annual conference of governors. Now the governor of California, he acknowledged how important it was that he find a way to work with the president \u2014 even one who\u2019s disliked by the majority of voters in his state.As the country\u2019s most populous state, California politics always play an outsized role on the national stage. During the Trump era, it has become the vanguard of the Democratic Party, a testing ground for policies, lawsuits and political tactics designed to promote a progressive agenda and undercut the administration.One in eight Americans lives in California. Two-thirds of residents disapprove of the president.But Mr. Newsom needs Mr. Trump \u2014 or at least his federal dollars.In November, Mr. Newsom, Mr. Trump and then-Gov. Jerry Brown toured devastation caused by the Camp Fire, which burned most of the town of Paradise, killed more than 80 people and destroyed nearly 14,000 homes. Mr. Trump promised then to work with Mr. Newsom; two months later, the president threatened to cut off federal aid to wildfire victims.So, is it possible for the leader of the \u201cstate of resistance,\u201d who bashed Mr. Trump relentlessly during the campaign, to have a productive relationship with the president?\u201cI hope so,\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The two exchanged little more than pleasantries during a dinner Mr. Trump hosted for governors at the White House on Sunday.\u201cBut I\u2019m pursuing that because it\u2019s just it\u2019s too damn important,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd the risks are too great to bear.\u201dOver the past week, the relationship between Mr. Trump and California seems to have hit a new low. A day after the state joined 15 others in filing a lawsuit challenging the president\u2019s emergency declaration on the border, the Transportation Department said it was looking into ways to claw back $2.5 billion in federal funds it had already spent on the state\u2019s high-speed rail network.Mr. Trump lashed out on Twitter, writing that California, \u201cthe state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control Fast Train, with no hope of completion, seems in charge\u201d of the lawsuit. Mr. Newsom fired back, calling the Transportation Department\u2019s move \u201cpolitical retribution.\u201dThen, two days later, the administration said it was ending negotiations with California over the president\u2019s plan to undo Obama-era fuel efficiency standards.The timing of that announcement was awfully \u201ccurious,\u201d said Mr. Newsom, who stressed that negotiations over the standards have been largely unproductive for months.But despite Mr. Newsom\u2019s professed desire to work with the president, the politics of the feud could benefit both men. The governor knows that the Democrats who voted him into office crave confrontation with Mr. Trump. And for Republicans, railing on the ills of California has become a red-meat rallying cry, citing the state as a symbol of high taxes, liberal social policy and lax immigration enforcement.\u201cWe\u2019re America\u2019s coming attraction, and for some people that\u2019s very livening. For others, it scares the hell out of them,\u201d said Mr. Newsom. \u201cI get it. I watch Tucker Carlson.\u201dDo you live in California?

We asked Edward Wong, a diplomatic correspondent for The Times, to explain to us what makes this summit different from the last. Here\u2019s what he told us:As I type this, sitting on a United Airlines flight bound for the tropics of Southeast Asia, President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are both on their own planes en route to the same destination. The rendezvous point is Hanoi, where Mr. Trump is expected to meet with Kim Jong-un, the young leader of North Korea. It will be their second summit. But more is at stake this time \u2014 the two nations must find a way to take significant steps toward the general goals outlined in the joint communiqu\u00e9 from their first meeting, including denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, or they risk having the ongoing diplomacy fall apart.ImageCreditKCNA, via KNS, via Associated PressMr. Trump has entrusted Mr. Pompeo with laying the groundwork for a successful summit. Mr. Pompeo and his diplomats have taken that to heart, trying to negotiate what are called \u201cdeliverables\u201d \u2014 concrete things, given by one side to the other, that are announced to tie a neat bow on a summit. It is not an easy task for Mr. Pompeo: My colleague David Sanger and I wrote a profile of his struggles with the challenges to his hard-line foreign policy vision from North Korea, Iran, Venezuela and even American allies.North Korea presents a vexing problem that is, in part, the doing of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s boss. With an eye toward the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr. Trump has declared on Twitter that North Korea is \u201cno longer a nuclear threat\u201d and said he and Mr. Kim \u201cfell in love.\u201d On Sunday, Mr. Trump told a gathering of governors at the White House that he was \u201chappy\u201d as long as North Korea did not do nuclear tests, which it halted in late 2017. Mr. Pompeo directly contradicted the president\u2019s earlier statement when he told Jake Tapper of CNN on Sunday that North Korea was still a nuclear threat. Ever the loyal cabinet member \u2014 some would say mouthpiece \u2014 he tried to pretend Mr. Trump never mentioned the lack of nuclear threat, but Mr. Tapper presented him with the exact words from Mr. Trump.So how do you do diplomacy when the president\u2019s view of reality is starkly different than yours? To complicate matters, some White House officials \u2014 including John R. Bolton, the national security adviser \u2014 take an even more hard-line view of North Korea than Mr. Pompeo, and they are carefully watching whether Mr. Pompeo is moving the goal posts on full denuclearization. Already, Mr. Pompeo\u2019s envoy has signaled that a declaration of nuclear assets from the North can take place later in the process, a shift in the American negotiating position.And what does the North Korean leader think of all this? In a speech last Friday at Stanford, Andrew Kim, a recently retired C.I.A. official on North Korea, recalled remarkable words he and Mr. Pompeo heard from the young leader during a visit to Pyongyang last April. Kim Jong-un, replying to Mr. Pompeo asking him whether he was truly ready to give up nuclear weapons, said: \u201cI\u2019m a father and a husband. And I have children. And I don\u2019t want my children to carry the nuclear weapon on their back their whole life.\u201dRead Edward\u2019s latest story: Defender of World Order or Trump Mouthpiece?

So when she returned to the state on Saturday, she had a much more precise answer ready when asked about universal health care.\u201cIn my vision of \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019 there would be a phasing in of it, and there would still be the option to have private insurance for the purposes of supplemental coverage,\u201d she told a voter in suburban Des Moines whose question had actually been about how best to finance a single-payer system.Few other Democratic presidential hopefuls have enjoyed as splashy a start as Ms. Harris has: She drew 20,000 people to her formal campaign launch in Oakland, Calif.; raised $1.5 million in her first full day in the race; and has been talked about on social media more than any of her rivals, vaulting to the top tier of the rapidly growing field.But the candidate is still catching up to the campaign \u2014 and not just on health care policy.On issues ranging from breaking up big technology companies to the crisis in Venezuela to reparations for African-Americans \u2014 and even the allegations against the actor Jussie Smollett \u2014 Ms. Harris has not offered positions when asked, had to clarify her views and softened her previous comments.It is hardly unusual for candidates to stumble or appear ill at ease at the outset of the grueling political crucible that is a presidential campaign; even former President Barack Obama, who is remembered as a political phenom, struggled at times in the early weeks of the 2008 campaign.[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]But the scrutiny has grown even more intense since that race, and the margin for error is minuscule in a field with so many candidates.With the growth of political news outlets, the rise of social media, and the global interest surrounding President Trump and his re-election, high-profile candidates do not have the luxury of honing their stump speeches before a few dozen voters, and even fewer reporters, in a cozy Concord living room.Instead, there have been hundreds of attendees at many of the early gatherings featuring the best-known candidates \u2014 as well as dozens of writers and photographers eager to capture every moment.\u201cThere is no on-ramp today,\u201d said Stephanie Cutter, a top aide in John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s instantaneous, which means it is harder for the candidates to work out their positions or decide their positions.\u201dImageMs. Harris hugged supporters during an event with the Iowa Democratic Black Caucus in Des Moines on Saturday.CreditRachel Mummey for The New York TimesIn this environment, it is perhaps not surprising that Ms. Harris\u2019s first response on private health care echoed as loudly as it did. It was not just because of the implications for the nearly 60 percent of Americans who receive employer-based insurance \u2014 it was also because she made her remarks on live national television.Past campaigns did not feature made-for-cable-TV town halls more than a year before the first primary.Yet health care is not the only issue Ms. Harris, who was elected in 2016 to represent California in the Senate, has handled with uncertainty since she entered the race.Asked Saturday morning about the growing tensions in Venezuela, and specifically how to get aid into the country and whether America should consider using force there, she offered a brief answer with few particulars.\u201cWe need to take it very seriously,\u201d Ms. Harris told reporters. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know that at this point we need to, and I would not condone, military action at this point.\u201dLater that afternoon, though, she offered a more detailed response on Twitter about what she called \u201ca crisis\u201d stemming from President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s rule.\u201cAs President, I would immediately extend TPS status to Venezuelans,\u201d she said, referring to temporary protected status for migrants. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do. America must show moral leadership in this hemisphere.\u201d[Who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out, who\u2019s still thinking: Check out our candidate tracker.]On reparations, Ms. Harris said, \u201cYes, I am,\u201d in a radio interview this month when she was asked if she was in favor of what her interviewer called \u201csome type of reparations\u201d for black Americans affected by slavery.But when asked in another interview last week to be more specific, she highlighted her tax proposal for middle-class families, a more universal approach that is inconsistent with the definition of reparations.\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and say I\u2019m going to do something that\u2019s only going to benefit black people,\u201d Ms. Harris told theGrio, a news website focused on African-American issues.In other instances, she appears uneasy committing to a policy at all, perhaps sensing a political hazard.On Saturday, for example, an Iowan asked Ms. Harris if she would favor eliminating the filibuster if Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress and the presidency, to more easily push through the party\u2019s agenda. The urgent necessity of doing so has become an article of faith to many on the left.She initially joked that she wanted to change the subject, twice allowed that she was \u201cconflicted\u201d and did not offer a direct answer. \u201cSorry I can\u2019t give you more than that right now,\u201d she told the voter.ImagePeople listened to Ms. Harris during a podcast recording in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Sunday.CreditJordan Gale for The New York TimesSimilarly, when a reporter asked Ms. Harris last month on her first campaign trip to South Carolina about Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s suggestion that technology giants like Amazon should be subject to antitrust laws, the California senator sidestepped the issue, which is a delicate matter in her state. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about what she\u2019s proposing, but I\u2019m happy to follow up with you,\u201d Ms. Harris said twice.At a voter forum in Des Moines on Saturday, Ms. Harris said she did not want to be pegged in any fixed ideological category \u2014 a posture that can frustrate some progressive Democrats.\u201cThat was evasive,\u201d said Ed Fallon, a liberal Iowa activist who attended the forum. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that she wasn\u2019t being clear.\u201dHer how-will-it-play hesitation is also frustrating to some more pragmatic Democrats who believe the candidates should not try to meet some imagined standard of ideological orthodoxy.\u201cThey\u2019re playing too assiduously to the critics of Twitter,\u201d said Paul Begala, the longtime Democratic strategist. \u201cAnd the truth is that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dMr. Begala said party activists were overwhelmingly fixated on defeating Mr. Trump and were unlikely to penalize a candidate if they think he or she is up to that job.\u201cThe scrutiny is far more harsh this time, but the voters are much more forgiving if they think you can win,\u201d he said.Yet her response to the Smollett case may only reinforce her instinct for caution.Immediately after the actor, a gay African-American, said he had been attacked in Chicago by a pair of Trump supporters in what he described as a hate crime, Ms. Harris wrote on Twitter that the incident represented \u201can attempted modern day lynching.\u201dBut after the Chicago police last week accused Mr. Smollett of staging the attack and charged him with filing a false police report, Ms. Harris was caught flat-footed. Reminded by a reporter that she had called the case a \u201cmodern day lynching,\u201d she appeared to look back toward her aides before offering a halting answer.\u201cI think the facts are still unfolding,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about obviously the initial allegation that he made about what might have happened.\u201dThe good news for Ms. Harris and all the Democratic candidates, Ms. Cutter said, is that \u201cit\u2019s O.K. not to have a position today\u201d on some issues.\u201cVoters just need to know you\u2019re thinking about issues and are intellectually curious,\u201d she said.That kind of leeway, she said, will disappear in just over three months, when candidates gather for the first Democratic debate.\u201cWhen they have to stand onstage next to each other and debate each other, platitudes aren\u2019t going to win the day,\u201d said Ms. Cutter."}, {"title": "Architects of Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 Race Part Ways With 2020 Campaign", "category": "Politics", "id": "68406fbe-c9bd-4ed0-9c9f-872cc78c7c83", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-consultants.html", "publishdate": 20190226, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/27/us/politics/27SANDERS-print/merlin_104892625_546bf309-9aa6-4025-a333-e5e943d751b2-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The architects of the 2016 insurgent campaign for Senator Bernie Sanders abruptly parted ways with his 2020 campaign on Tuesday, dealing him a surprise blow one week after he entered the presidential race with an emphatic show of fund-raising strength.The consultants, Tad Devine, Julian Mulvey and Mark Longabaugh, said in a statement that they were \u201cleaving because we believe that Senator Sanders deserves to have media consultants who share his creative vision for the campaign.\u201dTheir decision was unexpected: The three produced the announcement video that Mr. Sanders released last week, which has helped him raise $10 million, and they had been intimately involved in the planning of a second White House bid for the Vermont senator.The rupture infuriated some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters, who feared it would detract from a stunning financial haul that they had hoped would quiet the doubters about a second Sanders candidacy. The shake-up was also the latest indication that Mr. Sanders is going to run a different kind of race this time around \u2014 or at least, that his advisers want him to do so.In a brief interview, Mr. Longabaugh said he and his partners, who produced some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s most memorable 2016 ads, had strategic differences with the senator and his wife, Jane, who is his closest adviser. \u201cWe came to realize this was just not going to work,\u201d he said, noting that the disagreements \u201cbuilt over time.\u201dMr. Longabaugh, who said he told Mr. Sanders this morning of the decision, would not specify the nature of the disagreements.But after running a highly improvisational campaign against Hillary Clinton, Mr. Sanders has been taking steps toward a more sophisticated and modern race this time.The current team said Mr. Sanders was concerned about spending too much money on television ads. And the campaign officials indicated they would devote far more time and attention to building up a national organization, as well as ones in early nominating states, and would pour money into digital organizing efforts.Mr. Sanders has also hired a new campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, the former A.C.L.U. political director, and the three consultants had little say in the decision to replace his 2016 manager, Jeff Weaver.Mr. Shakir, who did not know that the strategists were planning to quit, had not even yet met with them. Mr. Sanders\u2019s new team said little about the surprise exit of the consultants\u2019 firm, known as Devine, Mulvey and Longabaugh. \u201cThe campaign appreciates all the good work DML has done and wishes them well,\u201d said Mr. Shakir in a statement.Privately, Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters were irritated and suggested the consultants walked away because they were not going to have the same influence as they did four years ago.Mr. Longabaugh dismissed that claim, noting that advertising firms are by their nature central to modern campaigns and that Mr. Sanders would inevitably have come to rely on their long experience in Democratic politics.The senator clashed at times with his consulting team in 2016 \u2014 particularly Mr. Devine, and particularly at the end of the race when it was clear that Mr. Sanders could not win the nomination \u2014 but Mr. Mulvey and Mr. Longabaugh had been expected to play central roles in 2020. For months, they had been making the case that Mr. Sanders should not be underestimated.But on Tuesday, Mr. Longabaugh would not rule out the firm working for another Democratic candidate. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about that so I\u2019m not going to comment,\u201d he said.[Who\u2019s in? Who\u2019s out? Keep up with the 2020 Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]Mr. Sanders, who struggled to win African-Americans voters, has made clear that he wanted a more diverse array of campaign advisers after largely surrounding himself with white men in 2016. The three consultants departing are all white, while Mr. Shakir will be the first Muslim in American history to run a presidential campaign.And Mr. Sanders will hold a series of rallies this weekend that nod to his biography \u2014 a marked contrast to his 2016 campaign, when he eschewed talking about himself and relentlessly focused on his progressive policy agenda. He is appearing in Brooklyn, where he was born, and in Chicago, where he went to college and joined civil rights protests. The weekend tour will include a stop in Selma, Ala., for events marking the anniversary of Bloody Sunday there.And while he may have a different group of advisers for this campaign, Mr. Sanders clearly retains the same grass-roots appeal: On his first day as a presidential candidate, he raised nearly $6 million, and on Monday, six days after he joined the 2020 race, campaign officials said he had secured $10 million from 359,914 donors."}, {"title": "Restoring an Avenue in Paris Meant for Kings", "category": "Business", "id": "a7959742-f4cc-4c62-9eb4-6a4229511214", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/business/paris-champs-elysees-renovation.html", "publishdate": 20190226, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/27/business/27CHAMPSELYSEES-03/27CHAMPSELYSEES-03-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "PARIS \u2014 The sidewalks are cracked along \u201cla plus belle avenue du monde\u201d \u2014 the most beautiful street in the world.

But its last major renovation was more than 20 years ago. New retail tenants have been intermittent. Parisians avoid the area with the resolution of New Yorkers steering clear of Times Square.As Paris prepares to host the 2024 Olympics, hundreds of millions of dollars are flowing into construction projects on the avenue, one of the most visited areas of the city, as it tries to re-establish and redefine its place.Apple and WeWork moved in recently, and will be followed by the Galeries Lafayette department store.

Commercial rents along the promenade are among the highest in the world, at $1,519 per square foot per year, compared with $2,250 on Fifth Avenue, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Construction in the Beaux-Arts buildings that line the street is heavily regulated, and any changes made to accommodate tourists and global chains risk further alienating locals.Without the renovation, Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\u2019 risks losing its prestige as a world-class destination, said Jean-Louis Missika, the deputy mayor of Paris for urban planning and economic development.The Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es ranks among grand boulevards such as Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills and Oxford Street in London. Other streets, such as Des Voeux Road in Hong Kong and Khao San Road in Bangkok, are trying to position themselves as major attractions.The avenue, stretching nearly 1.2 miles from Place de la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe, has inspired streets in the Bronx, New Orleans, Prague and, recently, Tokyo.

Napoleon III added fountains and pathways in the 1800s. Later in the 19th century, a regionwide urban design overhaul led by Baron Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann erected the uniform stone buildings that still populate many Parisian streets.Parisians celebrated their city\u2019s liberation from the Nazis in 1944 and their nation\u2019s World Cup victories there. A restoration in the 1990s widened sidewalks, added trees and moved parking underground. But the glamorous charm that made the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es a quintessentially Parisian street has waned.The theaters that dot the avenue have shed millions of moviegoers. Shopping arcades set farther back from the street are often deserted. The Arc de Triomphe, a testament to military might that has become a monumental symbol of the extreme affluence and global consumerism in its shadow, was recently vandalized by so-called yellow vest protesters objecting to high taxes and income disparity.In 2007, the city government, wanting to resist the \u201cbanalization\u201d of the strip, tried to block H & M from opening an outlet on the avenue. The fast-fashion chain arrived anyway, along with two Zara stores and an Abercrombie & Fitch housed in a sumptuous mansion behind a gilded gate.\u201cHaving always the same brands, it\u2019s not good for the place, because people don\u2019t know where they are,\u201d Mr. Missika said. \u201cThey could be in London or Tokyo.\u201dImageThe improvement project is a complicated undertaking, in part because construction in the Beaux-Arts buildings that line the street is heavily regulated.CreditElliott Verdier for The New York TimesIdeally, he said, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es would host a balanced mix of fast-food outlets, sit-down restaurants, global retailers and local designers. But the city has few legal tools to shape the commercial composition of the street.\u201cThere must be a good equilibrium of commercial activity,\u201d Mr. Missika said. \u201cWhen a place is totally deserted by local people, it\u2019s a big problem; the soul of the city disappears.\u201dThe Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es is being repopulated by tenants that hope to draw both Parisians and tourists.A 70,000-square-foot extension of the Galeries Lafayette chain will open between Rue La Bo\u00e9tie and Rue du Colis\u00e9e at the end of March, becoming the largest retail site on the street.The nearly 90-year-old property, a former bank, is owned by the Qatar Investment Authority. The Danish architect Bjarke Ingels uncovered a hidden cupola and crafted a vortex-like entrance into the four-story store.

Helen Mirren and Jane Fonda strutted down the middle of the street for a 2017 fashion show.Last year, the city began constructing a dedicated bike lane on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, which it expects to complete by early 2020. A government effort \u2014 with an assist by Chanel \u2014 to upgrade and expand the exhibition and event spaces at the Grand Palais will start next year.There is also talk of sprucing up the gardens along the eastern part of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, where Jeff Koons\u2019s towering 35-foot-tall sculpture \u201cBouquet of Tulips\u201d will be permanently placed this year.

But Mike Manley, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s chief executive, said he was confident that the American economy would remain on track.\u201cThe economic indicators as we see them are still strong,\u201d he said in a conference call with reporters.He also noted that the updated plants would produce three large Jeep models \u2014 vehicles that are experiencing growth as consumers gravitate toward sport utility vehicles and increasingly abandon sedans. The plan, Mr. Manley said, \u201cis an investment in Jeep as our core brand.\u201dThe Jeep brand has benefited as American consumers have flocked to S.U.V.s and other roomier vehicles, and have turned away from sedans and compacts. In 2018, two-thirds of new vehicles sold nationwide were classified as trucks, up from half in 2013.Overall new-vehicle sales in the United States are expected to be lower this year, and the pace of Jeep sales has slowed in the first two months of the year, leaving dealers with heavy inventories. As of Feb. 1, Fiat Chrysler had enough Jeeps on dealer lots to last 166 days, up from 116 on Jan. 1.ImageFiat Chrysler plans to update the Jefferson North plant to make the next-generation Grand Cherokee as well as the Dodge Durango, adding 1,000 jobs.CreditRebecca Cook/Reuters\u201cI think there is some risk for FCA,\u201d said Charles Chesbrough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are expecting the market to collapse, but it is slowing down.\u201dThe plan is the first major initiative announced by Mr. Manley, who was named chief executive in July after his predecessor, Sergio Marchionne, died unexpectedly after shoulder surgery. Mr. Manley had headed the Jeep brand under Mr. Marchionne.Fiat Chrysler intends to convert its Mack Avenue Engine plant in Detroit to produce a new seven-passenger Jeep model and the new version of its Jeep Grand Cherokee, a move that will add 3,850 jobs. Mr. Manley said construction would start in the second quarter. Plans for the plant\u2019s conversion had surfaced in news reports in December.The company will also update another Detroit plant, known as Jefferson North, to be able to make the next-generation Grand Cherokee as well as the Dodge Durango, another S.U.V., creating 1,000 additional jobs. A third plant in Warren, Mich., that currently makes an older version of the Ram 1500 pickup truck will be modified to also make two other new vehicles \u2014 the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer. That will bring 1,400 jobs to the Warren factory.Mr. Manley said the plant modifications would allow Fiat Chrysler to start making electric versions of its Jeep models, if customer demand increased.While the company is expanding in Michigan, it said it would lay off 1,371 of the 5,464 workers at its plant in Belvidere, Ill. The factory, where Fiat Chrysler makes Jeep Cherokees, employs three crews of workers, and runs two 10-hour shifts six days a week. The job cuts will take effect May 6, after which the plant will operate two eight-hour shifts five days a week.A Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman said the carmaker had no plans to transfer Belvidere workers to the Michigan plants where jobs are being added.Fiat Chrysler was ahead of most of its competitors when it stopped making sedans in 2016 to focus on pickups, S.U.V.s and other large vehicles, whose sales were rising as gasoline prices declined.

Talk to menDealBook exclusive: The energy company plans to announce today that it has given $5 million to Catalyst, a nonprofit focused on making corporate America more hospitable toward women.It\u2019s funding Men Advocating Real Change, a Catalyst campaign that teaches male executives how to improve diversity and inclusion at their companies. (Among its tactics: lessons on unconscious bias.) Lorraine Hariton, Catalyst\u2019s C.E.O., said it was the single biggest grant in the nonprofit\u2019s 50-year history.Chevron has been a longtime supporter of Catalyst. It began working with the nonprofit 20 years ago, and Mike Wirth, the oil and gas giant\u2019s C.E.O., helped introduce this program to the company two years ago. It now runs in seven Chevron offices worldwide.Diversity and inclusion has improved at Chevron. In 2010, only 6 percent of its board and 11 percent of its management committee were women. Now, it\u2019s 36 percent for the board and 20 percent for the management committee. \u201cI think the business case for this is compelling,\u201d Mr. Wirth told Michael de la Merced of DealBook, saying more diversity has improved innovation.But there\u2019s still a lot to do. Mr. Wirth said that oil and gas needed far more women in engineering and technical roles. And Ms. Hariton said that while companies have been hiring more women, the number of top female executives remains too small.As Trump softens on China, critics circlePresident Trump is facing increasing pressure from Republicans, Democrats and even some of his own advisers to win the kind of large concessions that Beijing has long resisted, Alan Rappeport of the NYT writes.Mr. Trump has softened his threats against China. \u201cCiting \u2018substantial progress\u2019 in talks between the United States and China, Mr. Trump on Sunday evening halted plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods at the end of this week,\u201d Mr. Rappeport explains.But the Chinese may be dangling false promises, some top Democrats say, in hopes of ending a trade war that is damaging their economy, as well as hurting American farmers. Some Republicans fear that Mr. Trump may settle for a deal that simply reduces the trade deficit and offers relief to Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant.Many big sticking points remain, including China\u2019s state subsidies for its businesses. Beijing also still appears to be falling short of the administration\u2019s demands over intellectual property and cybertheft.\u201cThe blowback from both directions may leave Mr. Trump little choice but to keep the threat of tariffs alive so that he can continue to claim he\u2019s being tough on China, analysts said,\u201d according to Mr. Rappeport.More: The FT imagines what a trade deal might look like. Trade war is only one of the threats worrying President Xi Jinping of Chin. U.S. companies are planning their lowest rate of expansion in China since 2016. And a delay on further tariffs probably staved off inflation in America.ImageElon MuskCreditDavid Mcnew/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesElon Musk\u2019s tweets anger the S.E.C., againThe Securities and Exchange Commission says a series of tweets Elon Musk published last week violate its agreement with Tesla, and wants him held in contempt of court.Mr. Musk got in trouble last year by tweeting that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private, when that wasn\u2019t exactly the case. Tesla settled, promising the S.E.C. that it would set up \u201cmandatory procedures to oversee and preapprove Mr. Musk\u2019s Tesla-related written communications.\u201dThen last week, he tweeted about a manufacturing triumph, saying Tesla would make \u201caround 500,000\u201d cars this year, up from a target of 400,000. He soon corrected himself and repeated the target of 400,000 deliveries. Tesla\u2019s lawyers conceded that Mr. Musk hadn\u2019t had his tweets reviewed, but argued \u201cthe substance\u201d of his post had already been vetted and publicly disclosed. Mr. Musk followed up by needling the S.E.C., tweeting that it \u201cforgot to read Tesla earnings transcript,\u201d in which he forecast production of between 350,000 and 500,000 cars. \u201cHow embarrassing,\u201d he added.\u201cThis is not an innocuous tweet,\u201d Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School, told the NYT. \u201cInsiders have to be careful about revealing misleading information to the public.\u201dPunishments the S.E.C. could seek, Ms. Roiphe said, include a fine, more restrictions on Mr. Musk\u2019s social media use, or even his removal as C.E.O.Is the game changing on Brexit?With just over a month to go before Britain is scheduled to leave the E.U., Prime Minister Theresa May could U-turn on her commitment to keeping to schedule. And the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, under heavy pressure, has promised to support a second public vote.Mrs. May is letting her cabinet think the unthinkable. The prime minister, who has repeatedly insisted that Brexit will occur on March 29, will allow her colleagues \u201cto discuss extending the deadline\u201d today, according to Bloomberg, which sets out what she\u2019d be risking and why:\u2022 \u201cOn one hand, it would avert mass resignations from pro-E.U. ministers in May\u2019s team, and potentially a defeat in Parliament this week.\u201d\u2022 \u201cBut it would also risk a destabilizing backlash from Euroskeptic Conservatives.\u201dAnd Mr. Corbyn has made a big concession to pro-Europeans. He had long resisted a second Brexit referendum, but has had to reconsider after several pro-E.U. lawmakers quit his Labour Party. Stephen Castle of the NYT explains what the reversal means:\u2022 \u201cAt the moment, it is unlikely that a second vote would win a majority in Parliament because most lawmakers still oppose the idea.\u201d\u2022 \u201cBut if Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit plan is rejected next month for a second time, then the calculation in Parliament could change.\u201dThe misery of Facebook\u2019s moderatorsDozens of current and former employees of a company called Cognizant, which reviews content for the social network, spoke to the Verge.

(He has also pushed the firm into safe businesses, de-emphasizing the risk-taking that left Merrill needing a buyer.)The only place where staying as Merrill made sense was in wealth management.

With the political landscape shifting in sometimes startling ways, what was once an obscure idea has gained broader relevance.But while the term has been bandied about lately, it hasn\u2019t always been by people who know what they\u2019re talking about. And it\u2019s important to get this right. You\u2019ve probably noticed that policies once dismissed out of hand \u2014 from \u201cMedicare for all\u201d to a 70 percent top tax rate; from sweeping action on climate change to abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 are being discussed in mainstream circles now. The Overton window is a useful way to understand what\u2019s happening.Joseph P. Overton introduced the concept in the 1990s as an executive at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a conservative think tank in Michigan. He never expected it to gain widespread recognition, said Joseph G. Lehman, president of the Mackinac Center, and it didn\u2019t until after Mr. Overton died in 2003.Mr. Overton just wanted to explain to potential donors what the point of a think tank was, so he created a brochure with a cardboard slider. The brochure listed the range of possible policies on a single issue, from least to most government intervention. On education \u2014 an example the Mackinac Center uses \u2014 it might run from zero public investment in education to compulsory indoctrination in government schools. But neither of those extremes is going to happen. Only part of the range is achievable, and when Mr. Overton moved his slider, different policies fell into what he called the window of political possibility.\u201cPublic officials cannot enact any policy they please like they\u2019re ordering dessert from a menu,\u201d Mr. Lehman said in an interview. \u201cThey have to choose from among policies that are politically acceptable at the time. And we believe the Overton window defines that range of ideas.\u201dGrass-roots mobilization can shift the window. So can think tanks, which was Mr. Overton\u2019s point. But despite a misconception driven by Glenn Beck\u2019s novel \u201cThe Overton Window,\u201d the window is a description, not a tactic: Shifting it doesn\u2019t mean proposing extreme ideas to make somewhat less extreme ideas seem reasonable.ImageJoseph P. Overton was an executive at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy in the 1990s when he introduced the concept now known as the Overton window. He died in 2003.Creditvia The Mackinac Center for Public Policy\u201cIt just explains how ideas come in and out of fashion, the same way that gravity explains why something falls to the earth,\u201d Mr. Lehman said. \u201cI can use gravity to drop an anvil on your head, but that would be wrong. I could also use gravity to throw you a life preserver; that would be good.\u201dThe key is that shifts begin with the public. Mr. Overton argued that the role of organizations like his own was not to lobby politicians to support policies outside the window, but to convince voters that policies outside the window should be in it. If they are successful, an idea derided as unthinkable can become so inevitable that it\u2019s hard to believe it was ever otherwise.The current shift toward progressive economic policies is clear and quantifiable. Take some of the legislation introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders, whose 2016 presidential campaign helped popularize these ideas. In 2015, his bills to make public colleges free and expand Social Security had no co-sponsors in the Senate. Two years later, they had seven and 17, respectively, in addition to 50 and 133 co-sponsors in the House. His signature measure, the Medicare for All Act, had no Senate co-sponsors in 2013 (he didn\u2019t introduce it in 2015), but four years later it had 16, along with 125 in the House.\u201cWe have come a very, very long way in the American people now demanding legislation and concepts that just a few years ago were thought to be very radical,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a recent interview.His support for these policies set him apart in the 2016 Democratic field, but they are mainstream positions among the 2020 candidates \u2014 because, increasingly, they are mainstream positions among the voters those candidates are courting. Mr. Sanders emphasized as much in announcing his second presidential campaign on Tuesday.Most telling, perhaps, is that even opponents are taking the ideas seriously: They might not want Medicare for all, but they believe it could happen and are fighting it accordingly. If a policy is dead on arrival, you don\u2019t have to fight it.That the Overton window is shifting doesn\u2019t necessarily mean policies like Medicare for all will be enacted, and it doesn\u2019t say anything about whether they are good or bad. But it does say something meaningful about the political climate.ImageMany of the ideas Senator Bernie Sanders proposed during his presidential campaign in 2016 have since been adopted by large numbers of Democrats.CreditSam Hodgson for The New York TimesPart of the story is polarization: Democrats moving left and Republicans right, to an extent \u201cthat we haven\u2019t seen previously in a modern political period,\u201d said Mary Layton Atkinson, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte who studies public opinion and issue framing. \u201cRepublicans have become just as entrenched in their own conservative policy preferences.\u201dAs support for more ambitious policies has increased among Democrats, there has also been \u201ca wave of young party leaders who are less encumbered by a long voting history tying them to more moderate and less progressive policy stances,\u201d Dr. Atkinson said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re being supported by a base that is ready to hear these messages.\u201dBut polarization isn\u2019t the only factor. Polls show that some support crosses the partisan divide. Forty-five percent of Republicans in one poll supported Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s suggestion to tax income over $10 million at 70 percent; among all American adults, 59 percent supported that. Thirty-seven percent of Republicans said they would vote for a candidate who supported a Medicare for all plan; 53 percent of all Americans said the same.Leaders like Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez argue that voters are rejecting longstanding economic assumptions because those assumptions haven\u2019t yielded the promised results. \u201cI think the line of trickle-down economics improving the lives of everybody doesn\u2019t work when in the last 30 or 40 years, the lives of the middle class have become significantly more difficult at the same time as we\u2019ve seen massive income and wealth inequality,\u201d Mr. Sanders said.That sentiment is far from universal, and many Americans still support \u201ctrickle-down\u201d policies. Conservatives and some moderates \u2014 including possible presidential candidates like Michael Bloomberg \u2014 view proposals like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d or a wealth tax as extreme, and it is not clear how those proposals would play in a presidential general election.But since Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is also running for president, began speaking on national stages about ideas once confined to small circles, criticism of those ideas has ceased to dominate the political conversation, and voters are seeing practicality in ideas long considered idealistic. (Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign did not make her available for an interview.)\u201cI think people like Warren and Sanders deserve a lot of credit for advancing these ideas before they were cool,\u201d said Tom Perriello, executive director for U.S. programs at the Open Society Foundations, who co-wrote an article last year about the increasing popularity of once-unthinkable policies. \u201cIt created a conversation people hadn\u2019t heard before, and then had the option to look at it and say, \u2018Wait, that sounds like a much better idea than what I\u2019ve been hearing before.\u2019\u201d"}, {"title": "U.S. Loses Appeal Seeking to Block AT&T-Time Warner Merger", "category": "Business", "id": "f53267dc-a2fe-4625-a5f3-eada79d06e6c", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/business/media/att-time-warner-appeal.html", "publishdate": 20190226, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/27/business/27att1/merlin_151006236_7318ac5b-5c9f-4107-ba91-decfffb3c0ee-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The federal government on Tuesday lost its second court challenge to AT&T\u2019s $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner, a blockbuster deal that has already begun to reshape much of the media industry.A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the government\u2019s claim that a lower court had applied antitrust laws incorrectly in allowing the merger to proceed. Justice Department lawyers have argued that the combination of the two companies would reduce competition and hurt consumers.\u201cThe government\u2019s objections that the District Court misunderstood and misapplied economic principles and clearly erred in rejecting the quantitative model are unpersuasive,\u201d Judge Judith W. Rogers wrote on behalf of the panel.The Justice Department does not plan another appeal, a spokesman for the agency, Jeremy Edwards, said. \u201cWe are grateful that the Court of Appeals considered our objections,\u201d he said.AT&T can now proceed with its plan to transform WarnerMedia into a streaming-video business in its version of the television industry\u2019s go-to strategy. The company has said it would unveil several online video products by early next year, with the premium cable channel HBO anchoring a service that would feature films and television shows from the Warner Bros. library. (HBO will continue to be available as a stand-alone service.)That means blockbuster movies like \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and installments of the Harry Potter franchise could show up on the service next to TV shows like \u201cFriends\u201d and HBO hits like \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d AT&T also plans to license some of its video properties to services like Netflix, a strategy that could undermine its own streaming product since audiences would be able to watch its shows and movies elsewhere.The appeals court ruling was a blow to the Justice Department and its lead antitrust regulator, Makan Delrahim, a conservative appointed by President Trump. Mr. Delrahim had sought a divestiture of some Time Warner assets as a condition of allowing the deal to go through, but AT&T\u2019s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, refused to make such concessions.In a statement, David McAtee, AT&T\u2019s general counsel, welcomed the appeals court\u2019s decision, which followed a lower-court ruling last June.\u201cThe merger of these innovative companies has already yielded significant consumer benefits, and it will continue to do so for years to come,\u201d Mr. McAtee said. \u201cWhile we respect the important role that the U.S. Department of Justice plays in the merger review process, we trust that today\u2019s unanimous decision from the D.C. Circuit will end this litigation.\u201dBy challenging the transaction in court, the Justice Department signaled that it would have an aggressive approach to so-called vertical mergers between companies with complementary businesses.In the case of AT&T and Time Warner, which has been renamed WarnerMedia, the wireless provider is considered a content distributor and the media business a content supplier. AT&T said that because the companies did not compete, the merger would yield benefits for customers like lower bills and new shows tailored for mobile devices.The deal brought together one of the nation\u2019s largest wireless providers with a vast media business that includes CNN in addition to HBO and Warner Bros. AT&T has over 153 million wireless subscribers and also owns the satellite TV service DirecTV.AT&T has been operating WarnerMedia as a separate group, making it easier to unwind the business if the Justice Department prevailed in court. The group will continue to operate as a separate division, but AT&T can now integrate it more deeply with the parent company. That will give AT&T executives direct control over Turner Broadcasting, which the Justice Department sought to force the company to sell as a condition of the deal.AT&T had agreed to take a hands-off approach to Turner during the appeal, but it can now make staff changes at the unit and take the lead in negotiating licensing deals with cable operators like Comcast or Charter. Turner includes CNN and the cable networks TNT and TBS, which own rights to broadcast games of major sports leagues like Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association.The merger attracted a significant amount of political interest. As a presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump, who has frequently criticized CNN as \u201cfake news,\u201d vowed to block the deal if he was elected \u201cbecause it\u2019s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.\u201dThe Justice Department has insisted that political considerations played no role in the decision to fight it.William P. Barr, who was confirmed as attorney general this month, was a member of the Time Warner board until June. He told senators at his confirmation hearing that he would recuse himself from the agency\u2019s efforts to dismantle the merger. Mr. Barr held more than $4.2 million worth of Time Warner stock at the end of March and sold his shares sometime before the end of June.The lower court\u2019s approval of Time Warner\u2019s merger with AT&T touched off an intense round of deal making. Comcast and the Walt Disney Company clashed in a fiercely contested bidding war for the bulk of 21st Century Fox, the media empire created by Rupert Murdoch.Disney eventually won, securing the rights to Mr. Murdoch\u2019s film studios, including 20th Century Fox, and several of his cable networks. Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, separately won a bid for the British satellite broadcaster Sky, which the Murdoch family had controlled. (Mr. Murdoch will continue to control Fox News and Fox broadcasting, as well as the sports network FS1 and the business network Fox Business.) CBS and Viacom, both controlled by the Redstone family, could pursue a merger this year.The government\u2019s approach to the AT&T-Time Warner merger contrasts sharply with its relatively quick approval of Disney\u2019s acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment properties. That agreement, which called for Disney to pay $71.3 billion for Fox\u2019s television and movie business, was approved in June, about six months after it was announced. Transactions of such size typically take a year or more.After AT&T closed the deal with Time Warner in June, it quickly appointed an executive to oversee the new acquisition. The move led some people to worry that the company would foist its mechanized methods onto Time Warner. But AT&T has said it plans to preserve the entertainment giant\u2019s culture of talent and creativity.AT&T also has to prove to its investors that it can pay off its staggering debt load of $171 billion, much more than most public companies carry. The company borrowed $40 billion to finance the Time Warner acquisition. Mr. Stephenson has said AT&T should be able to pay off about $30 billion of its debt this year.The wireless industry continues to face substantial challenges. The nation\u2019s four major carriers \u2014 AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint \u2014 have been locked in a price war for several years. Most people in the country already pay for mobile service, and the carriers have had to lower their prices to steal customers away from one another. That has reduced profits, prompting new strategies.AT&T bought Time Warner in a bid to hold on to customers by offering added products like HBO and other video services, either at discounted rates or as part of a package.Verizon has taken a different tack.

Again.The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday asked a federal court to hold Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla, in contempt of court for violating a settlement that he and the company reached with the commission last year. The S.E.C. said Mr. Musk issued an updated production outlook in a Twitter post on last Tuesday without first seeking approval from the company\u2019s lawyers as required under the agreement.It was the latest in a series of episodes, including the one that led to the settlement, that have renewed questions about Mr. Musk\u2019s judgment and the Tesla board\u2019s ability to oversee his actions.The commission sued Mr. Musk and Tesla last year over a Twitter post in which he said he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take the company private at $420 a share. It turned out that the plan to take the company private was in a much more embryonic state than his tweet indicated.The settlement required the company to establish \u201cmandatory procedures to oversee and preapprove Mr. Musk\u2019s Tesla-related written communications\u201d that might have material information. Mr. Musk was required to step down as chairman, and he and the company paid $20 million each in fines. The board named one of its members as chairwoman and appointed two new independent directors.At the crux of the commission\u2019s latest complaint are Mr. Musk\u2019s recent production claims.In the post last Tuesday, Mr. Musk forecast that the electric-car company would make \u201caround 500,000\u201d cars in 2019, a big increase from a target of 400,000 set at the end of January. About four hours later, Mr. Musk corrected himself, saying Tesla would indeed deliver 400,000 cars this year.\u201cMeant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k,\u201d he wrote.Tesla\u2019s lawyers acknowledged in a letter to the S.E.C. on Friday that Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets had not been reviewed before they were posted. They argued that he had believed that \u201cthe substance\u201d of his post \u201chad already been appropriately vetted, preapproved and publicly disseminated.\u201dIn the fourth-quarter earnings report released on Jan. 30, Tesla said it was \u201ctargeting annualized Model 3 output in excess of 500,000 units sometime between Q4 of 2019 and Q2 of 2020.\u201dBut in a motion filed Monday with Federal District Court in Manhattan, the S.E.C. said Mr. Musk had \u201cviolated the court\u2019s final judgment by engaging in the very conduct that the preapproval provision of the final judgment was designed to prevent.\u201d It added that Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet about producing 500,000 cars this year \u201cwas inaccurate and disseminated to over 24 million people\u201d \u2014 the number of followers Mr. Musk had on Twitter at the time.Mr. Musk defended himself on Twitter later on Monday. He said the S.E.C. \u201cforgot to read Tesla earnings transcript,\u201d in which he forecast production of between 350,000 and 500,000 cars. \u201cHow embarrassing,\u201d he wrote.Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School, said the commission\u2019s action \u201cis a fairly extreme step, but it is unsurprising, given that Musk seems so unconcerned not only about the agreement but about the policies behind the securities law.\u201d\u201cThis is not an innocuous tweet,\u201d she added. \u201cInsiders have to be careful about revealing misleading information to the public.\u201dMs. Roiphe said the motion could set the stage for the commission to later seek Mr. Musk\u2019s removal as chief executive if he further violated the agreement. The court could also decide to impose a fine, which is typical in civil cases such as this, or impose other restrictions on Mr. Musk\u2019s use of Twitter and other social media.The S.E.C. said in its motion that Mr. Musk had previously \u201cnot made a diligent or good faith effort to comply\u201d with the settlement. The commission cited an interview that Mr. Musk gave to the CBS News program \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d broadcast in December, in which he said he did not respect the S.E.C. and acknowledged that he did not have all his tweets reviewed.\u201cWell, I guess we might make some mistakes,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cWho knows?\u201dEarlier, in October, Mr. Musk mocked the S.E.C. on Twitter, calling it the Shortseller Enrichment Commission. He has long railed against hedge funds and other investors that bet that Tesla\u2019s stock will decline by selling its shares short.The day after Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets about the company\u2019s production goals appeared last week, Tesla\u2019s general counsel, Dane Butswinkas, left the company. He had been in the job just two months and had previously represented Mr. Musk in the settlement negotiations with the S.E.C.It is not clear whether Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets played any role in that departure. The company said Mr. Butswinkas had decided to return to his law firm, Williams & Connolly, in Washington.Tesla is also grappling with several other challenges. This week, it is scheduled to pay bondholders $920 million, a sum that would consume about a third of its cash.At the same time, the quality of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 has come under scrutiny. Last week, Consumer Reports dropped the Model 3 from its recommended list after readers reported cracked windows, chipped paint and problems with the car\u2019s large touch screen.Tesla sales also appear to be slowing. InsideEVs, an online publication that follows Tesla closely, estimated that the company sold only 6,500 cars in January, down from nearly 30,000 a month in the fourth quarter of last year.The company\u2019s stock was down more than 3 percent in extended trading after the S.E.C. filed its motion in court."}, {"title": "MWC 2019: Huawei Politics, Robots and Speedy 5G", "category": "Business", "id": "3aa56e5e-8903-4685-af8c-7ec13689c1dd", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/technology/mwc-2019-5g-huawei.html", "publishdate": 20190227, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/28/business/28mobileworld6/merlin_151320783_994a6d37-f73f-4acd-9dba-fa669298af99-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SectionsSkip to contentSkip to site index"}, {"title": "F.T.C.

The agency found a large percentage of the app\u2019s users were under 13 and revealed sensitive personal information including their email addresses, names and schools. The F.T.C. said the app did not ask for a parent\u2019s permission to collect data on users. When asked by some parents to delete videos and other data, the site refused.Under the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, online services need parents\u2019 permission before collecting personal data of users under 13.\u201cThis record penalty should be a reminder to all online services and websites that target children: We take enforcement of Coppa very seriously, and we will not tolerate companies that flagrantly ignore the law,\u201d said Joseph J. Simons, the agency\u2019s chairman.The agency has come under increasing pressure to strengthen enforcement of children\u2019s online privacy. Last week, more than a dozen children\u2019s advocacy groups called on the F.T.C. to investigate Facebook after reports surfaced that the company had knowingly deceived children into racking up fees from games on its social network.ByteDance, a Chinese internet conglomerate, bought Musical.ly in 2017. The new owner then merged Musical.ly with TikTok, an app it already operated. The app allows users to create short video clips and share them with other users. The Musical.ly version had 65 million users in the United States as of 2014, the F.T.C. said, and the TikTok app remains a big hit today.The investigation was prompted by various news reports and a complaint by the Better Business Bureau. The F.T.C. said that even in a casual review of the app, it found a large portion of the users were under 13 and that it found numerous cases where parents were not notified or asked for permission.User accounts were public by default and adults were able to contact users, regardless of their age. Until 2016, the app allowed users to view other users within a 50-mile radius, the F.T.C. said.When some parents asked to have the data of their children deleted, TikTok deleted a child\u2019s account but retained videos and personal account information about those users on its servers, the agency said.In response to the F.T.C. action, TikTok on Wednesday announced a separate app for people under 13. The new app will not permit the sharing of personal information and puts limits on what content can be posted and shared, the company said.\u201cWhile we\u2019ve always seen TikTok as a place for everyone, we understand the concerns that arise around younger users,\u201d the company said. \u201cIn working with the F.T.C. and in conjunction with today\u2019s agreement, we\u2019ve now implemented changes to accommodate younger U.S. users in a limited, separate app experience that introduces additional safety and privacy protections designed specifically for this audience.\u201d"}, {"title": "Could Elon Musk Talk Himself Into a Tesla Buyout?", "category": "Business", "id": "814ba5b0-e7af-494e-a38a-fe541b522729", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/business/dealbook/elon-musk-tesla-sec.html", "publishdate": 20190227, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/28/business/28db-viewsmusk/merlin_151278633_1f82d376-e3a2-4944-a917-da9f5d76118e-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________Elon Musk might just talk himself into a discounted Tesla buyout.The electric-car maker\u2019s chief executive is in a battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 not for the first time \u2014 over a tweet. At worst, the S.E.C. could force him out of his role at the company.But what then? Tesla\u2019s stock would tumble, putting the company in play \u2014 potentially allowing Mr. Musk to revive the buyout idea that first got him into trouble.Mr. Musk has until March 11 to explain to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan why a social-media post, in which he wrongly suggested Tesla would make 500,000 cars this year, wasn\u2019t a breach of an earlier promise to have his tweets vetted by the company\u2019s lawyers. If she rules against him, the S.E.C. may impose a heavy fine. But at worst, it could force him out.Two things could then happen:\u2022 First, the stock would almost certainly tumble. How much is anyone\u2019s guess, but since Mr. Musk is closely associated with the brand, let\u2019s assume Tesla\u2019s value halves to $26 billion.\u2022 Second, the company might become a takeover target. At a discounted price it would be enticing for carmakers like Toyota or Daimler and for the likes of Apple, Waymo and even Lyft or Uber. Or maybe even Mr. Musk himself.Being ejected from Tesla would leave Mr. Musk free to revive his plan from last summer to take the company private. The infamous tweet in which he said he was \u201cconsidering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured\u201d is what prompted the S.E.C. to accuse him of fraud. And it led to the October court-approved agreement that the regulator on Monday accused him of violating.He has a number of advantages over rival potential bidders, not least his 20 percent ownership stake. The board may be amenable: It\u2019s still packed with his friends, business partners and family. Meanwhile, if his putative backers really were prepared to help buy Tesla at $72 billion \u2014 the valuation implied by his tweet \u2014 they certainly should be at $26 billion.Mr. Musk might even feel inclined to send the S.E.C. a thank-you note.

Last month, a federal judge in Ohio placed Argosy and several other Dream Center campuses under federal receivership, appointing an outside official to handle the chain\u2019s finances. Taken together, those campuses enroll about 10,000 students.Soon after the receivership began, the Education Department began hearing complaints that Argosy had failed to make payments owed to students, according to a letter the agency sent on Wednesday to Dream Center and its receiver.Students often borrow more federal aid money than they need for tuition and have the rest refunded to them by their school to cover living expenses like rent and groceries. But Dream Center improperly withheld some of those so-called credit-balance payments and appears to have used them to cover its own operating expenses, according to court filings by Mark Dottore, Dream Center\u2019s receiver.In its letter, the Education Department called that a \u201csevere breach\u201d of Argosy\u2019s responsibilities to its students. As of early February, payments to students worth at least $10 million were two or more weeks overdue, the agency said.The department said it would no longer send any federal student aid funds to 22 schools operated by Argosy in cities including Chicago, Honolulu, Phoenix, San Francisco and Washington.That decision immediately put the chain\u2019s survival in doubt. Mr. Dottore had warned in legal filings this week that Argosy would not be able to continue without those funds.Mr. Dottore said in a written statement provided by Dream Center that he was disappointed by the Education Department\u2019s actions.\u201cWe are working to determine the best path forward for students at this time,\u201d he said.If Argosy closes, students who are now attending or recently withdrew will be eligible for full refunds on the federal loans they took out to fund their studies, the Education Department said.The revocation does not apply to two other chains that were until recently operated by Dream Center. Those chains, South University and the Arts Institutes International, were spun off from Dream Center last month in an investor-backed effort to preserve some of the struggling chain\u2019s campuses.Dream Center acquired Argosy, South and the Arts Institutes in late 2017 from Education Management Corporation, once one of the country\u2019s largest for-profit operators. Education Management filed for bankruptcy last year, after years of financial and legal problems that included accusations of predatory lending.Dream Center, a Los Angeles-based Christian nonprofit with a focus on social services, worked to convert the for-profit schools it had acquired into nonprofits, which face looser regulation. The agency gave the change preliminary approval, but reversed course on Thursday and denied Argosy\u2019s conversion."}, {"title": "Arbitrator Scolds Fox and Orders It to Pay $178 Million to \u2018Bones\u2019 Team", "category": "Business", "id": "1e936136-d92a-40af-b92b-07ebce41a44c", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/business/media/bones-fox-arbitration-award.html", "publishdate": 20190227, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/28/business/28FOX-01/merlin_76593367_cbfb4f1e-6cd1-49c1-badc-142e03810dec-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "A private arbitrator ruled this month that Fox must pay the extraordinary sum of $178.7 million to former producers and stars of the procedural crime television series \u201cBones\u201d in a dispute over profit participation.The award spotlights a longstanding gripe among even well-compensated Hollywood players over the value of their work, especially as deep-pocketed newcomers like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and Apple come courting. Studios have often been criticized for what some consider questionable accounting practices that cut into back-end payouts.The ruling spilled into public view on Wednesday after the plaintiffs in the case filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award in Los Angeles Superior Court.The arbitrator, Peter D. Lichtman, said that Fox pocketed tens of millions of dollars that should have gone to the \u201cBones\u201d team. He ordered Fox to pay the plaintiffs $50 million in damages and an additional $128 million in punitive damages. Fox is contesting the $128 million ruling.In his 66-page ruling, the arbitrator accused several Fox senior executives \u2014 including the 21st Century Fox president Peter Rice and the Fox Television Group co-chief executive Dana Walden \u2014 of perjuring themselves. Mr. Lichtman said that those executives \u201cappear to have given false testimony in an attempt to conceal their wrongful acts\u201d and accused them of a \u201cpattern of deceit.\u201d\u201cThe arbitrator is convinced that perjury was committed by the Fox witnesses,\u201d Mr. Lichtman wrote.Arbitration hearings are meant to be private and rarely come to light. Fox executives, however, were stunned by the ruling, which they saw as heavily one-sided, according to two people with direct knowledge of their thinking. The opinion left the company little leverage to negotiate a settlement, and the executives decided to contest the damages, the people said. That would also require public scrutiny before a judge.In a statement, 21st Century Fox said, \u201cThe ruling by this private arbitrator is categorically wrong on the merits and exceeded his arbitration powers. Fox will not allow this flagrant injustice, riddled with errors and gratuitous character attacks, to stand and will vigorously challenge the ruling in a court of law.\u201d\u201cBones,\u201d an hourlong crime show, was a sturdy hit for Fox from 2005 to 2017. It starred Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz, both of whom were plaintiffs in the case, along with the executive producer Barry Josephson and the writer Kathy Reichs, who wrote the novels the series was based on.An arbitration hearing requires both sides to agree to the terms of possible damages beforehand. The plaintiffs and defendants also agree in advance to abide by the ruling, without the recourse of an appeal, as in a court trial. But a party can contest an arbitration judgment if it determines that an arbitrator has awarded damages that fall outside the agreed upon terms.Complicating matters is that both Mr. Rice and Ms. Walden are weeks away from moving into senior leadership roles at the Walt Disney Company after it closes on its purchase of the bulk of 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment properties.Fox has been under the leadership of its chairman, Rupert Murdoch, who built his media empire over more than six decades. Last year he agreed to sell the majority of his business to Disney for $71.3 billion. As part of the transaction, Mr. Rice is poised to become the chairman of Walt Disney Television and Ms. Walden will become the chairwoman of Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment.Hours after the ruling become public, Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, defended his incoming senior executives.\u201cPeter Rice and Dana Walden are highly respected leaders in this industry, and we have complete confidence in their character and integrity,\u201d Mr. Iger said in a statement. \u201cDisney had no involvement in the arbitration, and we understand the decision is being challenged and will leave it to the courts to decide the matter.\u201dAt minimum, the producers and the stars of \u201cBones\u201d will be awarded $50 million in damages, but it\u2019s unclear who will be on the hook for that payment. The plaintiffs sued Fox\u2019s television studio, which produced the show; the broadcast network, which aired the show; and 21st Century Fox, the studio and network\u2019s parent company.In the coming weeks, Fox\u2019s television studio will become part of Disney but the broadcast network will remain with Mr. Murdoch as part of a smaller company to be named Fox Corporation. Both Disney and Fox did not offer any explanation for who would be responsible for payment.The extraordinary award for damages has piqued the interest of the creative set in Hollywood. The entertainment industry has undergone a remarkable change with Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, Amazon and Apple cutting big checks for original content. Older fare has also become incredibly valuable. Netflix paid about $100 million to keep \u201cFriends\u201d for at least another year. The show, a decade-long hit for NBC, went off the air in 2004.But as streaming services become more dominant, the economics of entertainment have become more opaque. Producers have struggled to understand how to value their work on a service like Netflix, which rarely offers data on viewership. Hulu, a joint venture whose owners include both Fox and Disney, is buying rights to shows from its own investors. The \u201cBones\u201d arbitrator has suggested Fox was self-dealing when it sold the show\u2019s digital rights to Hulu, potentially depriving the plaintiffs of millions in extra fees.The case is scheduled to move from the shadows of arbitration to a Los Angeles courtroom in late April. The \u201cBones\u201d team will seek to collect its money, while Fox is looking to vacate the $128 million ruling.\u201cWe are so proud of the hard work we did on \u2018Bones\u2019 for 12 seasons and only ever wanted Fox to live up to its promises and contractual obligations,\u201d said Ms. Deschanel. \u201cI am grateful that such a well-respected arbitrator reviewed the facts so thoroughly before ruling the way he did. I look forward to the legal system continuing to hold Fox accountable so that we can all move forward.\u201d"}, {"title": "China Shifts, and Detroit\u2019s Big Bet Goes Sour", "category": "Business", "id": "abd6f37b-25cb-44d1-8ad1-2913b0994651", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/business/china-auto-industry.html", "publishdate": 20190227, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/25/business/00chinacars-1-promo/00chinacars-1-promo-articleLarge-v2.jpg", "content": "ImageA Chevrolet dealership in Chongqing, China.

The country\u2019s growing ranks of drivers bought cars by the millions. Its cheap labor gave American automakers dreams of someday exporting their Chinese-made cars to the United States. The Big Three bet billions of dollars there.Now China\u2019s place in the world is shifting, and that bet is starting to sour.Chinese consumers are buying fewer cars as the country\u2019s economy slows. Local competitors have raised their game. Many young people would rather use ride-sharing services similar to Uber than own vehicles themselves.And if the Trump administration\u2019s trade hawks have their way, China won\u2019t make many cars for Americans. As Washington and Beijing haggle over a deal to end their trade war, the hawks are defending tariffs, imposed by President Trump last year, that would make it expensive to sell Chinese-made cars \u2014 including those with American brands \u2014 in the United States.China\u2019s slowdown presents the most immediate problem. Some of Detroit\u2019s Chinese factories have slowed to a crawl. In the inland metropolis of Chongqing, where Ford builds cars like the compact Focus, three big assembly plants have been running at less than one-fifth of capacity. Ford\u2019s joint venture in Chongqing has quietly begun dismissing thousands of its 20,000 workers.ImageA parking lot in Chongqing where completed Ford models are stored for shipment.

His paychecks had already shrunk by two-thirds because he was working fewer hours. He quit smoking to pay for food and rent, and the family is struggling to pay for the after-school English and math lessons his son needs for a chance at college.\u201cI do not have much education,\u201d Mr. Zhou said. \u201cI had hoped my child would not be like me, the bottom level of labor.\u201dAs China transforms, many global businesses are struggling to adapt.

Initiatives that could juice the economy have slowed. The rest of the world has begun to fundamentally rethink its dependence on China to make much of what the world consumes. Some within the Trump administration see China as an existential threat to core American industries like autos, much as it has come to dominate production of solar panels, steel and aluminum.

His paycheck had already plunged by two-thirds because he was working fewer hours.CreditGilles Sabri\u00e9 for The New York TimesThere have long been doubts among automakers and consumers about whether cars made in China could measure up to those produced in America. But with the gap in quality narrowing, companies in China and the United States have begun to explore the possibility.General Motors, which began exporting the Buick Envision from China to the United States in 2016, has been pleading since last summer without success for the Trump administration to exempt it from a 25 percent tariff imposed on Chinese-made cars. Ford announced in the summer of 2017 that it would move Focus production to China from Michigan, only to cancel those plans as the political landscape changed in the United States. Exports from China to the United States of Detroit-brand cars are \u201ca no-fly zone,\u201d said Michael Dunne, the chief executive of ZoZo Go, an automotive consulting firm in San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s just too politically sensitive.\u201dDetroit\u2019s fortunes in China could still improve. A final trade deal could leave the door open to Chinese exports. The Chinese government could take steps to rev up domestic growth or empower its consumers to buy cars. \u201cA stronger economy will lead to stronger auto sales,\u201d said Irene Shen, a General Motors spokeswoman.But for now, Detroit\u2019s Big Three are struggling in China \u2014 particularly Ford.Business from Detroit has helped China become both the world\u2019s largest maker and its largest buyer of cars. Much of the global auto parts industry has moved there as well, making it especially convenient to manufacture cars in China. Drawn by the country\u2019s rapid development and consumer revolution, G.M. invested about $10 billion. It now makes and sells more cars through its Chinese joint ventures than it does in the United States. Ford, which came later, invested as much as $5 billion. ImageWorkers leaving the Changan Ford factory in Chongqing at the end of a shift.CreditGilles Sabri\u00e9 for The New York TimesChina\u2019s car-building capacity is now roughly equal to those of North America and Europe combined. More car factories are being built to meet regulators\u2019 demands for more electric cars.But a slowing economy and an end to tax breaks for car buyers have brought the industry back to earth. In January, car sales in China fell 18 percent from a year earlier. The average car factory in China, already operating at a little more than half capacity, has slowed even more amid the sales slump, according to LMC Automotive, a consulting firm.American brands are also being squeezed. The Chinese elite still prefer premium German brands like Mercedes, BMW and Audi. More frugal families buy cheaper Chinese and Japanese cars and are increasingly buying used.The ride-hailing business has dealt automakers an unexpected blow. The global auto industry has worried for years that companies like Uber and Lyft could eat into demand, particularly among young customers. That appears to have happened in China, experts say, where dense urban cities have enhanced the appeal of Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hailing giant. Didi now carries twice as many riders in China each year as Uber carries in the rest of the world combined.ImagePassengers on the subway in Chongqing. An extensive subway network and heavy traffic are hindering car sales in this vast inland metropolis.CreditGilles Sabri\u00e9 for The New York Times\u201cNone of the multinational automakers foresaw how disruptive that would be to demand,\u201d said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler\u2019s operations in China.Young people in China are also more open to Chinese brands, thanks in part to their improved quality. \u201cThey\u2019re a lot more favorably disposed towards Chinese brands, and they have a pride in the Chinese brands,\u201d said Nigel Harris, the president of Ford\u2019s main joint venture in China, Changan Ford.This winter has been difficult for American brands in China. Sales of G.M.\u2019s Chevrolet and Buick models have faltered (though Cadillacs continue to sell well), and Chrysler\u2019s Jeeps face stiff competition from cheaper sport utility vehicles made by Chinese companies. After a dismal autumn, Ford sold 70 percent fewer cars in China in January than it did in the same month a year earlier.The automakers are tweaking their lineups to improve sales. G.M. and Ford are ramping up production of their respective Cadillac and Lincoln brands to tap the luxury market. G.M. has expanded its bargain Chinese brands, Baojun and Wuling. In a potentially risky move for its brand, Ford has put its blue oval logo on an inexpensive S.U.V., the Territory, that is mostly designed and built by a Chinese automaker, Jiangling Motors.It is too early to tell how well Ford\u2019s move will go. But at a Ford dealership in Chongqing, the $16,000 Territory was selling briskly, while a number of Focus cars, priced at $22,000, have sat unsold since 2017. \u201cAs soon as one arrives,\u201d Li Pengfei, a salesman, said of the Territory, \u201csomeone picks it up.\u201d Nowhere are the problems of Detroit automakers more apparent than in Chongqing, an often foggy city built on steep slopes overlooking the confluence of two broad, muddy rivers, the Yangtze and the Jialing. When a local hiring hall held an automotive-themed day last week, it was mobbed with former Ford employees who had accepted severance payments and were looking for their next jobs. The company has changed from running factories on up to three shifts, almost around the clock, to just a single shift.ImageApplicants at a job fair in Chongqing spoke with recruiters from a local auto parts manufacturer.CreditGilles Sabri\u00e9 for The New York TimesMr. Harris declined to discuss layoffs in detail, saying, \u201cOrganizational fitness is a critical part of China cost, so we are working night and day to make sure that we are fit.\u201dIn Chongqing, some workers do not see the industry ever recovering.Du Wen, a 28-year-old in a green hoodie and jeans who had assembled car doors for Ford\u2019s joint venture partner, Changan, for the past four years, said that he was going to leave the auto industry entirely. So he was applying to work at a factory making instant soup, even though that would mean a sharp pay cut.\u201cEveryone needs to eat,\u201d he said, \u201ceven when the economy slows down.\u201d"}, {"title": "Biden\u2019s Family Is Urging Him to Run in 2020", "category": "Politics", "id": "bb4d2130-b114-49f3-90b3-771be9dc983f", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/politics/biden-2020-family.html", "publishdate": 20190227, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/27/us/27biden1/27biden1-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "NEWARK, Del. \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said Tuesday that there\u2019s \u201ca consensus\u201d in his family that he should run for president, but Mr. Biden said he did not want to embark on \u201ca fool\u2019s errand\u201d and was still deliberating about whether to enter the race for the Democratic nomination.\u201cThe most important people in my life want me to run,\u201d Mr. Biden said, disclosing that he had a family meeting this month, which included his grandchildren, to discuss whether he should mount what would be his third presidential bid.In the most detailed and unvarnished accounting yet of his thinking, the former vice president outlined a series of concerns about running. They included whether he would be able to garner enough money and support, and the nastiness of the campaign he predicted President Trump would run against whomever Democrats nominate.\u201cIt would be the greatest honor of my life to be president of the United States, but it\u2019s also something I have to make sure I could run a first-rate effort to do this,\u201d he said.It is not clear that Mr. Biden planned to speak, at least at such length, about the possibility of running. He was appearing before about 300 people at the University of Delaware to celebrate the naming of the Joseph R. Biden Jr. School of Public Policy and Administration. And he sat on stage for a conversation with the historian Jon Meacham about Mr. Meacham\u2019s book, \u201cThe Soul of America,\u201d which examines how the country overcame periods of division and turmoil.But after the two spoke for over an hour, only hinting and joking about the question that had drawn a handful of reporters here, Mr. Meacham asked Mr. Biden directly about his intentions. (Mr. Meacham told Mr. Biden before the session that he planned to raise the 2020 question, according to an official familiar with their conversation.) The 76-year-old former vice president \u2014 who has led in early Democratic primary polls \u2014 initially hesitated, praising an audience he said was mostly composed of Delawareans who knew him well. But that only prompted some in the crowd to stir.\u201cCome on, say it!\u201d one woman shouted.Mr. Biden said he was \u201cbeing prodded\u201d by his wife and two children but acknowledged he had been uneasy about \u201ctaking the family through what would be a very, very, very difficult campaign\u201d against Mr. Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s likely to stop at anything, whomever he runs against,\u201d Mr. Biden said.Some of the former vice president\u2019s closest advisers are concerned about how he may react to Mr. Trump\u2019s barbs, particularly if the president invokes the death of Mr. Biden\u2019s son Beau, and the relationship between his other son, Hunter, and Beau\u2019s widow.Yet Mr. Biden made clear that he was just as focused on his prospects in the Democratic race as he was on Mr. Trump. He noted that the rise of social media has dramatically changed campaigns in the decade since he and former President Barack Obama ran, and he said he was taking briefings from \u201cthe most advanced people in the country\u201d about how to run a sophisticated race.And he said he wanted to fund any race on his own terms.\u201cI will not be part of any super PAC,\u201d he said to applause, a posture other Democratic contenders have taken.[Who\u2019s in? Who\u2019s out? Keep up with the 2020 Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]Mr. Biden said he has gotten encouragement from key Democratic donors, as well as \u201csome major Republican folks.\u201dBut he wondered out loud about the \u201calleged appeal that I have,\u201d saying that before he committed to running he wanted to know, \u201cHow deep does it run, is it real?\u201dAt one point he almost seemed to be trying to talk himself into it \u2014 \u201cI think we can,\u201d he said \u2014 before he was met with another plea from the audience. \u201cOh god, just say yes!\u201d a supported yelled.He said he was in \u201cthe final stages\u201d of deciding. And in a brief interview after the event, Mr. Biden said that, if he ran, he would begin his campaign in the second quarter of this year, which could mean as early as April.But Mr. Biden has been creating and blowing past his own self-imposed deadlines for months, and few of the aides who were in attendance dared to hazard a guess as to when he may ultimately decide."}, {"title": "G.M.

But a proposed regulation to require warning signals and other precautions has languished in the face of opposition from the auto industry.Now an effort is underway in Congress to force action on the issue, and at least one automaker has enlisted in the cause.General Motors says it supports a bill introduced this week by Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, that would direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to adopt a rule addressing the danger. It would require automakers to include a feature that automatically shuts off an engine after a specified period of idling. The rule would apply to all new keyless vehicles, which make up more than half of new cars sold in the United States.Because they don\u2019t need to turn a physical key, drivers can forget to shut off a keyless vehicle. Some motorists, particularly older ones, have inadvertently left cars with the engine running in garages attached to homes, which have filled up with carbon monoxide and poisoned occupants, often while they slept.The safety agency proposed a rule in 2011 that would have required automakers to install more beeps and alerts to draw attention to a running vehicle, an effort the industry opposed. Trade groups have said there is not enough data to support the rule. That proposal did not require an automatic shut-off feature.The agency \u201chas abysmally failed in protecting consumers,\u201d said Mr. Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. \u201cThe reason for our legislation is to require the agency within months, not years, to make these devices standard.\u201dGeneral Motors, which has installed an automatic shut-off feature in 31 of 39 keyless models from its Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands, said it \u201csupports the spirit\u201d of the bill, designated the Park It Act. \u201cThis legislation reflects G.M.\u2019s continued dedication to advancing automotive safety,\u201d the company said in a statement. It would not say whether it planned to extend the safety features on its own to its entire fleet.Ford, which has the automatic shut-off function on all its keyless models made after 2015, said it was reviewing the measure and would \u201cwork with the committee as it lays out its legislative agenda on vehicle safety.\u201dImageA sign that Palm Beach County officials in Florida have distributed as a reminder to drivers of keyless vehicles to shut off their engines as a precaution against carbon-monoxide poisoning.CreditScott McIntyre for The New York TimesIn May, The New York Times reported that 28 people had been killed and 45 injured by carbon-monoxide poisoning from keyless vehicles since 2006. At a hearing days later, Senator Blumenthal sharply questioned the agency\u2019s deputy administrator, Heidi King, about the issue and demanded that the agency adopt the rule it proposed in 2011.[Read The Times\u2019 reporting on keyless cars and their carbon monoxide toll.]Since then, five more fatalities have been identified by The Times, including three in December and January.Across manufacturers, there is no consistency in the safeguards to protect motorists against the carbon-monoxide hazard. Some carmakers have gradually introduced an automatic shut-off feature, but others use only sounds or visual alerts to warn motorists of a running engine.Asked if it would follow General Motors in backing the Blumenthal bill, Hyundai also said it was studying the bill. Toyota, Mazda and Volkswagen referred to a statement by an industry group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which said that \u201ccurrent keyless ignition system designs generally follow the recommended practices\u201d of the Society of Automotive Engineers, a car standards body.Toyota vehicles, for example, beep externally three times, and once inside, to inform drivers getting out of a vehicle that the motor is still running, a set of alerts that meets the voluntary standards. Toyota does not have an automatic shut-off feature. Its vehicles, including Lexus models, have figured in almost half of the fatal incidents identified by The Times.Fiat Chrysler, which began introducing an automatic shut-off in its 2018 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivan, did not respond to a request for comment on the Blumenthal bill.The legislation also aims to address the danger of rollaway vehicles, a hazard heightened by keyless ignitions because a driver can leave with the key fob without putting the car into park, regardless of whether the engine is running. The legislation would require carmakers to install technology that prevents a car from moving if the driver\u2019s door is opened, the driver\u2019s seat buckle is unfastened and a brake is not engaged.According to the agency, 142 people were killed by rollaways in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available. It is not clear how many of the vehicles were keyless.In January, the highway safety agency said that it continued to review public comments on its 2011 proposal, and that it was \u201cevaluating a range of options to determine the best path forward to optimize safety.\u201d It also pointed to a safety video it released in 2016 to highlight the carbon-monoxide and rollaway hazards of keyless vehicles."}, {"title": "Trump Trade Adviser Defends China Deal Before Congressional Skeptics", "category": "Business", "id": "ba1316f4-e918-4b67-9ca1-314ac01bcf38", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/us/politics/robert-lighthizer-china-trade.html", "publishdate": 20190227, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/28/business/28DC-TRADE/28DC-TRADE-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Robert Lighthizer, the president\u2019s top trade adviser, cautioned lawmakers on Wednesday that hurdles remain to reaching a significant trade deal with China but said the administration\u2019s talks represent the best hope for resetting economic terms between the two nations.Mr. Lighthizer, in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, confirmed that the United States would formally abandon its plan to raise tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports. President Trump said over the weekend that he would delay the higher tariffs, which were expected to kick in on Saturday, citing \u201csignificant progress\u201d in talks with Beijing.But Mr. Lighthizer struck a more circumspect tone than Mr. Trump, who in recent days has predicted a \u201cvery, very good chance\u201d of striking a deal with China and turned his attention toward a signing ceremony, potentially next month, at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, with President Xi Jinping of China.\u201cIf all works well, we\u2019re going to have some very big news over the next week or two,\u201d Mr. Trump said Sunday evening.Mr. Lighthizer told lawmakers that he and his negotiators are maintaining a tough line with the Chinese, repeatedly using the word \u201cif\u201d when talking about the potential for reaching a deal with Beijing. If an agreement can be reached, he said, it would include concrete commitments to make structural economic reforms, like curtailing state subsidies, ending the forced transfer of intellectual property and opening up markets to foreign competitors.The Chinese have so far resisted making big concessions in those areas, people familiar with the negotiations say, prompting concern from business leaders, trade groups and some members of the Trump administration that the president might accept a weaker deal to end the monthslong trade war and declare victory on the 2020 campaign trail.In candid testimony, the trade representative said he was not sure that his get-tough approach would work but said it was better than the alternative.\u201cI honestly believe that good people tried for 20 years the multilateral approach, the talk approach and the \u2018let\u2019s all go along get along\u2019 approach,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said, as he hoisted a piece of paper featuring a chart showing the steadily increasing trade deficit in goods between the United States and China. \u201cThey just demonstrably failed.\u201d\u201cIs this perfect? I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s perfect,\u201d he said of the evolving deal. \u201cBut at least it\u2019s leading to results where everything else didn\u2019t.\u201dMr. Lighthizer said the Chinese want the United States to lift tariffs it has imposed on $250 billion worth of goods, but he made no promises that would happen without a tough deal.The trade adviser also played down the idea that Mr. Trump is growing impatient and wants to strike an agreement. He said the president wants a deal, but only if it resolves the big concerns that prompted the United States to start a trade war. \u201cHis instructions to me are: You have to get a great agreement. If we have no agreement, we\u2019ll just wait until we can get a great agreement,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said.But he acknowledged the difficulty of ensuring that China would adhere to any agreement in the coming years, calling that \u201ca challenge that goes on for a long, long time.\u201dMr. Lighthizer described a complex enforcement mechanism the two nations are discussing to ensure that China would not renege on its commitments. Under the evolving pact, the Chinese have agreed to periodic meetings at the levels of office director, vice minister and minister that would allow the United States to keep tabs on China\u2019s behavior and air complaints from companies about unfair business practices. If China fails to keep its agreement, the United States would respond \u201cproportionally but unilaterally,\u201d he said.Politicians of both parties, academics and the business community have gradually formed a consensus in recent years that China has failed to keep the commitments it made when joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, and that practices like subsidizing its own companies and blocking foreign competitors from its market have unfairly damaged American industries and workers.But those critics have been divided over the president\u2019s choice of tariffs as his favored weapon. In a report released by the American Chamber of Commerce in China this week, companies reported declining optimism about their ability to operate in China and cited \u201cbilateral tensions\u201d as a top challenge.On Wednesday, both Democrats and Republicans shared concerns about the damaging effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs and China\u2019s retaliatory levies on products made and purchased in their districts, including cribs, robot vacuums, soybeans, Hollywood films and rice.Mr. Lighthizer admitted that tariffs were \u201ca blunt instrument\u201d but said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any other.\u201dMr. Trump has wielded tariffs in nearly every trade dispute, imposing steel and aluminum levies on America\u2019s biggest trading partners and threatening tariffs on imports of cars and car parts. Lawmakers and business groups are growing concerned that the administration lacks an exit plan for the tariffs, even once the United States reaches trade agreements with other nations.Both Republicans and Democrats have complained about the administration\u2019s failure to remove metal tariffs on Canada and Mexico, despite reaching a new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. A growing number of lawmakers have warned that they will not ratify the new trade deal, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement, if Mr. Trump does not remove the tariffs.Mr. Lighthizer, who negotiated the new North American trade deal, tried to assure lawmakers that the administration was working to minimize the tariffs, saying he was trying to reach an agreement with Canada and Mexico to limit their exports of steel and aluminum into the United States. Mr. Trump labeled global metal imports a threat to national security last year and imposed tariffs to stem their flow.Other members of the administration have also indicated that the issue will soon be addressed.\u201cI think what we\u2019re moving toward is a resolution over the tariffs, possibly to be replaced by reasonable quotas with which Canada and Mexico can live, and have the retaliatory tariffs removed,\u201d Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said at a congressional hearing on Wednesday.Earlier this month, Mr. Perdue said he told Mr. Trump and Mr. Lighthizer that he believed the steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico should be removed."}, {"title": "Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Review: A $1,000 Smartphone With Compromises", "category": "Business", "id": "e2d97806-2fca-4ccd-a0b3-62f2c7ea03b1", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/technology/personaltech/samsung-galaxy-s10-review.html", "publishdate": 20190227, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/28/business/28techfix1/28techfix1-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "After I set up Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy S10 Plus phone last week, I showed it to my partner and said with atypical enthusiasm, \u201cCheck it out \u2014 this phone has the fingerprint sensor built directly into the screen.\u201dI pressed my thumb down on the screen, where the fingerprint sensor was embedded. \u201cNo match,\u201d a message on the phone read. I pressed down again and got the same message. After five failed attempts, it asked for a passcode.\u201cGreat demo,\u201d my partner said as she turned back to browsing Instagram on her phone.A few days later, Samsung issued a software update that it described as a security patch for biometrics. After I installed it and re-enrolled my fingerprints, the Galaxy\u2019s reader showed a marked improvement. The phone registered my print to unlock the phone the majority of the time, though there were still occasional failures.My bumpy experience with the print sensor firmed up one conclusion: Face recognition is a more convenient method for unlocking phones, and Samsung is behind Apple in this area. That is unfortunate in an era of skyrocketing phone prices: If you\u2019re shelling out this much cash for a phone, you expect to get the best of the best, not a compromise. The Galaxy S10 Plus is no modest gadget, with a starting price of $1,000. And Samsung is preparing to push prices up even higher with the Galaxy Fold, a highly anticipated $1,980 tablet that physically folds into a pocketable cellphone, which will become available in late April. Apple phased out fingerprint sensors in its newest iPhones after fully embracing its face-scanning technology, which works by spraying your face with infrared dots to create a 3-D image. That image is then used to check whether you are the smartphone\u2019s owner before unlocking the device. Face recognition has proved to be more difficult for thieves to manipulate; it also logs you into your phone more consistently than a fingerprint sensor. Samsung\u2019s phones also have face scanners, but they use a less secure method for authenticating you. More on this later.ImageThe Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.CreditSamsungDespite the hiccups, I enjoyed using Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 Plus, its new flagship device, which will become available on March 8. The device was an upgrade from Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S9 phones, which were also excellent Android devices. Notable new features include a 6.4-inch high-definition screen, an ultra wide-angle lens for taking broader shots, the ability to use the phone to wirelessly charge another device\u2019s battery and an improved battery that made the phone last all day.After I used the Galaxy S10 Plus for a week, here\u2019s what I found.Impressive wide-angle shotsI began my tests by taking the Galaxy S10 Plus outdoors to try the new  camera. The back of the device has a triple-lens system, meaning it has one more lens than some of last year\u2019s Galaxy phones that had dual-lens cameras. The new camera has a so-called ultra wide-angle lens for taking shots with a wider field of view than traditional phone cameras, which makes it handy for shooting landscapes or large group gatherings. To take an ultra wide-angle shot, you pinch inward to zoom all the way out.ImageA photo taken at Ocean Beach in San Francisco using the new ultra wide-angle lens on Samsung's Galaxy S10 Plus.CreditBrian X. Chen for The New York TimesThe results were impressive. One shot on a beach was so encompassing that it captured people standing on the sand, the ocean waves and the adjacent parking lot.ImageThe ultra wide-angle lens on Samsung's Galaxy S10 Plus is well suited for landscape photography.CreditBrian X. Chen for The New York TimesAnother ultrawide shot showed my dogs running alongside a pond and the surrounding trees, blue sky and grass fields. The details of the ripples in the lake and the clouds in the sky looked stunning.Initially, I was skeptical about needing yet another camera lens on a smartphone, but ultrawide photography was delightful. I look forward to this feature coming to other phones this year.An excellent screen and a robust batteryThe new Samsung device\u2019s 6.4-inch screen is on a par with the 6.5-inch screen on Apple\u2019s iPhone XS Max and the 6.3-inch display on Google\u2019s Pixel 3 XL. All produce sharp, rich images with accurate colors and excellent shadow detail. (If you asked me which screen was best, I would call it a draw.)As for the battery, the Galaxy S10 Plus had such long battery life that by bedtime after a busy day, the device still had about 25 percent of juice remaining. Samsung said it expanded the size of the battery while also improving the software to manage energy use.Samsung is so confident in the new Galaxy phone\u2019s battery that it designed the device to wirelessly charge other gadgets, like smart watches and other phones. The feature, Wireless PowerShare, uses induction, which involves tapping an electrical current to generate a magnetic field that powers other devices.To use the power-sharing feature, you hit a button in the phone\u2019s settings and place another device that supports wireless charging onto the back of the Samsung. I stacked my iPhone and the Galaxy S10 Plus back to back, and it took the Samsung about 15 minutes to replenish 5 percent of the iPhone\u2019s battery. That\u2019s a slow charge rate, though Samsung said the feature was primarily intended for charging accessories like wireless earbuds or smart watches.An improved fingerprint sensor, but weaker biometrics than the iPhoneI found that the fingerprint reader on Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 Plus was an improvement over past models. But the device\u2019s biometrics over all were still weaker than the features on Apple\u2019s iPhone, Samsung\u2019s biggest rival.In previous Samsung phones, the sensor was a physical button on the back of the phone near the camera, which often led people to accidentally bump the camera lenses when attempting to unlock their phones.Now the sensor is on the front and embedded in the screen. Its ultrasonic technology uses sound waves that read the ridges and valleys of a finger. This means you can now unlock the phone while it is flat on a table, and the ultrasonic technology will be able to scan your print through water or grease. In addition, because the captured image is so detailed, the print becomes much more difficult to spoof than with past fingerprint sensors.In my tests, I was able to unlock the phone while my hand was damp.On the downside, Samsung is behind Apple in face recognition. While Apple uses infrared scanning to create a precise 3-D map of a person\u2019s face, Samsung\u2019s face scanner uses the camera to take your photo and then compares it with an image stored on the device. So a thief could fool the system by holding a photo of your face in front of the camera.Because a person\u2019s head shape is unique, the likelihood of bypassing infrared-based facial recognition with an incorrect face is one in a million, according to Qualcomm. In contrast, the false-acceptance rate of older face-scanning techniques like Samsung\u2019s is one in 100, and the false-acceptance rate of fingerprint scanning (including the new ultrasonic technology) is one in 50,000.ImageInside Samsung's phone settings, a disclaimer on the face-scanning feature warns users that the security is weaker than other unlocking methods.CreditBrian X. Chen for The New York TimesNonetheless, I tried Samsung\u2019s face recognition feature. When you set it up, Samsung shows a warning that face recognition is less secure because someone who looks like you or uses an image of you could unlock the phone. After taking a photo of my face, the feature was quick to detect my mug and unlock the phone, but it did not instill me with much confidence.I shared my concerns with Samsung. Drew Blackard, a director of product marketing at the company, said that based on customer feedback, the fingerprint sensor was the most popular method for unlocking devices. As a result, the company focused on improving that feature.He added that Samsung was studying face recognition and had made it more difficult to trick the scanner with a photo of a person\u2019s face. \u201cIs it an area that we\u2019re continuing to look at? The answer is: Of course,\u201d Mr. Blackard said. I have to say Samsung\u2019s decision to focus on fingerprint sensing instead of upgrading its face scanner is not particularly satisfying. User feedback isn\u2019t generally an ideal way to design security features. After all, many people also enjoy using the same weak passwords across all their internet accounts.It also bodes ill for other Samsung phones, such as the Galaxy Fold, which is among the most anticipated handsets of the year. If tomorrow\u2019s smartphone folds up like a book but lacks some of today\u2019s best security features, it would certainly give me pause.Related Coverage A Review of the Samsung Galaxy S9, in EmojiMarch 8, 2018Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note9: Too Much Phone for Most of UsAug. 22, 2018The Google Pixel 3 Review: Phone\u2019s Smarts Shine Through Its A.I.-Driven CameraOct. 15, 2018The iPhone XS and XS Max Review: Big Screens That Are a Delight to UseSept. 18, 2018The Smartphone\u2019s Future: It\u2019s All About the CameraAug. 30, 2017"}, {"title": "DealBook Briefing: Cohen Trashes Trump\u2019s Business Image", "category": "Business", "id": "dccb9dcc-2426-4fd7-86a5-e995ed20856a", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/business/dealbook/cohen-trump-business.html", "publishdate": 20190228, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/01/business/01db-newsletter-cohen/merlin_151361829_07bd016b-884d-4130-b5db-961dab2ee37a-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Good Thursday.

But between allegations of presidential lawbreaking and racism were revelations about how the Trump Organization operated. They weren\u2019t flattering.Mr. Trump inflated his net worth to apply for bank loans, according to Mr. Cohen. When he asked Deutsche Bank for financing to buy the Buffalo Bills, he claimed to have $4 billion in unquantified \u201cbrand value.\u201d He also exaggerated the value of properties, according to financial statements that Mr. Cohen gave to the House.Democratic lawmakers pushed Mr. Cohen to talk about other kinds of fraud. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, asked him whether Mr. Trump inflated the value of assets when insuring them. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied.The testimony may have hurt Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle. Potential victims: Donald Trump Jr. and Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization\u2019s C.F.O., both of whom were said to have played a role in hush-money payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels; Ivanka Trump, who was involved in plans to build a tower in Moscow; and Jay Sekulow, a White House lawyer whom Mr. Cohen accused of altering testimony to Congress.Mr. Cohen hinted that more could be revealed. He told lawmakers that he couldn\u2019t answer questions about his last conversation with the president because it was \u201cbeing investigated right now\u201d by federal prosecutors.Mr. Trump\u2019s woes certainly aren\u2019t over. Five House committees are investigating his business dealings, and federal prosecutors in New York are still looking at matters that involved Mr. Cohen.The China trade deal won\u2019t be perfectRobert Lighthizer, the president\u2019s top trade adviser, warned lawmakers yesterday that hurdles remained to reaching a significant trade deal with China, Ana Swanson of the NYT reports:Plans to raise tariffs on Chinese goods are officially axed. Mr. Lighthizer, testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee, confirmed that the U.S. wouldn\u2019t raise levies on $200 billion in Chinese imports after March 1.Mr. Lighthizer still plans to play hardball. He \u201ctold lawmakers that he and his negotiators are maintaining a tough line with the Chinese,\u201d Ms. Swanson writes, \u201crepeatedly using the word \u2018if\u2019 when talking about the potential for reaching a deal with Beijing.\u201dAnd he insists that President Trump isn\u2019t losing patience. \u201cHis instructions to me are: You have to get a great agreement. If we have no agreement, we\u2019ll just wait until we can get a great agreement,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said.But success isn\u2019t guaranteed. \u201cIs this perfect? I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s perfect,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said of the evolving deal. \u201cBut at least it\u2019s leading to results where everything else didn\u2019t.\u201dMore: The U.S. trade deficit in goods widened by 10 percent in December, despite the administration\u2019s attempts to shrink it.ImageQualcomm\u2019s stand at the Mobile World Congress.CreditPau Barrena/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty ImagesCan America win the 5G race?The main topic at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, this week has been the long-hyped next generation of wireless networks, known as 5G, Adam Satariano of the NYT writes.The F.C.C.\u2019s chairman says America is winning the race. \u201cIn my view we\u2019re in the lead with respect to 5G,\u201d the chairman, Ajit Pai, told the WSJ. He believes the agency is making progress in selling the necessary wireless spectrum and overhauling infrastructure.Not everyone agrees. Brent Skorup, who sits on the F.C.C.\u2019s Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee, writes in a WSJ op-ed that \u201cthe U.S. has stumbled,\u201d but \u201cstill has time to catch and pass China, the current leader \u2014 if the right policies are put in place on both the local and federal levels.\u201d\u201cA widely available, reliable 5G network will require hundreds of thousands of new transmitter sites, and on that score the U.S. trails badly,\u201d Mr. Skorup writes. Private industry will need to collaborate with the federal government, he cautions, adding that \u201cwith a combination of responsible use of public assets and light-touch regulation of 5G services, we can still win this race.\u201dMore: Here are all the 5G handsets announced so far.No deal for the U.S. and North KoreaToday was supposed to bring a denuclearization deal between America and North Korea. Instead, officials abruptly cut short a summit meeting between President Trump and North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. \u201cSometimes you have to walk,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference today.Blame sanctions. Mr. Trump told reporters that North Korea wanted all of the punishing economic sanctions against the country lifted, but America wouldn\u2019t cooperate unless Mr. Kim agreed to give up all of his nuclear weapons.The announcement was a surprise, in part because Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim appeared to be getting along well. At one point, Mr. Trump called his counterpart \u201cmy friend.\u201dThe collapse of the talks was \u201ca diplomatic failure after he had hoped his second summit with Kim, following their meeting last summer in Singapore, would produce demonstrable progress toward North Korea\u2019s denuclearization,\u201d the WaPo reports. Mr. Trump insisted that the two countries could resume talks in the future.Theresa May\u2019s unlikely Brexit bouncebackA week ago, the British prime minister was on the brink of resignations by cabinet officials and a crushing defeat in Parliament over her Brexit plan. Now, she has won another two weeks to tweak her agreement and convince lawmakers to back it.Mrs. May won a set of votes last night that had previously threatened to undermine her control of the Brexit process. The victory followed a partial surrender: She agreed on Tuesday to give Parliament the option of seeking to delay Britain\u2019s exit from the E.U.\u201cTheresa May is closer to leading Britain out of the European Union with a Brexit deal than at any other point since her negotiations with Brussels began,\u201d Therese Raphael of Bloomberg Opinion writes. Hard-line Euroskeptic M.P.s like Jacob Rees-Mogg have softened their opposition to Mrs. May\u2019s plans, fearing that the alternative might be remaining in the E.U.But her offer of a potential delay could fall apart. President Emmanuel Macron said France might veto such a move \u201cwithout a clear understanding of the aim that\u2019s being pursued.\u201dMore: Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party formally backed a new referendum on Brexit. Britain won approval to remain in a key World Trade Organization agreement. And Norway\u2019s $1 trillion wealth fund said it would continue to invest in Britain, on the basis that its 30-year time horizon wasn\u2019t affected by political issues like Brexit.ImageCreditKeith Srakocic/Associated PressUpset by a lower tax refund? Don\u2019t beNews stories about Americans outraged by smaller tax refunds are everywhere. But Neil Irwin of the Upshot says the furor isn\u2019t rooted in logic.\u2022 \u201cThe tax law that President Trump signed at the end of 2017 reduced the average American household\u2019s 2018 average federal income tax obligation by about $1,600, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center.\u201d\u2022 But it meant that many workers prepaid less tax. The average tax refund filed through mid-February was down 17 percent from the same time last year, according to the I.R.S.\u2022 A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow, Mr. Irwin notes \u2014 which means a lower initial bill is worth more than a bigger refund.\u2022 Economists remain baffled by the phenomenon of people even wanting refunds. \u201cWhy do they want to make interest-free loans to the government?\u201d asks Richard Thaler, the Nobel-winning economist.Have we hit peak car?Car ownership is falling out of fashion \u2014 under pressure from rising prices, tightening environmental rules, ride-hailing competition and the promise of a self-driving future. In its latest cover story, Bloomberg Businessweek argues that trend could continue:\u2022 \u201cA decade ago the auto industry predicted annual global vehicle sales would top 100 million by now, but they\u2019ve stalled instead, falling to 94.2 million last year, down 1 million from 2017.\u201d\u2022 \u201cMajor urban centers such as London, Madrid, and Mexico City are restricting cars\u2019 access. Such constraints, plus the expansion of the sharing economy and the advent of the autonomous age, have made automakers nervous.\u201d\u2022 \u201c \u2018When you put all these trends together, you\u2019re going to see a cap on personal vehicle ownership start to emerge,\u2019 says Mike Ramsey, an automotive consultant with researcher Gartner Inc. \u2018We are near peak car.\u2019 \u201d\u2022 \u201cRather than signaling the end of the road for the automobile, peak car is a reflection that reurbanization and the widespread adoption of mobile apps that can summon a vehicle on demand will lessen the need for many of the 1.3 billion vehicles now on the road.\u201d\u2022 \u201cAutomakers may talk a good game about moving metal, but increasingly they\u2019re chasing profits expected to come from services that charge by the mile.\u201dToo few women get legal workplace equalityA new World Bank report examined 35 indicators of legal equality in 187 countries to understand how easy it is for women to work and earn money.It rates only six countries as giving women full legal equality: Belgium, Denmark, France, Latvia, Luxembourg and Sweden. By its measures, none did so a decade ago. America isn\u2019t even in its top 60 countries for legal environments that help promote gender parity in the workplace.That\u2019s a problem. \u201cEconomies that failed to implement reforms toward gender equality over the past 10 years, for example, saw a smaller increase in the percentage of women working overall and in the percentage of women working relative to men,\u201d Kristalina Georgieva, the World Bank Group\u2019s interim president, writes.\u201cIf women have equal opportunities to reach their full potential, the world would not only be fairer, it would be more prosperous as well,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cChange is happening, but not fast enough.\u201dMore: How income inequality can affect mental health.Revolving doorCBS reportedly plans to choose its next chief executive by the end of March, with the interim C.E.O., Joseph Ianniello, and Hasbro\u2019s chief, Brian Goldner, seen as front-runners.The law firm Freshfields hired Aimen Mir, a former Treasury Department official who oversaw the American panel responsible for national security reviews of transactions, as a partner.The speed readDealsOne of Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s biggest shareholders, Wellington Management, opposes its $74 billion bid for Celgene.

That is more than what was announced in all of 2018, 2017 or 2016, and it accounts for 40 percent of all takeover announcements in the United States so far.Major drug makers are in a race to find their next blockbuster. As the complexity of drugs has increased, though, so has the cost to develop them. That has made buying a biotech company with a promising candidate an increasingly popular way in recent years for the largest pharmaceutical companies to replenish their drug pipeline.Competition for the takeover targets, however, has also meant big pharma companies are having to pay high prices. That is being reflected in the premiums being offered in the deals this year. The high premiums are also a result of the battering that biotech stocks took during the market\u2019s downturn in late 2018.When it acquired Celgene, a cancer-focused biotech, for $81 billion in the largest deal of the year, Bristol-Myers Squibb paid 52 percent more than Celgene\u2019s stock price over the prior month. Eli Lilly paid Loxo Oncology\u2019s shareholders a 74 percent premium this year, and Roche agreed this week to pay a 164 percent premium for a gene therapy company, Spark Therapeutics.On average, acquirers are paying 120 percent above where the target biotech and pharmaceutical company\u2019s shares had traded over the previous 30 days, the largest average premium in at least two decades, according to Dealogic.Many had predicted the wave of consolidation in the biotech industry last year: Uncertainty around drug pricing policy and the fate of the Affordable Care Act had eased, and major drugmakers were armed with a cash windfall from the tax cut. Yet after a strong first half of the year, a weakening global economy and tumult in the markets quickly dampened deal-making.That stock market decline late last year also left many potential targets cheaper, and more attractive, takeover candidates. From its 2018 high in late August to its low on Dec. 24, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index tumbled 27 percent, compared with a 13 percent decline over that period for health care companies in the S&P 500 as a whole.That slide has helped make the premiums being paid for biotech companies this year look eye-popping, which has unnerved shareholders of some of the buyers. But when taken from where the target\u2019s shares traded before the market downturn at the end of last year, the premiums look more reasonable.Bristol-Myers\u2019s offer for Celgene, for example, came to $102.43 a share on the day it was announced. That was below where Celgene\u2019s stock traded at the start of 2018.In the cases of Loxo and Spark, the prices offered were just 23 percent above the highs the two companies\u2019 stock had hit in the past year. That\u2019s roughly in line with the average premium paid in all deals last year."}, {"title": "Dents Begin to Show at Top End of Classic Car Market", "category": "Business", "id": "0ebc91f0-fa42-4049-b15a-4c2a157832a2", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/business/dents-begin-to-show-at-top-end-of-classic-car-market.html", "publishdate": 20190228, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/01/business/01wheels-classic-print/merlin_150362583_d605b145-e26f-47c2-8b1c-94db367690e9-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Five years ago, the classic car market had just completed a turnaround that left even seasoned observers surprised by its speed. The deep recession that began in 2007 had dealt the same initial blow to vintage car prices that it did to the Dow and to the real estate market.The downturn erased four or five years\u2019 worth of gains for collectible cars, by many estimates. But by 2014, most had fully recouped their pre-recession values, and the market has maintained an even keel.There are some signs, however, that the good times may be coming to an end. A mix of factors is at play, including demographics, changes to tax laws and general uncertainty.For auctions in 2018 and early 2019, the sell-through rate (the percentage of cars meeting reserve and selling) for million-dollar-plus cars has dropped about 20 percent from the previous year, according to Hagerty, a classic-car insurer in Michigan. That\u2019s the lowest rate since Hagerty started tracking the statistic in 2008.The wealthiest and most discriminating collectors may simply be taking a pass on the current offerings, or \u201cit may be a sign that the savviest collectors are sensing a change in the tone of the market,\u201d said Brian Rabold, vice president for valuation at Hagerty.If the recent crop of cars isn\u2019t persuading elite collectors to raise their paddles, the question then becomes why aren\u2019t more owners of blue-chip cars selling them?Cam Ingram, a collector and restorer in North Carolina, pointed to last year\u2019s changes in Section 1031 of the tax code, which had allowed the capital gains tax on a sale to be deferred if the proceeds were used to buy another collectible \u2014 artwork, say, or cars.\u201cOne factor that few people are acknowledging at the moment is the effect of the loss of 1031 exchanges,\u201d Mr. Ingram said. \u201cTop collectors were able to strategically play with positions in their collections to avoid realizing taxes on gains. Now they have to be far more disciplined. The change in the law is affecting both supply and demand.\u201dWith the economy still running strong, he added, few top collectors are in a position where they need to sell to free up cash.Both Mr. Ingram and Michael Sheehan, a dealer-broker of vintage Ferraris in Southern California, acknowledged the perception among top collectors that now might be the time to hold the best of the best. When those cars do sell, they often do so off the radar and at still very robust prices, they said. Private sales have always taken place among elite collectors, but now comparatively few big private sales are the exception to the general rule that the top of the market is cooling off.Demographics, too, are influencing this market.\u201cEvery day, I get the same calls: Guy dies, his kids don\u2019t want the cars, and they want me to sell them. Or it\u2019s knee surgery, hip surgery or prostate cancer and the owner simply can\u2019t enjoy the car anymore,\u201d Mr. Sheehan said.What Mr. Sheehan describes is most likely the vanguard of a wave of baby boomers getting out of the market, and nobody seems to have a clear idea of what comes next.When the classic-car market rebounded after the recession, it was still boomer-driven, and the very top end came back first, in 2011, according to Hagerty data.\u201cThe stock market was still in a slump, and cars were being talked about as one of the few asset classes where good returns could be had,\u201d Mr. Ingram said. \u201cBy the next year, the middle of the market (cars costing between $250,000 and $1 million) returned to health, and the year after that, the entry level got active again.\u201dIf there is a shift now, it\u2019s still in its early days, and the market may be mirroring its resurgence from 2011 to 2013. The broad entry level continues to be robust, according to Mr. Ingram and Mr. Rabold, while the top end is sluggish, a possible leading indicator of a general slump.The United States economy is in its longest period of growth on record, and most observers predict a downturn reasonably soon. That would certainly affect the classic-car market. But it\u2019s the demographic shift, combined with the potential for another 2008-like crash, that seems to worry the keenest market-watchers the most.\u201cSeveral things are in play here,\u201d Mr. Sheehan said. \u201cThere\u2019s general uncertainty and concern about things like the world economy and Brexit. The boomers are leaving the market in droves.\u201cYounger people can\u2019t drive a stick shift,\u201d he added, \u201cand they can\u2019t afford the cars at the level that the boomers have driven the prices to \u2014 they\u2019re busy paying record money for housing, education debt and health care.\u201dAt the moment, the market seems to be in a holding pattern.\u201cGen-Xers and millennials are still priced out of the market,\u201d Mr. Sheehan said. \u201cThe last time that the market corrected, in 2008, it turned around quickly after it became apparent that the recession wouldn\u2019t turn into a depression. Baby boomer money was still in play, and it quickly drove prices back to pre-correction levels.\u201dThat may not happen again. \u201cThe boomers aren\u2019t going to be around to prop the market back up after the next one,\u201d Mr. Sheehan said.What it all means is debatable. Mr. Ingram and Mr. Sheehan both believe that some form of correction is inevitable as baby boomers complete their exit from the market over the next 10 to 15 years. Their cars aren\u2019t going to disappear, but their ability to spend will.\u201cHow Gen-Xers and millennials will value those cars,\u201d Mr. Ingram said, \u201cis the $64,000 question.\u201d"}, {"title": "Decision for 2020 Democrats: Should They Get in the Race Early, or Really Early?", "category": "Politics", "id": "4485788f-e558-4cd9-a24d-4dd0a789bc4b", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/us/politics/2020-democrats-announcements.html", "publishdate": 20190228, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/03/us/politics/03latecomers-1-print/merlin_150562107_d619d73a-e5a5-4341-a635-8a9729ddd05d-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "The country is 337 days away from the Iowa caucuses and 611 days from the general election for president.

A winter launch means more time to raise money, attract coveted staff members and build grass-roots support.

If he were to run, he said, he expected he would enter the race in the second quarter of the year.Mr. O\u2019Rourke, whose strong showing in his failed challenge to Senator Ted Cruz boosted him to political stardom, has kept his decision-making process far more closely held.While Mr. O\u2019Rourke has spent his time since his Senate defeat traveling the country, posting viral Instagram videos and talking to voters, others\u2019 presidential aspirations have been complicated by their day jobs. Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, another potential candidate, is reluctant to spend much time traveling to early primary states during his state\u2019s legislative session, a gathering that happens only once every two years and isn\u2019t expected to finish until April, his aides say.ImagePolls show that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would be an early front runner if he entered the race.CreditTim Tai/The Philadelphia Inquirer, via Associated PressMr. Hickenlooper was governor until early January, making it difficult for him to fully focus on a presidential campaign until after the new year, aides said. He has argued taking the extra time is worth the potential cost.\u201cTo me, it\u2019s better to be late a few weeks and lose money on it, and not have raised as much money as you would have, but actually have everybody unified,\u201d Mr. Hickenlooper told Colorado reporters, who traveled to Iowa to cover his not-quite-yet-campaign.Of course, in 2020, \u201clate\u201d is still really early. Democratic candidates have packed the field far faster in 2019 than in any other primary contest in the modern era.[Just how early are candidates joining the race? We looked at every primary since 1972.]For those outside the race, the whole discussion over whether to announce in January or April seems slightly insane.\u201cThe primaries are in a few weeks, right?\u201d joked Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who has endorsed Ms. Harris. \u201cThe whole thing, it\u2019s absurd. \u2018Biden really needs to decide right now.\u2019 Really, does he? I mean come on.\u201dBut whether Mr. Biden is out or in, Democrats haven\u2019t seen a race this wide open in over a decade. Competition for donors and staff is fierce, with some early-state operatives being courted by nearly a dozen candidates, candidates-to-be and potential candidates.Already, fund-raising requests flood Democrats\u2019 inboxes, a reflection of the frenzy around small-dollar donations that has taken hold as candidates try to court the party\u2019s base by rejecting corporate and big-dollar donations \u2014 at least for the primary contest.ImageFormer Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado has argued that taking longer to decide on a presidential run is worth the cost.CreditCharlie Neibergall/Associated PressThe earlier candidates enter the race, the more time they have to build up their political ATMs \u2014 a roster of potential supporters they can tap again and again for contributions. They will be competing with grass-roots fund-raising behemoths, some of whom have millions left over from past campaigns and expansive lists of supporters. Mr. Sanders, for instance, collected over $10 million in his first week as a candidate, according to campaign officials.Much of the fund-raising anxiety stems from the looming deadline of April 15, the date candidates must file their first financial reports of the year with the Federal Election Commission. With early polling measuring little more than name recognition, those numbers are typically viewed as the first real demonstration of relative strength.\u201cI would not wait much longer,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, the president of the political action committee Emily\u2019s List and an early proponent of online fund-raising as Howard Dean\u2019s national finance director. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to run they\u2019ve got to go. The money isn\u2019t just going to come immediately.\u201dSupporters of Ms. Warren, who effectively pushed up the start date of the race with her surprise New Year\u2019s Eve announcement, say her early entrance allowed unfettered political space for her message. But she has still faced fund-raising struggles, as Mr. Sanders \u2014 who poses perhaps her toughest competition for economic progressives \u2014 has raised far more money.\u201cBeing first in has one downside: People can applaud your big bold ideas while also thinking, \u2018I\u2019d like to wait six months before picking a horse and making my first donation,\u2019\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the liberal Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Ms. Warren.Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary and former mayor of San Antonio, who launched his exploratory committee more than two weeks before Ms. Warren, described his early start as a strategic choice to give himself the best shot at building a following against better-known and better-financed rivals.\u201cWhat I need is time. I need the fight to start earlier,\u201d Mr. Castro said.But some Democrats question whether the traditional rules of the so-called \u201cinvisible primary\u201d \u2014 the pre-voting period when candidates rack up endorsements, donors and media attention \u2014 still apply. In 2015, President Trump entered the primaries in June, and Mr. Sanders at the end of April.Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who is working for Mr. Hickenlooper, says the real sorting of the field will begin with the first primary debate in June, a potentially two-night event that she believes will have \u201coff-the-chart\u201d viewership.\u201cI just think all these traditional trappings of primary campaigns were upended in 2016 and are already being upended in 2020,\u201d Ms. Greenberg said. \u201cNobody really knows what the rules are now.\u201d"}, {"title": "HBO\u2019s C.E.O., an Emmy Magnet, Steps Down", "category": "Business", "id": "3a9d4e40-2616-4dba-9273-9783a49db8d7", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/business/media/richard-plepler-hbo-ceo.html", "publishdate": 20190228, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/01/business/01HBO-2/merlin_141185553_6881cc69-66e1-4865-875d-66ab81342a56-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "Richard Plepler, the gregarious chief executive of HBO and one of the most influential executives in entertainment, abruptly stepped down on Thursday. His decision came eight months after AT&T acquired Time Warner, the network\u2019s corporate home, in an $85.4 billion deal.Mr. Plepler found he had less autonomy after the merger, according to two people familiar with his thinking.HBO, under his watch, won more than 160 Emmys for series like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d and \u201cVeep.\u201d From his office at the network\u2019s Manhattan headquarters overlooking Bryant Park, Mr. Plepler, 60, had a strong hand in creating what is often referred to as television\u2019s second golden age. He rose to prominence in a heyday for cable, and HBO\u2019s Sunday night lineups showcased critically acclaimed hits like \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cSex and the City,\u201d \u201cGirls\u201d and \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm.\u201dAT&T has been in talks with Robert Greenblatt, the former chairman of entertainment at NBC, for a high-level executive post at Warner Media, the division that oversees HBO under its Dallas-based minders. Before he ran programming at NBC, Mr. Greenblatt was in charge of entertainment at Showtime from 2003 to 2010, and oversaw shows like \u201cWeeds\u201d and \u201cNurse Jackie.\u201d After reports of the talks surfaced, it seemed unlikely to those who know Mr. Plepler that he would be willing to report to his onetime competitor.\u201cHard as it is to think about leaving the company I love, and the people I love in it, it is the right time for me to do so,\u201d Mr. Plepler said in a memo to HBO employees on Thursday. He added, \u201cI look forward over the coming weeks to thanking as many of you as I can for the thousands of contributions big and small that have made \u2018this thing of ours,\u2019 to quote Tony Soprano, so special.\u201dJohn Stankey, a longtime AT&T executive who became the chief executive of Warner Media last year, said in a statement, \u201cRichard is one of the most successful executives in our industry and I have been fortunate to have his support over the last months. His vision, energy and passion helped to elevate HBO\u2019s brand to what it has become today.\u201dThe combination of Mr. Stankey and Mr. Plepler may have been the stuff of a buddy comedy, but it didn\u2019t end with the mismatched duo growing closer in the end. The two executives differ significantly in style and attitude. Mr. Plepler is on the board of the Council on Foreign Relations; Mr. Stankey is on the board of UPS. Mr. Plepler is at ease working the room at a premiere party; Mr. Stankey, who recently moved from Dallas to New York, is a self-described \u201cBell head,\u201d a term that refers to his three decades at the telecommunications company, which included a stint at Southwestern Bell.The two men started discussing the idea of bringing Mr. Plepler\u2019s tenure to an end early in February, according to the two people familiar with the company\u2019s plans.On Tuesday, the United States Court of Appeals rejected the government\u2019s last-ditch attempt to break up the AT&T-Time Warner merger. The Justice Department said it would not appeal, leaving AT&T free to proceed with its plans.The industry in which Mr. Plepler thrived has been destabilized recently by the entry of big-spending digital rivals like Netflix and Amazon. Their threat to old ways of creating entertainment helped set in motion the recent mega-mergers in media and entertainment. In addition to AT&T\u2019s purchase of Time Warner, the Walt Disney Company is acquiring much of 21st Century Fox.Mr. Plepler joined HBO as a public relations official in 1992, some years after serving as an aide to Christopher J. Dodd, then a United States senator from Connecticut. Before long, Mr. Plepler oversaw HBO\u2019s communications department, but his position was greater than his title suggested. He became the face of HBO\u2019s New York operation, playing a key role in programming decisions.He moved into the role of co-president in 2007, after the network\u2019s chief executive at the time, Chris Albrecht, resigned after being accused of assaulting his girlfriend. Mr. Plepler became chief executive in 2013 and continued to show a knack for picking material that pleased critics while also delivering the occasional cheap thrill.During the early stages of AT&T\u2019s acquisition of Time Warner, Mr. Plepler strongly suggested that he would not give up his independence during an interview at his usual lunch spot, a corner booth at the Lambs Club, a restaurant two blocks from his office. In order for HBO to thrive, he insisted, there would have to be \u201ca Chinese wall\u201d between the network and its Dallas-based bosses. He also wondered aloud why the AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson would buy HBO if he had any plan that would involve \u201cmessing with a winning game.\u201dMr. Plepler\u2019s future came into clearer focus last June, when AT&T completed its acquisition of Time Warner, which was also the corporate home of the Warner Bros. movie studio and the cable networks CNN, TBS and TNT. Mr. Stankey addressed roughly 150 HBO employees during a town-hall meeting at the cozy HBO Theater on the 15th floor of the company\u2019s New York headquarters. He warned them of a \u201ctough year\u201d ahead, saying that it \u201cwill feel like childbirth.\u201dMr. Plepler shared the stage with Mr. Stankey that day, and there was a moment of public tension between them after the AT&T veteran promised more investment in HBO and Mr. Plepler interjected, \u201cLet\u2019s give him a hand for that simple sentence!\u201dReclaiming the stage, Mr. Stankey said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make money at the end of the day, right?\u201d\u201cWe do that,\u201d Mr. Plepler responded.\u201cYes, you do,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cJust not enough.\u201dThere was laughter in the room, but his blunt statements did not sit well with some employees.Profits rose during Mr. Plepler\u2019s run as chief executive, topping more than $2 billion in 2017. He introduced a stand-alone app, HBO Now, in 2015, which has more than five million subscribers. As someone who had grown accustomed to running his own shop, he seemed to chafe under his new boss from the start. His departure shows that AT&T is likely to be an active steward of Warner Media, one that did not hesitate to disrupt a network that is the division\u2019s crown jewel.Mr. Plepler sent his memo to HBO employees hours before he was expected to preside over another premiere party \u2014 lavish affairs were an HBO hallmark during his tenure \u2014 for a new documentary, \u201cThe Inventor,\u201d about the Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes. The director of that film, Alex Gibney, posted his disapproval not long after the news was public.\u201cDismaying,\u201d Mr. Gibney wrote. \u201cRichard is a great exec, powerful impresario and creative force. Great instinct for stories.\u201dMr. Plepler also hosted dinner parties and salons at his Upper East Side apartment and regarded himself as a sort of patron of the auteurs. On premiere nights and Emmy celebrations, he could be found bear-hugging, cajoling and propping up writers, actors and producers, not to mention the magazine editors and columnists he had brought into his fold.The talent loved him back, and sometimes even name-checked him in their work. In an episode of \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d Tony Soprano, after getting shot, is overseen by a doctor whom the show\u2019s creator, David Chase, named Dr. Lior Plepler. Likewise, Larry David\u2019s character in the HBO movie \u201cClear History\u201d invokes the name when referring to an expensive painting on his wall.\u201cIt\u2019s a Plepler!\u201d he says."}, {"title": "A New Editor, and a New Take on Brexit, for a Brawny London Tabloid", "category": "Business", "id": "1251d111-afe0-48a0-bae4-c944fe7c01ff", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/business/media/brexit-media-daily-mail.html", "publishdate": 20190228, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/28/business/28BREXITMEDIA-01/merlin_151286496_43e85f11-a514-4623-9ae4-622e3db9effe-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "LONDON \u2014 Just past the entrance to the airy headquarters of The Daily Mail, Britain\u2019s pugnacious and politically powerful publication, stands a sculpture of three small spheres with wings. The title is hidden away on a small plaque: \u201cBullets of Information.\u201dQuite.Few papers in the run-up to the Brexit referendum weaponized the tabloid tools of rumor, innuendo and invective like The Mail, whose lurid, factually murky warnings of immigrant violence and European Union evils helped tip the Leave campaign over the finish line. The paper\u2019s pro-Brexit agitating is often Exhibit A in liberal Londoners\u2019 worries over the effect of \u201cfake news\u201d on the outcome of that 2016 vote.So it was a little strange this month to find The Mail praising Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s \u201ctireless struggle to secure an orderly departure\u201d from Europe, even as hard-line Brexiteers objected to her compromise approach. Or to read an editorial warning that exiting the E.U. without a negotiated plan \u2014 a so-called hard Brexit \u2014 could prove \u201ccatastrophic.\u201dIn October, the paper labeled some pro-Brexit members of Parliament \u201csaboteurs\u201d for their refusal to consider Mrs. May\u2019s compromise \u2014 possibly confusing Mail readers, who a mere 18 months earlier received a front page declaring the anti-Brexit forces \u201csaboteurs.\u201dThe shift, head-spinning by London tabloid standards, came courtesy of The Mail\u2019s new editor, Geordie Greig, who succeeded Paul Dacre last summer. Mr. Dacre, in the job for 26 years, was a snarling Fleet Street character deeply attuned to the grievances and resentments of \u2018Middle England,\u201d the working-man-at-the-pub viewpoint that The Mail has long purported to represent.ImageGeordie Greig, who took over The Daily Mail last summer, with his wife, Kathryn, in 2016.CreditDavid M. Benett/Getty ImagesMr. Greig is no Middle Englander. An Eton and Oxford graduate from a family that runs in royal circles \u2014 his grandfather was, for a time, a close confidant of King George VI \u2014 he edited the society magazine Tatler for nearly a decade. Inheriting Mr. Dacre\u2019s wood-toned office, he raised the low ceiling and installed artworks by old friends like David Hockney and Lucian Freud. (The Hockney consists of iPhones, embedded in a mirror, that display the artist\u2019s latest digital doodles.)Mr. Greig had opposed Brexit from the start. At The Mail on Sunday, a corporate cousin of The Daily Mail that he began editing in 2012, he published editorials that urged readers to stick with the E.U. When he accepted Mr. Dacre\u2019s role, some London friends were taken aback. Can a man-about-town journalist, friends with the likes of the author V. S. Naipaul and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, keep his reputation at the center of Brexit tabloid muck?With barely a month to go before the March 29 Brexit deadline, British journalists and politicians \u2014 not to mention the general public \u2014 are still struggling to understand what exactly could transpire when, or if, the break from Europe occurs.The uncertainty has trickled down to the tabloids, which remain potent players in the Brexit debate and unabashed in using their pages to further an editorial view \u2014 more akin to cable news in the United States, where pundits hash out talking points and the political class pays heed.Some papers have shown introspection, with the editor of the pro-Brexit Daily Express admitting to a parliamentary committee that his paper\u2019s coverage had left him \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d and \u201ccreated an Islamophobic sentiment.\u201d Others are unchanged: On Wednesday, after the Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was prepared to support a second referendum, the Rupert Murdoch-owned Sun blasted out the headline \u201cBETRAYAL.\u201dWhat Is Brexit? A Simple Guide to Why It Matters and What Happens NextThe basics of Brexit, the troubled plan for Britain to quit the European Union.The Mail\u2019s enduring influence here makes its evolution all the more striking. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to The Daily Mail under Geordie could have long-lasting, even historic consequences,\u201d said David Yelland, a former editor of The Sun. \u201cHere is the beloved daily newspaper of Middle England, the prime hard Brexit cheerleader suddenly arguing for a common-sense compromise.\u201dMr. Greig is reluctant to speak about his editorship, and he declined to comment for this article. But the attitude that generated notorious Mail headlines like \u201cEnemies of the People\u201d \u2014 a Dacre-era front page denouncing three obscure British judges, complete with names and head shots \u2014 has started to fade.Whether Mr. Greig\u2019s changes are a betrayal or a betterment \u2014 or make good business sense \u2014 is a matter of lively debate. With about 1.2 million daily print subscribers, The Mail remains a predominant force in British culture and the halls of Westminster. (The Mail\u2019s website is also among the most popular news sites in the world, though British politics make up a fraction of its celebrity-heavy content.)Mr. Greig has won praise from Remainers like Alan Rusbridger, the former Guardian editor, who wrote in a recent column that The Mail \u201chas stopped behaving like a punch-drunk old bruiser lurching around in search of a brawl.\u201d\u201cInstead,\u201d Mr. Rusbridger added, \u201cit feels like it might be ready to be part of a broader, calmer conversation about the future.\u201dImageA Brexit demonstration in London on Tuesday. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to The Daily Mail under Geordie could have long-lasting, even historic consequences,\u201d said David Yelland, a former editor of The Sun.CreditAlexander Coggin for The New York TimesBrexit partisans, though, say The Mail has turned its back on readers.\u201cNot a softening \u2014 a reversal,\u201d Stephen K. Bannon, the former Breitbart News impresario, who has championed right-wing movements across Europe, said when asked about the changes at the paper.Mr. Greig\u2019s allies, mindful that Mr. Dacre still lurks at The Mail as an executive, take pains to say his changes are merely in tone \u2014 that The Mail still supports Brexit, only a more pragmatic, let\u2019s-think-this-through kind of Brexit.And Mr. Dacre \u2014 whose fondness for a certain four-letter word for a female body part led colleagues to refer to his meetings as \u201cthe vagina monologues\u201d \u2014 has not gone quietly. In a column ahead of his departure, he wrote: \u201cSupport for Brexit is in the DNA of both The Daily Mail and, more pertinently, its readers. Any move to reverse this would be editorial and commercial suicide.\u201dThe Mail is still a scold, particularly about the foibles of celebrities and royals, and its retrograde views on sex and romance are mostly unchanged. A Valentine\u2019s Day guide this year urged lonely women to avoid turning off male suitors by shedding \u201cgloomy\u201d titles from bookshelves and ridding their homes of cactuses, which were deemed \u201cunwelcoming.\u201dNatalie Fenton, chairwoman of the Media Reform Coalition, a British good-journalism group, acknowledged that The Mail \u201cis not your Nigel Farage \u2018Brexit or Die\u2019 anymore.\u201d (Mr. Farage, a former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, was an early Brexit backer.)ImageThe old Daily Mail: Under its previous editor, Paul Dacre, the tabloid drew criticism for its strident tone on Brexit.CreditThe Daily MailBut Ms. Fenton, a professor at the University of London who studies Britain\u2019s media market, said in an interview that the broader London tabloid scene was not that different, despite concerns over misinformation after Brexit.\u201cYou can still pick up a paper any day of the week and get an anti-immigration story,\u201d she said.Like others here, Ms. Fenton said her biggest concern was that the Brexit coverage might not help Britons grasp how it would affect their lives.\u201cThere is very little public understanding, and the media has got to take responsibility for that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe majority of reporting is conflictual still\u201d \u2014 who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in Parliament, for instance. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the real consequences.\u201dThe Mail has the second-highest circulation of any British paper, trailing only the down-market Sun and far outpacing liberal favorites like The Guardian, whose editorial page is sharply against Brexit.One sign of the paper\u2019s shift came in mid-February, when a top adviser to Mrs. May was overheard in Brussels suggesting that the prime minister could extend the Brexit deadline. The Daily Express \u2014 which has the slogan \u201cWe\u2019re Backing Britain\u201d on its front page \u2014 ran the story on its front page, declaring, \u201cSecret Brexit Plot Exposed in Hotel Bar.\u201dImageA Brexit protester on Tuesday. The head of a media watchdog group said she worried that tabloid coverage wasn\u2019t helping Britons grasp how Brexit would affect their lives.CreditAlexander Coggin for The New York TimesThe same day\u2019s Mail placed the news on Page 10, with the relatively subdued headline \u201cMay\u2019s Brexit Chief in Bar Blunder.\u201d On the cover, instead, was a celebratory piece about the success of the paper\u2019s anti-litter campaign, the Great British Spring Clean.As the three-year anniversary of the Brexit vote looms, with no clear resolution in sight, it\u2019s also possible that average British readers simply want to think about something else.Over tea in the dining hall at Portcullis House, the parliamentary office building, Ian Dunt, the editor of Politics.co.uk, lamented that the marathon machinations of Brexit had left readers numb. Compared with President Trump\u2019s tenure, Brexit \u201cis much more boring,\u201d he said, dryly.And given falling circulation numbers and the mass digital migration of news, Mr. Dunt questioned if the revised tone at The Mail, or any other paper, would do much to change minds.He may have a point. Around the corner from The Mail\u2019s headquarters on Kensington High Street, a newsstand vendor, a man in late middle age, was asked if he had noticed anything different about the paper\u2019s Brexit coverage.\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d he replied, with an apologetic smile. \u201cI just do the crossword.\u201d"}, {"title": "Facebook and Telegram Are Hoping to Succeed Where Bitcoin Failed", "category": "Business", "id": "346bc17f-e2f4-40cf-ba67-41c785fc38c8", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/technology/cryptocurrency-facebook-telegram.html", "publishdate": 20190228, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/01/business/01socialcoin/28socialcoin-promo-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Some of the world\u2019s biggest internet messaging companies are hoping to succeed where cryptocurrency start-ups have failed by introducing mainstream consumers to the alternative world of digital coins.The internet outfits, including Facebook, Telegram and Signal, are planning to roll out new cryptocurrencies over the next year that are meant to allow users to send money to contacts on their messaging systems, like a Venmo or PayPal that can move across international borders.The most anticipated but secretive project is underway at Facebook. The company is working on a coin that users of WhatsApp, which Facebook owns, could send to friends and family instantly, said five people briefed on the effort who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.The Facebook project is far enough along that the social networking giant has held conversations with cryptocurrency exchanges about selling the Facebook coin to consumers, said four people briefed on the negotiations.Telegram, which has an estimated 300 million users worldwide, is also working on a digital coin. A coin is in the works that will work with Signal, an encrypted messaging service that is popular among technologists and privacy advocates. And so do the biggest messaging applications in South Korea and Japan, Kakao and Line.The messaging companies have a reach that dwarfs the backers of earlier cryptocurrencies. Facebook and Telegram can make the digital wallets used for cryptocurrencies available, in an instant, to hundreds of millions of users.All of the new projects are going after a market that has already proved popular with consumers. Venmo has taken off in the United States by making it easier to send payments by phone. And in China, many consumers use the payment system that operates inside the hugely popular WeChat messaging system.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much the most fascinating thing happening in crypto right now,\u201d said Eric Meltzer, a co-founder of a cryptocurrency-focused venture capital firm, Primitive Ventures. \u201cThey each have their own advantage in this battle, and it will be insane to watch it go down.\u201dIn a statement, Facebook did not directly address its work on a digital coin. The other companies declined to comment on their projects. Most of them appear to be working on digital coins that could exist on a decentralized network of computers, independent to some degree of the companies that created them.Like Bitcoin, the new cryptocurrencies would make it easier to move money between countries, particularly in the developing world where it is hard for ordinary people to open bank accounts and buy things online. The current designs being discussed generally do away with the energy-guzzling mining process that Bitcoin relies on.But the messaging companies are likely to face many of the same regulatory and technological hurdles that have kept Bitcoin from going mainstream. The lack of a central authority over cryptocurrencies \u2014 a government or a bank \u2014 has made them useful to criminals and scammers, and the designs of the computer networks that manage them make it hard to handle significant numbers of transactions.\u201cThey are all going to run up against these same types of technological limits,\u201d said Richard Ma, the chief executive of Quantstamp, a firm that provides security audits for new cryptocurrencies.The companies are throwing significant resources into their projects, even as the prices of cryptocurrencies have plunged over the last year.Facebook has more than 50 engineers working on its project, three people familiar with the effort said. An industry website, The Block, has been keeping track of the steady flow of new job listings for the Facebook project.The Facebook effort, which is being run by a former president of PayPal, David Marcus, started last year after Telegram raised an eye-popping $1.7 billion to fund its cryptocurrency project.Facebook has been coy about what it is building. The team is in an office with separate key-card access so other Facebook employees cannot get in, according to two Facebook employees.Facebook is looking at several ways to use the blockchain, the technology introduced by Bitcoin that makes it possible to keep shared records of financial transactions on several computers, rather than relying on one big central player like PayPal or Visa.The five people who have been briefed on the Facebook team\u2019s work said the company\u2019s most immediate product was likely to be a coin that would be pegged to the value of traditional currencies, as Bloomberg first reported.A digital token with a stable value would not be attractive to speculators \u2014 the main audience for cryptocurrencies so far \u2014 but it would allow consumers to hold it and pay for things without worrying about the value of the coin rising and falling.Several other companies have recently introduced so-called stablecoins, linked to the value of the dollar. JPMorgan Chase even said it was experimenting with the concept last month.Facebook is looking at pegging the value of its coin to a basket of different foreign currencies, rather than just the dollar, three people briefed on the plans said. Facebook could guarantee the value of the coin by backing every coin with a set number of dollars, euros and other national currencies held in Facebook bank accounts.The company is overhauling its messaging infrastructure, which would connect three of its properties \u2014 Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram. That integration, which could take more than a year, would extend the reach of Facebook\u2019s digital currency across the 2.7 billion people who use one of the three apps each month.The big question facing Facebook is how much control it would retain over the digital coin. If Facebook is responsible for approving every transaction and keeping track of every user, it is not clear why it would need a blockchain system, rather than a traditional, centralized system like PayPal.Working with cryptocurrency exchanges would take at least some of the regulatory burden off Facebook, since the exchanges would be responsible for holding the digital coins and vetting customers.But if Facebook goes with a coin it does not entirely control, it will be harder for the company to make money from transaction fees and easier for criminals to use the coin for illegal purposes.Facebook employees have told the exchanges that they are hoping to get a product out in the first half of the year.The coins from the other messaging companies are likely to look more like traditional cryptocurrencies, with fluctuating values and a decentralized design that would give users more control.Telegram, which was started by a team of Russian exiles, has prided itself on thumbing its nose at governments. This could help Telegram in places like Iran and Russia, where people \u2014 especially dissidents \u2014 have difficulty using the traditional financial system.Telegram sent a letter to its investors last month saying that it was 90 percent done with the key components of the network that would house the Gram, the name for its digital token.The company has told investors that it hopes to have some version of the system out in the next few months, according to two investors who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.Another team is building a digital token, Mobilecoin, designed to work inside the privacy-focused messaging application Signal. The project raised $30 million last year and is trying to raise another $30 million, according to three people briefed on the effort.While the founder of Signal, Moxie Marlinspike, is advising the effort, it is being run independently of Signal. The project is a favorite of many longtime cryptocurrency advocates because of strong privacy controls.But Mobilecoin, like the other projects underway, will still have to solve the problems that have stopped all the other cryptocurrencies from living up to expectations.\u201cThe jury is still out\u201d on their effectiveness, Mr. Ma of Quantstamp said."}, {"title": "U.S. Economy Cooled as G.D.P.

That marks a significant slowdown from the middle of the year, when a sugar high fueled by tax cuts and government spending increases briefly pushed growth above 4 percent.This year seems to be starting at an even slower pace. Many economists expect growth to drop below 2 percent in the first quarter, in part because of the partial government shutdown, which began in December and extended through most of January.It\u2019s important to keep the cooling economy in perspective. The fourth-quarter slowdown wasn\u2019t as severe as many forecasters had feared, and even with the loss of momentum late in the year, 2018 as a whole was among the best years of the decade-long recovery from the Great Recession. And most economists do not expect a recession this year, putting the current expansion on track to become the longest on record.\u201cI think this is a slowing,\u201d said Lewis Alexander, chief United States economist for Nomura. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is \u2018we\u2019re falling into an abyss.\u2019\u201dA strong year \u2014 but how strong?Thursday\u2019s report did give President Trump some bragging rights \u2014 albeit with an asterisk.Economic output rose 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. That\u2019s a politically salient benchmark because Mr. Trump and his advisers have repeatedly promised growth of 3 percent or better, something his predecessor never achieved over a full calendar year. (Mr. Trump has at other times promised growth of 4 percent or more.)\u201cA year of 3.1 percent growth is something many people thought was impossible as recently as 2016, so it\u2019s a major accomplishment,\u201d said Kevin Hassett, chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cAnd it\u2019s an accomplishment that has disproportionately benefited low-wage and blue-collar workers.\u201dStill, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t quite score a clear victory. By another commonly used method of calculating annual growth \u2014 which looks at G.D.P. over full years, not just comparing the fourth quarter of each year \u2014 the economy fell just short of that mark, coming in at 2.9 percent. Whether growth hits 3 percent might matter politically, but it makes little difference economically. The difference between 2.9 percent and 3 percent growth is negligible in any one year, and, in any case, the Commerce Department will revise its fourth-quarter estimate in March.The White House expects the roughly 3 percent pace of growth to continue in 2019 and for years into the future. Few independent economists agree. With the effects of the tax cuts and spending increases fading, the Federal Reserve expects growth to slow to 2.3 percent in 2019, and many economists are even more pessimistic.ImageA residential development in Southern California. The housing market slowed in 2018, putting a drag on the economy.CreditMike Blake/ReutersSlower, but not slowThe fourth-quarter slowdown wasn\u2019t as bad as some forecasters had expected. Consumer spending, the bedrock of the economy, rose at a 2.6 percent rate \u2014 slower than in the middle of the year, but hardly a collapse. Exports, which slumped in the third quarter, rebounded in the fourth, suggesting that the cooling global economy isn\u2019t yet dragging down American exporters. And businesses stepped up their investment in equipment, software and research, a sign that they are still betting on the future.Still, uncertainty about the direction of the economy has made some businesses more cautious. George Whittier, who oversees operations for the Morey Corporation, a manufacturer outside Chicago, said business was strong in 2018 but began to slow at the end of the year. He shrugged off weakness in December as a seasonal blip. But then January was softer, and February was softer still.Morey, which makes electronic components for cars, medical devices and other uses, has been hit by Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, which raised prices on imported parts from China. At first, the impact was small, but it has grown as suppliers draw down inventories and are forced to import more.\u201cAs each month has gone by, it has seemed like more and more components have been affected,\u201d Mr. Whittier said.For now, Mr. Whittier remains optimistic that the trade tensions will be resolved and 2019 will prove to be a good year. But he is taking a wait-and-see approach when it comes to making big investments.The stimulus effects are fadingThursday\u2019s report left little doubt that the midyear surge in growth has dissipated, just as many economists predicted at the time. Tax cuts and federal spending increases provided a temporary lift, but that was offset by higher interest rates, trade tensions and a slowing global economy. And the effects of the stimulus will fade further in 2019.Residential investment, a proxy for housing construction, fell for the fourth straight quarter, as higher interest rates and declining affordability weighed on construction and sales. Retail sales dropped unexpectedly in December, which could be a sign that consumers are starting to pull back. And growth in the fourth quarter was driven in part by companies building up inventories, which could reverse in 2019.\u201cOn the one hand, I was encouraged that there wasn\u2019t as much of a slowing as I thought,\u201d said Ben Herzon, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm. \u201cBut on the other hand, what propped up growth in the fourth quarter was unsustainable.\u201dThe government shutdown came too late to make much difference to the fourth quarter, but it could be a significant drag on growth early in the year. The funding lapse idled hundreds of thousands of federal workers, left hundreds of thousands more working without pay and disrupted air travel, among other effects. Consumer confidence plummeted. Macroeconomic Advisers on Thursday cut its estimate of growth in the current quarter to 1.1 percent. Growth that weak would leave the United States with little buffer against an unexpected round of bad news \u2014 an escalation in the trade war with China, for example, or another round of fiscal gamesmanship around the debt ceiling. A rising share of economists expect a recession in 2020 if not sooner.\u201cThe economy\u2019s already slowing and there are a bunch of reasons why it could slow down even more, and that just makes you vulnerable,\u201d said Mr. Alexander of Nomura. \u201cIt would take less of a shock to push you over the edge\u201d into a recession.Is there reason for optimism?Not everyone is so pessimistic. Most economists believe the shutdown did little long-term damage to the economy. Consumer confidence rebounded in February as federal workers returned to work and the stock market bounced back from its December slump. Job growth never suffered.\u201cThe fears of the economic expansion\u2019s demise seem to have been greatly exaggerated,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist for Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services. She called Thursday\u2019s report promising, and said it suggested the economy entered 2019 on firmer footing than some economists had feared.There are other reasons to think the economy could prove resilient. Trade tensions with China seem to have eased somewhat in recent weeks. The Federal Reserve has backed off plans to raise interest rates. And the combination of low unemployment, rising wages and low oil prices should help drive consumer spending.\u201cAll the fundamentals are there for a solid consumer recovery,\u201d said Michael Pearce of Capital Economics.MORE ON THE ECONOMYRally in Stocks and Bonds Reveals Diverging Views on the EconomyFeb. 22, 2019Fed Explains Pause as Officials Debate Future Rate IncreasesFeb. 20, 2019Housing Is Already in a Slump.

Unclear.\u201cAmy and I have made a decision about how we can best serve our country,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke, the former congressman from Texas, said in the briefest of statements, referring to his wife, Amy Sanders. \u201cWe are excited to share it with everyone soon.\u201d[Stay up-to-date on the growing Democratic field with our candidate tracker.]Mr. O\u2019Rourke, who served in the House from 2013 through the beginning of 2019, made a national name for himself last year when he gave Senator Ted Cruz a surprisingly strong challenge in a reliably conservative state. Mr. Cruz was re-elected by less than three percentage points. Six years earlier, he had won by 16 points.In his Senate campaign, Mr. O\u2019Rourke fired up Texas Democrats with a broadly liberal message and a charismatic stage presence, while also pulling in donations from across the country.Some political observers have been urging him to try to replicate that campaign in 2020 against Texas\u2019 other Republican senator, John Cornyn, rather than enter one of the most crowded Democratic primary fields in history.The announcement-of-a-coming-announcement was first reported by The Dallas Morning News Wednesday afternoon. The paper, citing anonymous sources \u201cclose to the former El Paso congressman,\u201d also reported that Mr. O\u2019Rourke had decided not to challenge Mr. Cornyn, who is up for re-election next year. Such a decision would suggest that Mr. O\u2019Rourke was leaning toward a run for the presidency.Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s spokesman, Chris Evans, would not comment on whether the former congressman had decided to forgo a 2020 Senate run.But since almost the moment he conceded in November, the larger speculation has been whether he will try to translate his appeal in Texas, where he presented himself as a unifier, to a national primary in which Democratic voters have shown an appetite for more strongly progressive policies.He placed well in some early polls, landing as high as third in mid-January behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. (who has not decided whether he will run) and Senator Bernie Sanders (who entered the race last week). In more recent polls, Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren have surpassed him."}, {"title": "Live From America\u2019s Capital, a TV Station Run by China\u2019s Communist Party", "category": "Business", "id": "17b53823-370b-49bd-91bc-ba202ff42464", "sourceurl": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/business/cctv-china-usa-propaganda.html", "publishdate": 20190228, "imageurl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/09/business/0008cctv1-print/merlin_150591996_6411fc17-1101-47e7-85f6-a3ac962d939b-articleLarge.jpg", "content": "It broadcasts forced confessions to American audiences.

In the wake of Russian influence in the 2016 election, American officials are trying to get a clearer picture of efforts by China and other countries to build influence in the United States. The claim by CGTN America, an overtly state-owned organization, represents a direct challenge to that effort. \u201cThey have put the Department of Justice into a position of looking utterly ridiculous and toothless if it simply walks away from this type of false claim,\u201d said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.\u201cThis is right up there with Pravda claiming to be a health magazine,\u201d he added, referring to the onetime official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. \u201cOn its face, it doesn\u2019t hold.\u201dFacing Legal Scrutiny, China\u2019s State TV Recalls Its U.S. HeadMarch 8, 2019CGTN America, based in Washington, is part of the international arm of China Central Television, Beijing\u2019s main domestic propaganda organ. It runs a typical newsroom except when it comes to stories about China, said four current and former employees, who asked for anonymity to protect their careers. Some stories, like the 2012 escape from China of the activist lawyer Chen Guangcheng or 2014 protests in Hong Kong calling for freer elections, were covered only briefly days after the news broke, three of them said. Employees were rebuked when a report mentioned Falun Gong, the religious group that Beijing considers a cult, they said. Images of the flag of Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims, are banned from broadcasts.CGTN made the filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, at the urging of the Justice Department. FARA requires those doing publicity work for foreign-controlled groups to submit government disclosures. American officials have stepped up their requests that foreign-controlled groups make FARA filings in response to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Two years ago RT America, a Russian-backed broadcaster, made a similar filing at the urging of the Justice Department. Chinese companies and organizations in general have come under greater scrutiny as the trade war has intensified, including the deals they strike to buy up American firms and technology. Some American officials contend the companies can pose a security risk. As part of its demands that CGTN America make a filing under FARA, the Justice Department in a December letter to the broadcaster said it put Mr. Xi in a positive light and had attempted to influence the American public during the recent trade dispute. \u201cReporting China\u2019s policy positions and presenting them in a positive light are primary reasons for CGTN\u2019s existence,\u201d the letter said. The Justice Department\u2019s Letter to CGTN AmericaIn December, the Justice Department sent a letter to CGTN America, the American arm of state-run China Central Television, outlining the reasons why it should register as a foreign agent.

American officials sometimes challenge filings, requiring registrants to disclose more data about their relationships with foreign governments.Unlike the Russian influence campaign, which is designed to split Americans, the Chinese propaganda effort tends toward the sunny side. Recent broadcasts on CGTN America extolled traditional Chinese medicine and China\u2019s economic rise, while its website offers a link to its panda coverage.China\u2019s influence push may be ham-handed compared with Russia\u2019s, but it is well funded. Official Chinese media spend heavily to advertise on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter that are banned within China. China Daily, an English-language, state-controlled newspaper, buys advertising inserts in American newspapers, including The New York Times.Based in a glassy office building four blocks from the White House, CGTN America employs about 180 journalists \u2014 many of them Americans \u2014 devoted to covering the United States. It broadcasts seven hours of programming a day through cable and satellite providers like AT&T and Comcast. Its employees cover a wide variety of topics, from news to features to business, and occasionally win awards for their coverage. Ma Jing, CGTN America\u2019s director general, said the broadcaster \u201cenjoys editorial independence from any state direction or control.\u201d \u201cCGTN America is not engaged in \u2018political activities,\u2019 as that term is defined for purposes of FARA, and has elected to file this registration statement out of an abundance of caution and in the spirit of cooperation with U.S. authorities,\u201d Ms. Ma wrote in the filing with the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.Current and former CGTN employees say CCTV editors in Beijing often dictated plans for covering China. American employees sometimes pushed back, they said, and Ms. Ma allowed some flexibility when Beijing\u2019s orders didn\u2019t specifically forbid or dictate content. But three people interviewed said they had little choice but to air propaganda clips when Beijing said so. For instance, in November CGTN America was told to broadcast a piece that played down China\u2019s imprisonment of hundreds of thousands of members of the Uighur ethnic minority group. The Times and others have reported that the mostly Muslim Uighurs are held against their will, often in dismal conditions, and subject to an indoctrination program designed to discourage Islam.The piece that aired portrayed the camps as successful vocational training and antiterrorism centers and Uighurs as grateful. CGTN America employees packaged the clips with context citing international criticism, but the video nonetheless ran, at times without their framing.Other times there was less recourse. CGTN has broadcast the televised confessions of people accused of a wide variety of crimes in China, with those confessions sometimes touted internally as \u201cexclusives\u201d by editors, one former employee said. Human rights groups say China forces people to make false, televised confessions to serve its own propaganda needs.CGTN broadcast the confession of Peter Humphrey, a British private investigator who was imprisoned in China in 2013 and accused of illegally obtaining and selling Chinese citizens\u2019 data. Mr. Humphrey, who has since been released, said he had been drugged, chained to a chair, locked in a cage and then made to read out a statement written by the police in front of the cameras. The anchor who presented the footage, James Chau, is now a goodwill ambassador with the World Health Organization. He declined to comment.ImagePeter Humphrey, a British private investigator who was once jailed in China. His confession, which he said had been forced, was broadcast by CGTN\u2019s forerunner.CreditFrank Augstein/Associated PressThe news organization \u201ccollaborates with the security and police organs to extract forced confessions from prisoners under extreme conditions of duress,\u201d Mr. Humphrey said, adding that the confession was packaged to \u201cdistort reality, intrude on privacy and fairness, and humiliate me.\u201dChinese leaders get different treatment, said three current or former employees. During a 2014 visit by Mr. Xi to Greece, a clip that showed him getting off the plane with unruly hair was eradicated from broadcasts, one current employee said.One CGTN America show, \u201cThe Heat,\u201d is occasionally edited if it is too critical of China, two of the people said.\u201cCGTN wouldn\u2019t exist or have any significant funding if it weren\u2019t for the Chinese government,\u201d said Sarah Cook, a senior analyst for East Asia at Freedom House, a pro-democracy research group in the United States. \u201cAnd of course that comes with editorial strings attached.\u201d The Chinese government\u2019s power over CGTN was underscored by a 2016 event at state media facilities in Beijing in which Mr. Xi said official media and publicity broadly were \u201ccrucial for the party\u2019s path.\u201d A group of CGTN employees in Washington attended via video conference. They had been kept after midnight several days in advance to prepare, without being told why, according to two of the people. When Mr. Xi greeted them, the group waved and, in a rehearsed moment, called out in unison, \u201cGood morning, President Xi.\u201d The moment became a source of tension internally, these people said.\u201cMedia analysts say this is very much about cultivating a more robust image for the Chinese leader,\u201d the CGTN America anchor Roee Ruttenberg said in the channel\u2019s coverage of Mr. Xi\u2019s appearance, \u201cthrough all of the different outlets that in theory fall under his control.\u201d"}]}
