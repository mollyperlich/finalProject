# Final Project Proposal

Team:
* Molly Perlich
* Scott McEachern
* Fiona Weston
* Connie Hu
* David Matthews
* Joey Ashcroft

Dataset:
* We're using ML to analyze Yelp dataset (https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge)

Our problem worth solving, analyzing or visualizing:
* Use ML to create model to analyze and utilize big data from Yelp

How we will use ML:
* Train model to find location based on photo (example: waffles)
* Create sentiment analysis model to see if we can predict the rating of said location
* Predict rating based on user's overall review sentiment (are they typically a troll or a cheerleader?)
* Implement host model in a website in order to demonstrate the analysis (using D3 or something similar)

Other languages/libraries used:
* HTML
* JS (D3)
* Amazon AWS 

Alternative project option:

* Use 10 news sources (CNN, WSJ, etc) to predict the health of a stock based on sentiment analysis.
