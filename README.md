# Final Project Proposal

Team:
* Molly Perlich
* Scott McEachern
* Fiona Weston
* Connie Hu
* David Mathews
* Joey Ashcroft

Dataset:
* We're using NLP to predict the health of a stock (whether we should buy, sell or hold) based on news stories from the previous day.

Our problem worth solving, analyzing or visualizing:
* Use ML to create model to analyze and utilize big data from New York Times.

How we will use ML: 
* Extract key information using the New York Time's API
* Add content of each article using Beautiful Soup 
* Train classificiation model to predict health of a stock based on content of news articles from the previous day
* Create sentiment analysis model to see if we can predict the direction of the stock price/whether or not they should buy, sell or hold
* Implement host model in a website in order to demonstrate the analysis (using D3 or something similar)

Other languages/libraries used:
* HTML
* JS (D3) / Plotly
* Amazon AWS
