# Final Project Proposal

Team:
* Molly Perlich
* Scott McEachern
* Fiona Weston
* Connie Hu
* David Mathews
* Joey Ashcroft

Dataset:
* We're using NLP to predict the health of a stock based on news stories from the previous day.

Our problem worth solving, analyzing or visualizing:
* Use ML to create model to analyze and utilize big data from New York Times

How we will use ML: 
* Train classificiation model to predict health of a stock based on content of news articles from the previous day
* Create sentiment analysis model to see if we can predict the rating of said location
* Predict rating based on user's overall review sentiment (are they typically a troll or a cheerleader?)
* Narrow the variables of a page's reviews based on sentiment analysis pertaining to subjects like 'service' or 'atmosphere'
* Implement host model in a website in order to demonstrate the analysis (using D3 or something similar)

Other languages/libraries used:
* HTML
* JS (D3)
* Amazon AWS 

Alternative project option:

* Use 10 news sources (CNN, WSJ, etc) to predict the health of a stock based on sentiment analysis.
